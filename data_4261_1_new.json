In addition to common resolution enhancement techniques such as off-axis illumination, edge movement, or applying sub-resolution assist features, Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) tools available commercially at this moment offer means of extending current in-house tool resolution and enlarging process window for random as well as periodic mask patterns. In this paper we explore ILT pattern simplification procedures and model calibration for a range of illumination conditions. We study random pattern fidelity and critical dimension stability across process window for 65nm contact layer, and compare silicon results for both conventional optical proximity correction and inverse lithography techniques.", "The 22nm node will be patterned with very challenging Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RETs) such as double exposure or double patterning. Even with those extreme RETs, the k1 factor is expected to be less than 0.3. There is some concern in the industry that traditional edge-based simulate-then-move Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) may not be up to the challenges expected at the 22nm node. Previous work presented the advantages of a so-called inverse OPC approach when coupled with extreme RETs or illumination schemes. The smooth mask contours resulting from inverse corrections were shown not to be limited by topological identity, feedback locality, or fragment conformity. In short, inverse OPC can produce practically unconstrained and often non-intuitive mask shapes. The authors will expand this comparison between traditional and inverse OPC to include likely 22nm RETs such as double dipole lithography and double patterning, comparing dimensional control through process window for each OPC method. The impact of mask simplification of the inverse OPC shapes into shapes which can be reliably manufactured will also be explored.", "We propose an inversion calculation method based on a simple \"pixel-flipping\" approach. The simple method features innovative wavefront-expansion and wavefront-based damping techniques in order to obtain accentuated corrections near the drawn pattern. The method is first employed to be a stand-alone optical proximity correction solution that directly calculates the corrected masks with acceptable contours and image contrast. In addition, a model-based pre-OPC flow, where the initial sizing of drawn patterns and surrounding sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) are simultaneously generated in a single iteration using this inversion calculation is also proposed to minimize technology-transition risks and costs. A mask simplification technique based on the central moments is introduced in order to snap the corrections into 45 degree and axis-aligned line segments. This approach allows achieving optimized corrections while minimizing the impact to the existing and validated correction flow.", "In this paper, we will outline the approach for optimizing the illumination conditions to print three-dimensional images in resist stacks of varying sensitivity in a single exposure. The algorithmic approach for acheiving both optimal common and weakest window is presented. Results will be presented which demonstrate the ability of the technique to create threedimensional structures. The performance of the common and weakest window formulation will be explored using this approach. Additionally, due to physical restrictions there are limitations to the type of patterns that can be printed with a single exposure in this manner, thus the abilities of such a technique will be explored.", "As IC manufacturing goes from 45nm to 30nm node half-pitch, the lithography process k1 factor will fall below 0.25 by using water-based ArF-immersion scanner. To bridge the gap between ArF-immersion and next generation lithography, which is not ready yet for production, Double Patterning Technology (DPT) has been evaluated and identified as a promising solution as it utilizes existing equipment and processes. Self Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) has the advantage of dense array definition without overlay issue and is hence useful for memory device; but its characteristic restricts the feasibility of two-dimensional circuit pattern definition on the other hand. This paper describes the ideas of 30nm node NAND FLASH cell circuit critical feature (pickup, gate, contact array) definition by decomposing the target patterns to SADP defined dense array in conjunction with cropping and/or periphery masks steps. The concerns and issues of cropping/periphery mask step process integration as well as SADP alignment algorithm are investigated, and the countermeasures with alternative process schemes and novel frame designs are presented. Finally, simulation prediction has shown that the capability of 30nm NAND FLASH critical features patterning with depth of focus equal to or above 0.15um is expected at each mask step by ArF-dry lithography.", "MRAM, a potential candidate of next generation or \"universal\" memory device, has been in process development and targeted for production. This high density non-volatile memory has a fast <20ns read/write cycle and unlimited endurance. Wordline layer is important for writing. Using KrF tool capability only, this \"line & contact hole\" wordline pattern must meet the challenge of aggressive pitch size shrinkage and process margin requirements in order to deliver reliable writing efficiency. Thus, appropriate process integration schemes demonstrating single exposure, double exposure and double patterning are compared. A comprehensive study from mask layout simulation and its cost to litho OL/CD process window experimental data analysis will be presented to achieve potential high yield manufacturing goal of the critical wordline design and process integration.", "Sidewall Spacer Double Patterning (SSDP) has been adopted for the primary patterning technique for 3x nm technology node and beyond in flash memory device manufacturing. Three mask flow are used in SSDP process scheme in order to form the actual device layer; Core mask to define the template pattern, Trim mask to cut (cropping) the unneeded line ends from sidewall spacer, and Pad mask to pattern the periphery structures. Inter-layer and intra-layers alignment with sidewall spacer double patterning requires some engineering efforts compared to traditional single patterning alignment techniques. In this paper, we study the impacts of hard-mask materials on the inter-layer alignment as well as the mark design and process flow impact on intra-layer alignment. For intra-layer alignment, we searched various ASML ATHENA alignment marks and found the only workable mark (VSPM-AA157 Polar). Although the wafer quality scores during alignment were less than 0.1% in many cases, the alignment was successful and yielded acceptable performance for research and development activities requiring less than 10nm misalignment. Further new mark design and test should be carried in implementing in sidewall spacer double patterning process.", "We developed an analysis system for simulating birefringence of an annealed ingot of CaF2 single crystal caused by the residual stress after annealing process. The analysis system comprises the heat conduction analysis that provides the temperature distribution during the ingot annealing, the stress analysis to calculate the residual stress after ingot annealing, and the birefringence analysis of an annealed ingot induced by the residual stress. In the residual stress calculation, we can select either the elastic thermal stress analysis using the assumption of a stress-free temperature or more exact stress analysis considering the time-dependent nonlinear behavior of a material called creep. When we use the residual stress calculated from the creep deformation analysis of a CaF2 ingot, we can obtain reasonable results both for the optical path difference values and for its distributions in comparison with the experimental results.", "The TWINSCAN XT:1000H extends KrF lithography to expose layers that previously required more costly ArF lithography. These layers, including implants and metal interconnects, contain multiple, through pitch or random, 2- dimensional (2D) features. In this paper, we show process windows for 115 nm random via holes using conventional illumination, 110 nm dense & isolated via holes using a soft quasar illumination shape, 95 nm trenches through pitch with an annular illumination mode as well as the process windows for a combination of patterns representative for implant structures using a soft annular illumination mode. We also prove that the XT:1000H can be integrated in an existing high volume manufacturing environment: transfer of a 65 nm logic metal-1 layer from a high NA XT:1400 dry ArF scanner to the XT:1000H has been evaluated by optimizing the illumination settings and applying advanced mask design approaches to meet requirements for exposure latitude, depth of focus and MEEF. In addition, we show that the CD proximity matching performance between the XT:1000H and NA 0.8 XT:850 KrF scanners can be maximized using illumination setting optimization and EFESE focus scan. Finally, matched machine overlay performance between the XT:1000H and an XT:1900Gi ArF immersion scanner has been evaluated.", "In advanced lithography processes, immersion lithography technology is beginning to be used in volume production at the 45-nm technology node. Beyond that, double-patterning immersion lithography is considered to be one of the promising technologies -meeting the requirements of the next-generation 32-nm technology node. Light source requirements for double patterning lithography tool are high power and high uptime to enhance economic efficiency, as well as extremely stable optical performances for high resolution capabilities. In this paper, the GT62A, Argon Fluoride (ArF) excimer laser light source which meets these requirements is introduced. The GT62A has an emission wavelength of 193-nm, a power output of 90 W and a repetition rate of 6,000 Hz. The dose uniformity of the GT62A was improved for reduction of Critical Dimension (CD) variation and better Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU). A stable wavelength and a spectrum bandwidth of the GT62A satisfy the requirements of the high resolution lithography tools which need the steady focus stability. In addition, we verified by simulation that the spectrum bandwidth control in the GT62A contributes to Depth of Focus (DOF) enhancement. The new technology for the light source and detailed optical performance data are presented.", "High lens numerical aperture for improving the resolution of a lithographic lens requires a high incident angle of exposure light in resist, which induces the vectorial effect. As a result, the vectorial effect has become more sensitive and vectorial fingerprint with higher accuracy has been required for effective image forming simulation. We successfully obtained true polarization characteristics of projection optics without the effect of measurement optics for more accurate image forming simulation. Accuracy of the result of separating Jones matrix of projection optics and that of measurement optics are presented.", "ArF immersion technology is spotlighted as the enabling technology for the 45nm node and beyond. Recently, double exposure technology is also considered as a possible candidate for the 32nm node and beyond. We have already released an injection lock ArF excimer laser, the GT61A (60W/6kHz/10mJ/0.35pm) with ultra line-narrowed spectrum and stabilized spectrum performance for immersion lithography tools with N.A.>1.3, and we have been monitoring the field reliability data of our lasers used in the ArF immersion segment since Q4 2006. We show GT series reliability data in the field. GT series have high reliability performance. The availability that exceeds 99.5% proves the reliability of the GT series. We have developed high power injection lock ArF excimer laser for double patterning, the GT62A (90W/6000Hz/15mJ/0.35pm(E95)) based on the GigaTwin (GT) platform. Number of innovative and unique technologies are implemented on GT62A in order to reduce running cost of laser. We have introduced unique technology to enable 40 billion pulse lifetime of laser chambers to drastically reduce running cost. In addition, we have improved lifetime of Line Narrowing Module significantly by changing optical path. Furthermore, the extension of gas refill intervals was achieved by introducing new gas supply module and sophisticated gas control algorithm. We achieved the reduction of operation cost and down time by introducing these three technologies.", "In immersion lithography, importance is placed on technology for controlling coating along the edge of the wafer. In the case of a top-coat process, it has been observed that the top coat can peel off during immersion exposure due to weak adhesion to the substrate, a characteristic of top-coat films. The peeling of the film is thought to adversely affect immersion-exposure equipment and the wafer surface by the formation of defects due to the contamination of the immersion-exposure tool and by residual particles. Nikon Corporation and Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TEL) have performed joint research and development in response to these problems. TEL has studied rinsing technology for the wafer edge section and established coating processes and control techniques that rinse the edge section to remove foreign matter and that control the cutting position of each film in the edge section. TEL has developed new processes and hardware to remove foreign matter introduced into the immersion-exposure tool, and has shown that this technology can help prevent contamination of exposure equipment. Nikon has established efficient on-body periodic rinsing as a new technology for exposure equipment that can reduce defect.", "Leading-edge scanners in fabs worldwide have particularly high system utilization and require peak levels of system throughput and availability. Laser gas exchanges typically occur daily on these systems (or every 100M pulses or less), with each exchange lasting up to 20 minutes. This downtime has a direct negative effect on availability, and if it is reduced, the productivity of the litho cell increases. This paper will outline the immediate success fabs have experienced after equipping scanners with Cymer's Gas Lifetime eXtension (GLXTM) technology, which increases scanner availability by extending the time between excimer laser gas exchanges by a factor of more than 10. To date, more than 100 leading-edge scanners feature Cymer's GLX technology, which has improved light source availability by more than 1.5 percent. Moreover, multiple chipmakers report more than 2 percent improvement in litho cell productivity due to GLX, corresponding to 2000 wafers/month increase for a 100,000 wafers/month fab. The increase in measured productivity is the leveraged benefit of reducing process interruptions around the refill cycle GLX technology extends the shot-based interval between gas refills to 1 billion pulses for Cymer's XLA light sources, and provides excellent stability in key optical performance parameters, such as bandwidth and dose stability over the entire gas life. This paper will provide extensive performance data during extended light source operation on litho cells equipped with GLX technology, and multiple use scenarios will be examined, including usage at memory and logic fabs. The paper will also discuss the performance of GLX2TM technology which further extends the maximum time between light source gas exchanges from 1B pulses to 2B pulses, and reduces downtime associated with gas refills by a factor of 20. The stability and productivity benefits of this new technology can be realized under all light source utilization scenarios. With GLX2, the refill interval at high utilization chipmakers is 3 weeks, and 4-8 weeks at lower utilization customers. Metrics illustrating the success of each of these capabilities will be presented. The second-generation of GLX technology was launched in July 2008 after chipmakers responded favorably to GLX performance metrics.", "Deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography improvements have been focused on two paths: further increases in the effective numerical aperture (NA) beyond 1.3, and double patterning (DP). High-index solutions for increasing the effective NA have not gained significant momentum due to several technical factors, and have been eclipsed by an aggressive push to make DP a high-volume manufacturing solution. The challenge is to develop a cost-effective solution using a process that effectively doubles the lithography steps required for critical layers, while achieving a higher degree of overlay performance. As a result, the light source requirements for DP fall into 3 main categories: (a) higher power to enable higher throughput on the scanner, (b) lower operating costs to offset the increased number of process steps, and (c) high stability of optical parameters to support more stringent process requirements. The XLR 600i (6kHz, 90W @15mJ) was introduced last year to enable DP by leveraging the higher performance and lower operating costs of the ring architecture XLR 500i (6kHz, 60W @10mJ) platform currently used for 45nm immersion lithography in production around the world. In February 2009, the XLR 600ix was introduced as a 60/90W switchable product to provide flexibility in the transition to higher power requirements as scanner capabilities are enhanced. The XLR 600ix includes improved optics materials to meet reliability requirements while operating at higher internal fluences. In this paper we will illustrate the performance characteristics during extended testing. Examples of performance include polarization stability, divergence and pointing stability, which enable consistent pupil fill under extreme illumination conditions, as well as overall thermal stability which maintains constant beam performance under large changes in laser operating modes. Furthermore, the unique beam uniformity characteristics that the ring architecture generates result in lower peak energy densities that are comparable to those of a typical 60W excimer laser. In combination with the XLR's long pulse duration, this allows for long life scanner optics while operating at 15mJ.", "The time-to-market driven need to maintain concurrent process-design co-development, even in spite of discontinuous patterning, process, and device innovation is reiterated. The escalating design rule complexity resulting from increasing layout sensitivities in physical and electrical yield and the resulting risk to profitable technology scaling is reviewed. Shortcomings in traditional Design for Manufacturability (DfM) solutions are identified and contrasted to the highly successful integrated design-technology co-optimization used for SRAM and other memory arrays. The feasibility of extending memory-style design-technology co-optimization, based on a highly simplified layout environment, to logic chips is demonstrated. Layout density benefits, modeled patterning and electrical yield improvements, as well as substantially improved layout simplicity are quantified in a conventional versus template-based design comparison on a 65nm IBM PowerPC 405 microprocessor core. The adaptability of this highly regularized template-based design solution to different yield concerns and design styles is shown in the extension of this work to 32nm with an increased focus on interconnect redundancy. In closing, the work not covered in this paper, focused on the process side of the integrated process-design co-optimization, is introduced.", "Visualization at the mask plane of the effects of illumination, proximity, and defocus is used to give physical insight into restricted design rules, layout choices, and residual edge placement errors. To facilitate this work, a pattern matching code has been tuned, tested, and enhanced. The richness of the original code with complex match factors, mask Boolean operations, and mask weights and phases has been adapted to operate on clear-field attenuated-phase-shifting masks with asymmetrical illumination. To account for illumination effects, the aberration spillover is multiplied by the Fourier transform of the angular distribution of the intensity spectrum incident on the mask. In a study of binary mask layouts, the R-squared correlation of the prediction of image intensity with Pattern Match Factor increased from 0.57 to 0.89 when annular illumination was included in the spillover function. In addition, features to visualize the mutual coherence, shifts of the illumination, and source maps have been added.", "As design rules and corresponding logic standard cell layouts continue to shrink node-on-node in accordance with Moore's law, complex 2D interactions, both intra-cell and between cells, become much more prominent. For example, in lithography, lack of scaling of \u03bb/NA implies aggressive use of resolution enhancement techniques to meet logic scaling requirements-resulting in adverse effects such as 'forbidden pitches'-and also implies an increasing range of optical influence relative to cell size. These adverse effects are therefore expected to extend well beyond the cell boundary, leading to lithographic marginalities that occur only when a given cell is placed \"in context\" with other neighboring cells in a variable design environment [1]. This context dependence is greatly exacerbated by increased use of strain engineering techniques such as SiGe and dual-stress liners (DSL) to enhance transistor performance, both of which also have interaction lengths on the order of microns. The use of these techniques also breaks the formerly straightforward connection between lithographic 'shapes' and end-of-line electrical performance, thus making the formulation of design rules that are robust to process variations and complex 2D interactions more difficult. To address these issues, we have developed a first-principles-based simulation flow to study contextdependent electrical effects in layout, arising not only from lithography, but also from stress and interconnect parasitic effects. This flow is novel in that it can be applied to relatively large layout clips- required for context-dependent analysis-without relying on semi-empirical or 'black-box' models for the fundamental electrical effects. The first-principles-based approach is ideal for understanding contextdependent effects early in the design phase, so that they can be mitigated through restrictive design rules. The lithographic simulations have been discussed elsewhere [1] and will not be presented in detail. The stress calculations are based on a finite-element method, extrapolated to mobility using internal algorithms. While these types of calculations are common in '1D' TCAD space, we have modified them to handle ~10 \u03bcm X 10 \u03bcm clips in reasonable runtime based on advances in software and optimization of computing resources, structural representations and simulation grids. In this paper, we discuss development and validation of the simulation flow, and show representative results of applying this flow to analyze context-dependent problems in a 32-nm low-power CMOS process. Validation of the flow was accomplished using a well-characterized 40/45-nm CMOS process incorporating both DSL and SiGe. We demonstrate the utility of this approach not only to establishing restrictive design rules for avoiding catastrophic context-dependent effects, but also to flag individual cells and identify cell design practices that exhibit unacceptable levels of context-dependent variability. We further show how understanding the sources of stress variation is vital to appropriately anchoring SPICE models to capture the impact of context-dependent electrical effects. We corroborate these simulations with data from electrical test structures specifically targeted to elucidate these effects.", "As design rule (DR) scaling continues to push lithographic imaging to higher numerical aperture (NA) and smaller k1 factor, extensive use of resolution enhancement techniques becomes a general practice. Use of these techniques not only adds considerable complexity to the design rules themselves, but also can lead to undesired and/or unanticipated problematic imaging effects known as \"hotspots.\" This is particularly common for metal layers in interconnect patterning due to the many complex random and bidirectional (2D) patterns present in typical layout. In such situations, the validation of DR becomes challenging, and the ability to analyze large numbers of 2D layouts is paramount in generating a DR set that encodes all lithographic constraints to avoid hotspot formation. Process window (PW) and mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) are the two most important lithographic constraints in defining design rules. Traditionally, characterization of PW and MEEF by simulation has been carried out using discrete cut planes. For a complex 2D pattern or a large 2D layout, this approach is intractable, as the most likely location of the PW or MEEF hotspots often cannot be predicted empirically, and the use of large numbers of cut planes to ensure all hotspots are detected leads to excessive simulation time. In this paper, we present a novel approach to analyzing fullfield PW and MEEF using the inverse lithography technology (ILT) technique, [1] in the context of restrictive design rule development for the 32nm node. Using this technique, PW and MEEF are evaluated on every pixel within a design, thereby addressing the limitations of cut-plane approach while providing a complete view of lithographic performance. In addition, we have developed an analysis technique using color bitmaps that greatly facilitates visualization of PW and MEEF hotspots anywhere in the design and at an arbitrary level of resolution. We have employed the ILT technique to explore metal patterning options and their impact on 2D design rules. We show the utility of this technique to quickly screen specific rule and process choices-including illumination condition and process bias-using large numbers of parameterized structures. We further demonstrate how this technique can be used to ascertain the full 2D impact of these choices using carefully constructed regression suites based on standard random logic cells. The results of this study demonstrate how this simulation approach can greatly improve the accuracy and quality of 2D rules, while simultaneously accelerating learning cycles in the design phase.", "Chip performance and yield are increasingly limited by systematic and random variations introduced during wafer processing. Systematic variations are layout-dependent and can be broadly classified as optical or non-optical in nature. Optical effects have their origin in the lithography process including mask, RET, and resist. Non-optical effects are layout-dependent systematic variations which originate from processes other than lithography. Some examples of nonoptical effects are stress variations, well-proximity effect, spacer thickness variations and rapid thermal anneal (RTA) variations. Semiconductor scaling has led to an increase in the complexity and impact of such effects on circuit parameters. A novel technique for dataprep called electrically-driven optical proximity correction (ED-OPC) has been previously proposed which replaces the conventional OPC objective of minimization of edge placement error (EPE) with an electrical error related cost function. The introduction of electrical objectives into the OPC flow opens up the possibility of compensating for electrical variations which do not necessarily originate from the lithographic process. In this paper, we propose to utilize ED-OPC to compensate for optical as well as non-optical effects in order to mitigate circuit-limited variability and yield. We describe the impact of non-optical effects on circuit parameters such as threshold voltage and mobility. Given accurate models to predict variability of circuit parameters, we show how EDOPC can be leveraged to compensate circuit performance for matching designer intent. Compared to existing compensation techniques such as gate length biasing and metal fills, the primary advantage of using ED-OPC is that the process of fragmentation in OPC allows greater flexibility in tuning transistor properties. The benefits of using ED-OPC to compensate for non-optical effects can be observed in reduced guard-banding, leading to less conservative designs. In addition, results show a 4% average reduction in spread in timing in compensating for intra-die threshold voltage variability, which potentially translates to mitigation of circuit-limited yield.", "In this work we present the impact of the variations in lithography on the performance of analog circuits. Matching pairs of devices are critical in the design of many analog circuit blocks. Simple circuits, such as current mirrors and differential pairs, depend on the matching between transistors to provide accurate bias currents and symmetrical ac gains with minimal offsets. Complex analog systems, such as analog-to-digital converters and phase-locked loops, depend on the matching between different active and passive devices, such as transistors and resistors. Variations in lithography encountered during fabrication of analog circuits can lead to matching errors and hence performance and yield losses for the device. The impact of some lithographical errors, such as focus and dose errors, mask errors, and lens aberrations, on some of the key analog building blocks, namely a single transistor, a current mirror and a differential pair is presented. The errors of such cases are also explored for the ring oscillator, demonstrating the extent of performance variation on complex analog circuits.", "A novel model-based algorithm provides a capability to control full-chip design specific variation in pattern transfer caused by via/contact etch processes. This physics based algorithm is capable of detecting and reporting etch hotspots based on the fab defined thresholds of acceptable variations in critical dimension (CD) of etched shapes. It can be used also as a tool for etch process optimization to capture the impact of a variety of patterns presented in a particular design. A realistic set of process parameters employed by the developed model allows using this novel via-contact etch (VCE) EDA tool for the design aware process optimization in addition to the \"standard\" process aware design optimization.", "An interval-value based circuit simulation engine is proposed to estimate the transistor-level circuit performance distribution without Monte-Carlo simulations. In the proposed flow, variability in process variables is first casted into an interval representation; then an interval-valued circuit simulator, in which all real number operations are replaced by interval operations, is used to simulate the circuit; the interval-valued simulation results can be used to extract performance statistics. A runtime reduction over both Monte-Carlo simulation and response surface modeling has been demonstrated, while excellent accuracies in transistor-level performance statistics are maintained. Future work includes incorporating non-Gaussian distributions into the interval simulation, and adapting an interval-value based framework into a design flow suitable for statistical performance optimization.", "We have conducted a study of context-dependent variability for cells in a 45nm library, including both lithography and stress effects, using the Cadence Litho Electrical Analyzer (LEA) software. Here, we present sample data and address a number of questions that arise in such simulations. These questions include identification of stress effects causing context dependence, impact of the number of contexts on the results, and combining lithography-induced variations due to overlay error with context-dependent variations. Results of such simulations can be used to drive a number of corrective and adaptive actions, among them layout modification, cell placement restrictions, or optimal design margin determination.", "Parameter-specific and simulation-calibrated ring oscillator (RO) inverter layouts are described for identifying and quantitatively modeling sources of circuit performance variation from source/drain stress, shallow trench isolation (STI) stress, lithography, etch, and misalignment. This paper extends the RO approach by adding physical modeling/simulation of the sources of variability to tune the layouts of monitors for enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. Poly and diffusion layout choices have been guided by fast-CAD pattern matching. The accuracy of the fast-CAD estimate from the Pattern Matcher for these lithography issues is corroborated by simulations in Mentor Graphics Calibre. Generic conceptual results are given based on the experience from preparing of proprietary layouts that pass DRC check for a 45 nm test chip with ST Micro. Typical improvements in sensitivity of 2 fold are possible with layouts for lithography focus. A layout monitor for poly to diffusion misalignment based on programmable off-sets shows a 0.8% change in RO frequency per 1nm poly to diffusion off-set. Layouts are also described for characterizing stress effects associated with diffusion area size, asymmetry, vertical spacing, and multiple gate lengths.", "Scaling of integrated circuits over the past several ten years has been done successfully by improvement of photolithography equipment and resolution enhancement technique. The smaller the feature size is, the tighter controllability of critical dimension (CD) is required. Enormous efforts have been made to achieve device specifications. Especially in logic devices as system on chip, controllability of gate transistor CD is the one of the greatest concern for both designer and manufacturer since characteristics of device chip, speed and power, are largely depend on the gate CD. From the viewpoint of manufacturer all gate transistors on a chip have equivalent weight and tight CD controls are applied to them. Nevertheless, each transistor has a various weight and required controllability is definitely different from the viewpoint of chip designer. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of tolerance as representation of design intentions. An intention derived at chip designing stage is converted to a formula which is comprehensive and measurable at manufacturing1,2. Timing margin of each path, which is derived from timing analysis at chip design, can be converted to the most comprehensive formula as CD tolerance, for instance. Two major application of the tolerance deduced from design intention will be presented. The first one is reduction of OPC processing time and the second application of the tolerance is qualification at photo-mask and wafer processing. Comprehension of design intentions and interpretation of them to tolerance will be promising way for cost effective manufacturing.", "As advanced manufacturing processes become more stable, the need to adapt new designs to fully utilize the available manufacturing technology becomes a key technologic differentiator. However, many times such gains can only be realized and evaluated during full chip analysis. It has been demonstrated that the most accurate layout verification methods require application of the actual OPC recipes along with most of the mask data preparation that defines the pattern transfer characteristics of the process. Still, this method in many instances is not sufficiently fast to be used in a layout creation environment which undergoes constant updates. By doing an analysis of typical mask data processing, it is possible to determine that the most CPUintensive computations are the OPC and contour simulation steps needed to perform layout printability checks. Several researchers have tried to reduce the time it takes to compute the OPC mask by introducing matrix convolutions of the layout with empirically calibrated two-dimensional functions. However, most of these approaches do not provide a sufficient speed-up since they only replace the OPC computation and still require a full contour computation. Another alternative is to try to find effective ways of pattern matching those topologies that will exhibit transfer difficulties4, but such methods lack the ability to be predictive beyond their calibration data. In this paper we present a methodology that includes common resolution enhancement techniques, such as retargeting and sub-resolution assist feature insertion, and which replaces the OPC computation and subsequent contour calculation with an edge bias function based on an empirically-calibrated, directional, two-dimensional function. Because the edge bias function does not provide adequate control over the corner locations, a spline-based smoothing process is applied. The outcome is a piecewise-linear curve similar to those obtained by full lithographic simulations. Our results are analyzed from the point of view of runtime and matching with respect to a complete verification process that uses full mask data preparation followed by production-quality contour simulations under a variety of process variations, including perturbations to focus, mask bias and exposure. One of the main concerns with using an empirical model is its ability to predict topologies that were not part of the original calibration. While there is indeed a dependency on the model in regard to the data used for calibration, the results indicate that this dependency is weak and that such models are able to provide sufficient accuracy with much more tolerable computation times.", "An algorithm is presented which performs a model-based colouring of a given layout for double patterning. The algorithm searches the space of patterns which can be printed with a particular wavelength and numerical aperture, and seeks to find a pair of patterns which combine to produce the desired target layout. This is achieved via a cost function which encodes the geometry of the layout and allowable edge placement tolerances. If the layout is not printable by double patterning, then the algorithm provides a closest solution and indicates hotspots where the target is not feasible.", "While predicting and removing of lithographic hot-spots are a matured practice in recent semiconductor industry, it is one of the most difficult challenges to achieve high quality detection coverage and to provide designer-friendly fixing guidance for effective physical design implementation. In this paper, we present an accurate hot-spot detection method through leveling and scoring algorithm using weighted combination of image quality parameters, i.e., normalized image log-slope (NILS), mask error enhancement factor (MEEF), and depth of focus (DOF) which can be obtained through lithography simulation. Hot-spot scoring function and severity level are calibrated with process window qualification results. Least-square regression method is used to calibrate weighting coefficients for each image quality parameter. Once scoring function is obtained with wafer results, it can be applied to various designs with the same process. Using this calibrated scoring function, we generate fixing guidance and rule for the detected hot-spot area by locating edge bias value which can lead to a hot-spot free score level. Fixing guidance is generated by considering dissections information of OPC recipe. Finally, we integrated hot-spot fixing guidance display into layout editor for the effective design implementation. Applying hot-spot scoring and fixing method to memory devices of the 50nm node and below, we could achieve a sufficient process window margin for high yield mass production.", "In May 2006, the Mask Design, Drawing, and Inspection Technology Research Department (Mask D2I) at the Association of Super-Advanced Electronics Technologies (ASET) launched 4-year program for reducing mask manufacturing cost and TAT by concurrent optimization of MDP, mask writing, and mask inspection [1]. One area of the project focuses on the extraction and utilization of repeating patterns. The repeating patterns are extracted from the mask data after OPC. The information is then used in Character Projection (CP) for reducing the shot counts during the electron beam writing. In this paper we will address the verification of the efficiency in extracting repeating pattern from the actual device production data obtained from the member companies of MaskD2I, and will report on the improvement of the software tool by these results.", "Device and reliability performances of Deep Sub-Micron devices depend on the physical layout and the sensitivity of this layout to the foundry process. However, layout optimization does not necessarily means layout \"relaxation\" for all structures. A complex design needs a \"judgment\" system, which will identify the \"quality\" of each design rule and suggest locations to be modified. Another important task is to be able quantitatively compare between layouts, designed for the same purpose (standard cells for example). In this work, we propose a \"ranking\" system, which analyzes the design and prioritizes the places to be modified. Our \"ranking\" system consists of set of rules based on the wafer foundry process. Different check rules have different impact on performance and because of that they get different priorities within the final results. Based on that, the overall design score, and the rule-priority-of-improvement are calculated. We start by presenting our ranking analysis system. Afterwards, we compare several standard cells libraries, designed by leading 3rd party IP houses. Based on the ranking results, guidelines and priority for layout modification are defined. We also discuss the impact of different DRC coding methods on the scoring values. For example, checking the overlap of M1 layer over contact by measuring the enclosure or by measuring the overlap area. Finally, we show our analysis for several similar cells as well as for a full-chip design.", "In recent years, various DFM techniques are developed and adopted by the designers to improve circuit yield and reliability. The benefits from applying a DFM technique to a circuit often come at the expense of degrading other process or design attributes. In this paper, we discuss two widely deployed techniques: double vias and wire spreading/widening, show the benefits and trade-offs of their usage, and practical ways to implement them in SoC designs.", "As the process development advances to deep sub-100 nm technology, many new technologies such as immersion lithography and hyper NA lens design are developed for the improved on-wafer pattern resolution to meet the technology requirement. During the early process development such as 45 nm technology, it was not clear that lithography tool could meet stringent CD variation requirement. Many rules such as fixed poly pitch, single poly orientation, and dummy poly insertion for diffusion edge transistors were implemented [1, 2] to ensure that, with designated litho-tool, the CD variation control could be minimized. These rules generally added layout design complexity and area penalty. It would be efficient that these rules could be evaluated and properly implemented with data collected from well-design test structures. In this work, a set of simple test structures with various dummy poly gate lengths and numbers of dummy poly gates, and fix-pitch poly gate orientations were implemented in the process development test vehicles (TV's). Electrical, simulation, and in-line CD data of these test structures were collected. Analysis of the data and related design rule optimization and implementation are described. This work helped to optimize and to properly implement the 45 nm gate poly design rules during early process development for Xilinx FPGA product development.", "In this paper, we provide some data on the actual scaling of OPC runtime that we have experienced at AMD. We review the expected OPC requirements down to the 16 nm node and develop a model to predict the total CPU requirements to process a single chip design. We will also review the scalability of \"hardware acceleration\" under a variety of scenarios.", "We have constructed hotspot management flow with a die-to-database (D2DB) inspection system for spacer patterning technologies (SPTs) which are among the strongest candidates in double patterning technologies below 3x nm half-pitch generations. At SPIE 2006[1], we reported in \"Hotspot management\" that extracted hotspot by full-chip lithography simulation could be quickly fed back to OPC, mask making, etc. Since the SPT includes process complexity from resist patterning to final device patterning, however, it is difficult to exactly estimate hotspots on final patterned features on wafers by full-chip lithography simulation. Therefore, experimental full-chip inspection methodologies for hotspots extraction are necessary in order to construct hotspot management for SPTs. In this work, we applied the D2DB inspection system with electron beam (EB) to SPTs in hotspot management flow. For the D2DB inspection system, the NGR-2100 has remarkable features for the full-chip inspection within reasonable operating time. This system provides accurate hotspot extraction by EB with wider field of view (FOV) than that of SEMs. With the constructed hotspot management flow, extracted hotspots for SPT involving errors of around 10nm could easily be fed back to fix the wafer processes and mask data.", "The RET selection process, for 32 nm and 22 nm technology nodes, is becoming evermore complex due to an increase in the availability of strong resolution enhancements (e.g., polarization control, custom exotic illuminators, hyper NA). Lithographers often select the illuminator geometries based on analyzing aerial images for a limited set of structures. However, source-shape geometries optimized using this methodology is not always optimal for other complex patterns. This leads to critical hot-spots on the final wafer images in form of bridges and gaps. Lithographers would like to analyze the impact of selected source-shape on wafer results for the complex patterns before running the physical experiments. Physics based computational lithography tools allow users to predict the accurate wafer images. This approach allows users to run large factorial experiments for simple and complex designs without running physical experiments. In this study, we will analyze the lithographic performance of simple 1D patterns using aerial image models and physical resist models with calibrated resist parameters1,2,3,4 for two commercial resists. Our goal is to determine whether physical resist models yield a different optimal solution as compared to the aerial image model. We will explore several imaging parameters - like Numerical Aperture (NA), source geometries (Annular, Quadrupole, etc.), illumination configurations and anchor features for different sizes and pitches. We will apply physics based OPC and compute common process windows using physical model. In the end, we will analyze and recommend the optimal source-mask solution for given set of designs based on all the models.", "Sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) insertion using mask synthesis process based on pixel-based mask optimization schemes has been studied in recent years for various lithographical schemes, including 6% attenuated PSM (AttPSM) with off-axis illumination. This paper presents results of application of the pixelbased optimization technology to 6% and 30% AttPSM mask synthesis. We examine imaging properties of mask error enhancement factor (MEEF), critical dimension (CD) uniformity, and side-lobe printing for random contact hole patterns. We also discuss practical techniques for manipulating raw complex shapes generated by the pixel-based optimization engine that ensure mask manufacturability.", "The importance of Line Edge Roughness (LER) and Line Width Roughness (LWR) has long surpassed its effect on process control. As devices scale down, the roughness effects have become a major hindrance for further advancement along Moore's law. Many studies have been conducted over the years on the sensitivity of LER to various changes in the materials and the process, which have been considered the main way to tackle the problem - especially through Photoresist improvement. However, despite the increased development of DFM tools in recent years, limited research was done as to LER sensitivity to layout, and the research that was done was limited to proximity effects. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of LER to the layout around the transistor, defined by the gate structure of poly over AA (Active Area). Using different types and geometries of transistors, we found that the poly-gate LER is sensitive to the structure of the Active Area around it (source/drain from gate to contact, both shape and length). Using local LER measurement (moving standard deviation of poly edge location), we found a clear correlation between LER value and the length of the AA/STI boundary located at a close range. Longer AA edges yield higher LER, as proved by comparing gate LER of dog-bone transistor with classical transistor. Based on these results, we suggest that LER is sensitive not only to proximity effects, but also to the layout of underlying layers, through the effect of light scattering of the edges during the lithographic process.", "As semiconductor technologies move toward 70nm generation and below, contact-hole is one of the most challenging features to print on wafer. There are two principle difficulties in defining small contact-hole patterns on wafer. One is insufficient process margin besides poor resolution compared with line-space pattern. The other is that contact-hole should be made through pitches and random contact-hole pattern should be fabricated from time to time. PIXBAR technology is the candidate which can help improve the process margin for random contact-holes. The PIXBAR technology lithography attempts to synthesize the input mask which leads to the desired output wafer pattern by inverting the forward model from mask to wafer. This paper will use the pixel-based mask representation, a continuous function formulation, and gradient-based interactive optimization techniques to solve the problem. The result of PIXBAR method helps gain improvement in process window with a short learning cycle in contact-hole pattern assist-feature testing.", "In this work, we present a novel application of layout printability verification (LPV) to assess the scalability of physical layout components from 32 nm to 28 and 22 nm with respect to process variability metrics. Starting from the description of a mature LPV flow, the paper illustrates the core methodology for deriving a metric for design scalability. The functional dependency between the scalability metric and the scaling factor can then be modeled to study the scaling robustness of a set of representative layouts. Conversely, quantitative data on scalability limits can be used to determine which design rules can be pushed and which must be relaxed in the transition from 32 to 22 nm.", "A compact model for estimating delay variations due to double patterning lithography process variations on interconnect layers is presented. Through process simulation and circuit analysis of one-dimensional interconnect topologies, the delay response from focus, exposure, and overlay is studied. Using a process window defined by 10% linewidth change from focus and exposure, and \u00b110% overlay error, a worst case change in delay of 3.9% is observed for an optimal buffer circuit. It is shown that such delay responses can be modeled using a second order polynomial function of process parameters. The impact of multiple interconnect variations in unique layout environments is studied using multiple segments of interconnects each experiencing different variations. The overall delay responses are then examined, and it is shown that for these layout structures, the separate variations combine in a manner that is both additive and subtractive, thereby reducing the overall delay variations.", "In double patterning lithography (DPL), overlay error between two patterning steps at the same layer translates into CD variability. Since CD uniformity budget is very tight, overlay control becomes a tough challenge for DPL. In this paper, we electrically evaluate overlay error for BEOL DPL with the goal of studying relative effects of different overlay sources and interactions of overlay control with design parameters. Experimental results show the following: (a) overlay electrical impact is not significant in case of positive-tone DPL (< 3.4% average capacitance variation) and should be the base for determining overlay budget requirement; (b) when considering congestion, overlay electrical impact reduces in positivetone DPL; (c) Design For Manufacturability (DFM) techniques like wire spreading can have a large effect on overlay electrical impact (20% increase of spacing can reduce capacitance variation by 22%); (d) translation overlay has the largest electrical impact compared to other overlay sources; and (e) overlay in y direction (x for horizontal metalization) has negligible electrical impact and, therefore, preferred routing direction should be taken into account for overlay sampling and alignment strategies.", "Advances in lithography patterning have been the primary driving force in microelectronics manufacturing processes. With the increasing gap between the wavelength of the optical source and feature sizes, the accompanying strong diffraction effects have a significant impact on the pattern fidelity of on-silicon layout shapes. Layout patterns become highly sensitive to those context shapes lying within the optical radius of influence. Under such optical proximity effects, manufacturability hot spots such as necking and bridging may occur. Studies have shown that manufacturability hot spots are pattern dependent in nature and should be considered at the design stage [1]. It is desirable to detect these hot spots as early as possible in the design flow to minimize the costs for correction. In this work, we propose a hot spot prediction method based on a support vector machine technique. Given the location of a hot spot candidate and its context patterns, the proposed method is capable of efficiently predicting whether a candidate would become a hot spot. It takes just seconds to classify thousands of samples. Due to its computational efficiency, it is possible to use this method in physical design tools to rapidly assess the quality of printed patterns. We demonstrate one such application in which we evaluate the layout quality in the boundary region of standard cells. In the conventional standard cell layout optimization process, lithography simulation is the main layout verification method. Since it is a very time-consuming process, the iterative optimization approach between simulation and layout correction [2] takes a long time and only a limited number of context patterns can be explored. We show that with the proposed hot spot prediction method, for each standard cell, a much greater context pattern space can be explored, and the context sensitivity of a hot spot candidate located near a cell boundary can be estimated.", "This paper provides details of the implementation of a new design hotspot classification and detection system, and presents results of using the system to detect hotspots in layouts. A large set of hotspot snippets is grouped into a small number of clusters containing geometrically similar hotspots. A fast incremental clustering algorithm is used to perform this task efficiently on very large datasets. Each cluster is analyzed to produce a characterization of a class of hotspots, and a pattern matcher is used to detect hotspots in new design layouts based on the hotspot class descriptions.", "As technology processes continue to shrink and aggressive resolution enhancement technologies (RET) and optical proximity correction (OPC) are applied, standard design rule constraints (DRC) sometimes fails to fully capture the concept of design manufacturability. DRC Plus augments standard DRC by applying fast 2D pattern matching to design layout to identify problematic 2D patterns missed by DRC. DRC Plus offers several advantages over other DFM techniques: it offers a simple pass/no-pass criterion, it is simple to document as part of the design manual, it does not require compute intensive simulations, and it does not require highly-accurate lithographic models. These advantages allow DRC Plus to be inserted early in the design flow, and enforced in conjunction with standard DRC. The creation of DRC Plus rules, however, remains a challenge. Hotspots derived from lithographic simulation may be used to create DRC Plus rules, but the process of translating a hotspot into a pattern is a difficult and manual effort. In this paper, we present an algorithmic methodology to identify hot patterns using lithographic simulation rather than hotspots. First, a complete set of pattern classes, which covers the entire design space of a sample layout, is computed. These pattern classes, by construction, can be directly used as DRC Plus rules. Next, the manufacturability of each pattern class is evaluated as a whole. This results in a quantifiable metric for both design impact and manufacturability, which can be used to select individual pattern classes as DRC Plus rules. Simulation experiment shows that hundreds of rules can be created using this methodology, which is well beyond what is possible by hand. Selective visual inspection shows that algorithmically generated rules are quite reasonable. In addition to producing DRC Plus rules, this methodology also provides a concrete understanding of design style, design variability, and how they affect manufacturability.", "As the transistors are scaled down, undesirable performance mismatch in identically designed transistors increases and hence causes greater impact on circuit performance and yield. Since Line-End Roughness (LER) has been reported to be in the order of several nanometers and not to decrease as the device shrinks, it has evolved as a critical problem in the sub-45nm devices and may lead to serious device parameter fluctuations and performance limitation for the future VLSI circuit application. Although LER is a kind of random variation, it is undesirable and has to be analyzed because it causes the device to fluctuate. In this paper, we present a new cell characterization methodology which uses the non-rectangular gate print-images generated by lithography and etch simulations with the random LER variation to estimate the device performance of a sub-45nm design. The physics based TCAD simulation tool is used for validating the accuracy of our LER model. We systematically analyze the random LER by taking the impact on circuit performance due to LER variation into consideration and suggest the maximum tolerance of LER to minimize the performance degradation. We observed that the driving current is highly affected by LER as the gate length becomes thinner. We performed lithography simulations using 45nm process window to examine the LER impact of the state-of-the-art industrial devices. Results show that the rms value of LER is as much as 10% from its nominal line edge, and the saturation current can vary by as much as 10% in our 2-input NAND cell.", "A methodology for predicting on and off-state transistor performance is described in this paper. In general, this flow consists of systematic Edge-Contour-Extraction (ECE) from devices under the manufacturing, followed by device simulation. Gate parameter extraction calculates an equivalent gate length and width (Leq, Weq) for non-rectangular gates. The methodology requires a model describing MOSFET behavior of current versus width for various gate lengths and voltages. Non-rectangular gates are described by a weighted sum of the currents from a discrete representation (i.e. Total gate current is determined by a weighted sum since the current distribution is not homogeneous along the channel). Thus, for a given L, W and V, the current should be discoverable from the calibrated model. This approach is more general than previous work as both Leq and Weq are determined for a given voltage which permits the model to predict on and off-current with a single spice netlist as opposed to previous work which only considered adjustments to the channel length. In this work, two transistor series at two different drawn pitch conditions (dense and isolated) were manufactured, followed by state-of-the-art ECE. The contours obtained directly by SEM measurements were used to perform an electrical device simulation for each individual transistor in the series. This paper demonstrates the possibility to analyze the transistor's electrical performance at nominal and off-process conditions. The presented simulation flow provides the advantage of early-in-time prediction of the transistor performances, measuring large volume of devices in a fast and accurate fashion.", "A circuit-topology-driven approach to Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is presented. By tailoring device critical dimension (CD) statistical distribution to the device function in the circuit, and ensuring that the CD distribution stays within the correct (possibly variable) limits during process maturation and other process changes, it can be an effective tool for optimizing circuit's performance/yield tradeoff in high-volume manufacturing. Calibre's proprietary Programmable Electrical Rule Checks (PERC) module is used to recognize the topology. Alternatively, an external static timing tool can be used to identify critical devices.", "Rigorous 3D process and device simulation has been applied to transistors with curved channel shapes that are inevitable due to the optical proximity effects. The impact of channel curvature on the transistor performance has been benchmarked using the universal Ion/Ioff coordinates. Systematic study of the different non-rectangular channel shapes included straight lines at an angle different than 90 degrees and concave and convex shapes with different curvature radii. The study reveals that any deviation from the ideal rectangular shape affects transistor performance. The amount of enhancement or degradation depends on particular shape, with on current, threshold voltage, and off current responding very differently to the same shape variation. The type and amount of performance variation is very different for the distorted channel length (i.e. poly gate shape) vs distorted channel width (i.e. active layer shape). Degradation of over 50% in the on current at a fixed off current has been observed in the most unfavorable cases for each of the two critical mask layers. On the other hand, a desirable over 3x off current reduction at a fixed on current can be achieved by selecting a beneficial channel shape.", "At the 40nm technology node, lithographic effects have a significant impact on the electrical characteristics of CMOS transistors, which directly affects the performance of circuits containing these devices. Many of these effects are systematic and intra-cell, and can therefore be accurately modeled by accounting for layout proximity effects during cell characterization. However, because the final cell placement for real designs is not known at the time of characterization, inter-cell proximity variations cannot be treated systematically at that time. We present a method to analyze inter-cell proximity variation statistically, and approximate the effect of context as a random variable during full chip verification. We then show an example analysis applied to standard logic cells in a 40nm technology.", "The Sidewall Spacer Double Patterning (SSDP) technique, also referred to as Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP), has been adopted as the primary double patterning solution for 32nm technology nodes and below for flash memory manufacturing. Many are now looking to migrate the technique to DRAM and random Logic layers. However, DRAM and especially Logic have far more complex layout requirements than NAND-FLASH, requiring a more sophisticated use of the SSDP technique. To handle the additional complexities an automated electronic design tool was used to calculate optimal layout splits of a design target into 2 or 3 masks. The model was programmed with immersion lithography and dry-193nm lithography MRC input rules and on wafer performance was tested. We discuss the patterning needs from the trim-mask and the pad-mask and associated lithography process window requirements and alignment accuracies necessary to pursue 32nm and 22nm half-pitch designs.", "We developed a new contouring technology that executes contour re-alignment based on a matching of the measured contour with the design data. By this 'secondary' pattern matching (the 'primary' being the pattern recognitions that is done by the SEM during the measurement itself), rotation errors and XY shifts are eliminated, placing the measured contour at the correct position in the design coordinates system. In the next phase, the developed method can generate an averaged contour from multiple SEM images of identical structures, or from plural contours that are aligned accurately by the algorithm we developed. When the developed contouring technology is compared with the conventional one, it minimizes contouring errors and pattern roughness effects to the minimum and enables contouring that represents the contour across the wafer. The Contour that represents the contour across the wafer we call \"Measurement Based Averaged Contour\" or MBAC. We will show that an OPC model that is built from these MBACs is more robust than an OPC model built from contours that did not get this additional re-alignment.", "When the VLSI technology scales down to sub 40nm process node, the application of EUV is still far from reality, which forces 193nm ArF light source to be used at 32nm/22nm node. This large gap causes severe light refraction and hence reliable printing becomes a huge challenge. Various resolution enhancement technologies (RETs) have been introduced in order to solve this manufacturability problem, but facing the continuously shrinking VLSI feature size, RETs will not be able to conquer the difficulties by themselves. Since layout patterns also have a strong relationship with their own printability, therefore litho-friendly design methodology with process concern becomes necessary. In the very near future, double patterning technology (DPT) will be needed in the 32nm/22nm node, and this new process will bring major change to the circuit design phases for sure. In this paper, we try to solve the printability problem at the cell design level. Instead of the conventional 2-D structure of the standard cell, we analyze the trend of the application of 1-D cell based on three emerging double patterning technologies. Focusing on the dense line printing technology with off-axis illumination, line-end gap distribution is studied to guide our methodology for optimal cell design.", "Due to the corner rounding effect in litho process, it is hard to make the wafer image as sharp as the drawn layout near two-dimensional pattern in IC design1, 2. The inevitable gap between the design and the wafer image make the two-dimensional pattern correction complex and sensitive to the OPC correction recipe. However, there are lots of different two-dimensional patterns, for example, concave corner, convex corner, jog, line-end and space-end. Especially for Metal layer, there are lots of jogs are created by the rule-based OPC. So OPC recipe developers have to spend lots to efforts to handle different two-dimensional fragment with their own experience. In this paper, a general method is proposed to simplify the correction of two-dimensional structures. The design is firstly smoothed and then simulation sites are move from the drawn layer to this new layer. It means that the smoothed layer is used as OPC target instead of the drawn Manhattan pattern. Using this method, the OPC recipe tuning becomes easier. In addition, the convergence of two-dimensional pattern is also improved thus the runtime is reduced.", "Rule-based fragmentation has been used for many years in Optical Proximity Correction (OPC). It breaks the edge of polygons into small pieces according to the pre-defined rule based on the topography and context before model-based OPC. Although it works well in most case, it can not place the fragment point onto the proper position which decided by inherent Optical and process requirement sometimes. In this paper, an adaptive fragmentation is proposed. The polygon is first dissected according to the traditional rule. In the following iteration, the edge is re-fragmented, in which some fragments are deleted and some new fragments are created, according to their image properties. Using this method, the dissection point can be placed in the right position. It can improve the correction accuracy and eliminate the unwanted fragment at the same time.", "As the semiconductor industry moves to the 45nm node and beyond, the tolerable lithography process window significantly shrinks due to the combined use of high NA and low k1 factor. This is exacerbated by the fact that the usable depth of focus at 45nm node for critical layer is 200nm or less. Traditional Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) only computes the optimal pattern layout to optimize its lithography patterning at nominal process condition (nominal defocus and nominal exposure dose) according to an OPC model calibrated at this nominal condition, and this may put the post-OPC layout at non-negligible patterning failure risk due to the inevitable process variation (mainly defocus and dose variations). With a little sacrifice at the nominal condition, process variation aware OPC can greatly enhance the robustness of post-OPC layout patterning in the presence of defocus and dose variation. There is also an increasing demand for through process window lithography verification for post-OPC circuit layout. The corner stone for successful process variation aware OPC and lithography verification is an accurately calibrated continuous process window model which is a continuous function of defocus and dose. This calibrated model needs to be able to interpolate and extrapolate in the usable process window. Based on Synopsys' OPC modeling software package-ProGen and ProGenPlus, we developed an automated process window (PW) modeling module, which can build process variation aware process window OPC model with continuously adjustable process parameters: defocus and dose. The calibration of this continuous PW model was performed in a single calibration process using silicon measurement at nominal condition and off-focus-off-dose conditions. Through the example of several process window models for layers at 45nm technology nodes, we demonstrated that this novel continuous PW modeling approach can achieve very good performance both at nominal condition and at interpolated or extrapolated off-focus-off-dose conditions.", "Double Patterning is seen as the prime technology to keep Moore's law on path while EUV technology is still maturing into production worthiness. As previously seen for alternating-Phase Shift Mask technology[1], layout compliance of double patterning is not trivial [2,3] and blind shrinks of anything but the most simplistic existing layouts, will not be directly suitable for double patterning. Evaluating a production worthy double patterning engine with highly non-compliant layouts would put unrealistic expectations on that engine and provide metrics with poor applicability for eventual large designs. The true production use-case would be for designs that have at least some significant double patterning compliance already enforced at the design stage. With this in mind a set of ASIC design blocks of different sizes and complexities were created that were double patterning compliant. To achieve this, a set of standard cells were generated, which individually and in isolation were double patterning compliant, for multiple layers simultaneously. This was done using the automated Standard Cell creation tool CadabraTM [4]. To create a full ASIC, however, additional constraints were added to make sure compliance would not be broken across the boundaries between standard cells when placed next to each other [5]. These standard cells were then used to create a variety of double patterning compliant ASICs using iCCompilerTM to place the cells correctly. Now with a compliant layout, checks were made to see if the constraints made at the micro level really do ensure a fully compliant layout on the whole chip and if the coloring engine could cope with such large datasets. A production worthy double patterning engine is ideally distributable over multiple processors [6,7] so that fast turn-around time can be achievable on even the largest designs. We demonstrate the degree of linearity of scaling achievable with our double patterning engine. These results can be understood together with metrics such as the distribution of the sizes of networks requiring coloring resulting from these designs.", "Overlay performance and control requirements have become crucial for achieving high yield and reducing rework process. Increasing discrepancy between hardware solutions and overlay requirements, especially in sub-40nm dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices, motivates us to study process budgeting techniques and reasonable validation methods. In this paper, we introduce a SMEM (Statistical process Margin Estimation Method) to design the DRAM cell architecture which considers critical dimension (CD) and overlay variations in the perspectives of both cell architecture and manufacturability. We also proposed the method to determine overlay specifications. Using the methodologies, we obtained successfully optimized sub-40 DRAM cells which accurately estimated process tolerances and determined overlay specifications for all layers.", "Automatic layout optimization is becoming an important component of the DfM work flow, as the number of recommended rules and the increasing complexity of trade-offs between them makes manual optimization increasingly difficult and time-consuming. Automation is rapidly becoming the best consistent way to get quantifiable DfM improvements, with their inherent yield and performance benefits for standard cells and memory blocks. Takumi autofixer optimization of Common Platform layouts resulted in improved parametric tolerance and improved DfM metrics, while the cell architecture (size and routability) and the electrical characteristics (speed/power) of the layouts remained intact. Optimization was performed on both GDS-style layouts for standard cells, and on CDBA (Cadence Data Base Architecture)-style layout for memory blocks. This paper will show how trade-offs between various DfM requirements (CAA, recommended rules, and litho) were implemented, and how optimization for memories generated by a compiler was accomplished. Results from this optimization work were verified on 45nm design by model and rule based DfM checking and by wafer yields.", "We have developed a highly integrated method of mask and silicon metrology. The method adopts a metrology management system based on DBM (Design Based Metrology). This is the high accurate contouring created by an edge detection algorithm used in mask CD-SEM and silicon CD-SEM. We have inspected the high accuracy, stability and reproducibility in the experiments of integration. The accuracy is comparable with that of the mask and silicon CD-SEM metrology. In this report, we introduce the experimental results and the application. As shrinkage of design rule for semiconductor device advances, OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) goes aggressively dense in RET (Resolution Enhancement Technology). However, from the view point of DFM (Design for Manufacturability), the cost of data process for advanced MDP (Mask Data Preparation) and mask producing is a problem. Such trade-off between RET and mask producing is a big issue in semiconductor market especially in mask business. Seeing silicon device production process, information sharing is not completely organized between design section and production section. Design data created with OPC and MDP should be linked to process control on production. But design data and process control data are optimized independently. Thus, we provided a solution of DFM: advanced integration of mask metrology and silicon metrology. The system we propose here is composed of followings. 1) Design based recipe creation: Specify patterns on the design data for metrology. This step is fully automated since they are interfaced with hot spot coordinate information detected by various verification methods. 2) Design based image acquisition: Acquire the images of mask and silicon automatically by a recipe based on the pattern design of CD-SEM.It is a robust automated step because a wide range of design data is used for the image acquisition. 3) Contour profiling and GDS data generation: An image profiling process is applied to the acquired image based on the profiling method of the field proven CD metrology algorithm. The detected edges are then converted to GDSII format, which is a standard format for a design data, and utilized for various DFM systems such as simulation. Namely, by integrating pattern shapes of mask and silicon formed during a manufacturing process into GDSII format, it makes it possible to bridge highly accurate pattern profile information over to the design field of various EDA systems. These are fully integrated into design data and automated. Bi-directional cross probing between mask data and process control data is allowed by linking them. This method is a solution for total optimization that covers Design, MDP, mask production and silicon device producing. This method therefore is regarded as a strategic DFM approach in the semiconductor metrology.", "In state of the art integrated circuit industry for transistors gate length of 45nm and beyond, the sharp distinction between design and fabrication phases is becoming inadequate for fast product development. Lithographical information along with design rules has to be passed from foundries to designers, as these effects have to be taken into consideration during the design stage to insure a Lithographically Friendly Design, which in turn demands new communication channels between designers and foundries to provide the needed litho information. In the case of fabless design houses this requirement is faced with some problems like incompatible EDA platforms at both ends, and confidential information that can not be revealed by the foundry back to the design house. In this paper we propose a framework in which we will try to demonstrate a systematic approach to match any lithographical OPC solution from different EDA vendors into CalibreTM. The goal is to export how the design will look on wafer from the foundry to the designers without saying how, or requiring installation of same EDA tools. In the developed framework, we will demonstrate the flow used to match all steps used in developing OPC starting from the lithography modeling and going through the OPC recipe. This is done by the use of automated scripts that characterizes the existing OPC foundry solution, and identifies compatible counter parts in the CalibreTM domain to generate an encrypted package that can be used at the designers' side. Finally the framework will be verified using a developed test case.", "During the deep sub-micron semiconductor manufacturing process, the Chemical-Mechanical Polishing (CMP) is applied on conductor layers to create a planar surface over the wafer. To ensure layer uniformity after CMP and to avoid metal dishing and erosion effects, dummy metals are usually inserted to the layers either by designers or foundries. However, adding dummy metal polygons can have undesirable impact to the capacitance and hence the timings of the clock paths and signal paths in the design. Chartered and Magma jointly developed and validated a methodology combining the router timing-aware track fill followed by foundry metal fill to minimize the timing impact of the metal fill to the design as well as achieving high quality copper uniformity. In this paper, we will show the proposed metal fill methodology outperform the conventional approaches of metal fill or track fill. The proposed metal fill was validated using Static Timing Analysis and an accurate silicon calibrated CMP model is used for copper (Cu) thickness distributions comparisons. From the 65nm case study results, the timing impact to the design in terms of total number of nets with slack degradation has been reduced from 4% to 0.24%. And the copper uniformity in terms of standard deviation of the copper density has been improved from 0.192 to 0.142 on average. The deployment of proposed metal fill is integrated seamlessly into the reference design flow.", "One of the critical challenges facing lithographers is how to optimize the numerical aperture (NA) and illumination source intensity and polarization distribution to deliver the maximum process window for a given design in manufacturing. While the maximum NA has topped out at 1.35, the available illuminator options continue to increase, including the eventual possibility of dynamically programmable pixelized illumination to deliver nearly any imaginable source shape profile. New approaches to leverage this capability and simultaneously optimize the source and mask shapes (SMO) on a per-design basis are actively being developed. Even with the available \"standard\" illumination source primitive shapes, however, there exist a huge range of possible choices available to the lithographer. In addition, there are multiple conceivable cost functions which could be considered when determining which illumination to utilize for a specified technology and mask layer. These are related to the primary lithographic variables of exposure dose, focus, and mask size, and include depth of focus (DOF), exposure latitude (EL), normalized image log slope (NILS), image contrast, and mask error enhancement factor (MEEF). The net result can be a very large quantity of simulation data which can prove difficult to assess, and often manifest different extrema, depending upon which cost function is emphasized. We report here on the use of several analysis methods, including process variability bands, as convenient metrics to optimize full-chip post-OPC CD control in conjunction with illumination optimization tooling. The result is a more thorough and versatile statistical analysis capability than what has traditionally been possible with a CD cutline approach. The method is analogous to conventional process window CD plots used in lithography for many years.", "Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) has been used in the manufacturing process for copper (Cu) damascene process. It is well known that dishing and erosion occur during CMP process, and they strongly depend on metal density and line width. The inherent thickness and topography variations become an increasing concern for today's designs running through advanced process nodes (sub 65nm). Excessive thickness and topography variations can have major impacts on chip yield and performance; as such they need to be accounted for during the design stage. In this paper, we will demonstrate an accurate physics based CMP model and its application for CMP-related hotspot detection. Model based checking capability is most useful to identify highly environment sensitive layouts that are prone to early process window limitation and hence failure. Model based checking as opposed to rule based checking can identify more accurately the weak points in a design and enable designers to provide improved layout for the areas with highest leverage for manufacturability improvement. Further, CMP modeling has the ability to provide information on interlevel effects such as copper puddling from underlying topography that cannot be captured in Design-for- Manufacturing (DfM) recommended rules. The model has been calibrated against the silicon produced with the 45nm process from Common Platform (IBMChartered- Samsung) technology. It is one of the earliest 45nm CMP models available today. We will show that the CMP-related hotspots can often occur around the spaces between analog macros and digital blocks in the SoC designs. With the help of the CMP model-based prediction, the design, the dummy fill or the placement of the blocks can be modified to improve planarity and eliminate CMP-related hotspots. The CMP model can be used to pass design recommendations to designers to improve chip yield and performance.", "To provide fabless designers the same advantage as Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDMs), a design-oriented litho model has been calibrated and an automated lithography (litho) hotspot detection and fixing flow has been implemented during final routing optimization. This paper shows how a design-oriented litho model was built and used to automate a litho hotspot fixing design flow. The model, calibrated and validated against post-OPC contour data at 99%, was embedded into a Litho Physical Analyzer (LPA) tech file. It allowed the litho contour of drawn layouts to be simulated at full chip level to detect litho hotspots and to provide fixing guidelines. Automated hotspots fixing was hence made possible by feeding the guidelines to the fixing tools in an industry based integrated flow. Post-fixing incremental checks were also performed to converge to a clean design.", "Rapid-thermal annealing (RTA) is widely used in scaled CMOS fabrication in order to achieve ultra-shallow junction. However, recent results report systematic threshold voltage (Vth) change and increased device variation due to the RTA process [1][2]. The amount of such changes further depends on layout pattern density. In this work, a suite of thermal/TCAD simulation and compact models to accurately predict the change of transistor parameters is developed. The modeling results are validated with published silicon data, improving design predictability with advanced manufacturing process.", "Nanoimprint lithography is one of the candidates for NGL. Recently, the \"S-FIL TM\" (Step and Flash Imprint Lithography) has been developed by MII (Molecular Imprints, Inc.). Accordingly, it is necessary to build next-generation devices and study unit processes without delay. Because of good resolution, CD uniformity and LER, nanoimprint lithography is attractive. However, nanoimprint lithography (S-FIL) involves risks. In order to judge whether the S-FIL is applicable to the study of unit processes and test device fabrication, we had studied the feasibility of S-FIL technology. As a result of previous work, we obtained the results of basic evaluation and confirmed the applicability of nanoimprint lithography for unit process study and basic test device fabrication. However, application of nanoimprint lithography to various test devices requires the template resolution of 22nmHP, OL accuracy on multilayer resist, and defect density for various patterns. Therefore, in order to judge whether the S-FIL application is extendable to various test devices, we studied the characteristics of S-FIL. As a result of this work, we confirmed that the nanoimprint application is extendable to fabrication of various test devices. And as a result of basic evaluation, improvement of template resolution is confirmed and the value of 22nmHP is obtained. We confirmed the robustness of the alignment process. The defect density is related in pattern density and spread time. Thus, reduced DD without throughput loss is required.", "Imprint lithography has been included on the ITRS Lithography Roadmap at the 32, 22 and 16 nm nodes. Step and Flash Imprint Lithography (S-FIL (R)) is a unique patterning method that has been designed from the beginning to enable precise overlay to enable multilevel device fabrication. A photocurable low viscosity resist is dispensed dropwise to match the pattern density requirements of the device, thus enabling patterning with a uniform residual layer thickness across a field and across multiple wafers. Further, S-FIL provides sub-50 nm feature resolution without the significant expense of multi-element projection optics or advanced illumination sources. However, since the technology is 1X, it is critical to address the infrastructure associated with the fabrication of imprint masks (templates). For sub-32 nm device manufacturing, one of the major technical challenges remains the fabrication of full-field 1x imprint masks with commercially viable write times. Recent progress in the writing of sub-40 nm patterns using commercial variable shape e-beam tools and non-chemically amplified resists has demonstrated a very promising route to realizing these objectives, and in doing so, has considerably strengthened imprint lithography as a competitive manufacturing technology for the sub-32nm node. Here we report the first imprinting results from sub-40 nm full-field patterns, using Samsung's current flash memory production device design. The fabrication of the imprint mask and the resulting critical dimension control and uniformity are discussed, along with image placement results. The imprinting results are described in terms of CD uniformity, etch results, and overlay.", "An integrated circuit combining imprinted, nanoscale crossbar switches with metal-oxide field effect transistors (MOSFET) was fabricated and tested. Construction of the circuits began with fabrication of n-channel MOSFET devices on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates using CMOS compatible process techniques. To protect the FET devices as well as provide a flat surface for subsequent nanoimprint lithography, passivation and planarization layers were deposited. Crossbar junctions were then fabricated next to the FETs using imprint lithography to first define arrays of parallel nanowires over which, a switchable material layer was deposited. This was followed by a second imprint proces to construct another set of parallel wires on top of, and orthogonal to the first, to complete the nano-crossbar array with a half pitch (hp) of 50 nm. The switchable crossbar devices were then connected to the gate of the FETs and the resulting integrated circuit was tested using the FET as the output signal follower. This successful fabrication process serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration and a platform for advanced CMOS/nanoscale crossbar hybrid logic circuits.", "Imprint lithography achieves high resolution patterning with low roughness by avoiding the tradeoff between pattern quality and process throughput - a tradeoff that limits the capability of photolithography with chemically amplified resists. This work demonstrates the use of ZEP520A electron-beam resist for fabrication of imprint masks (templates). It is shown that high resolution, low roughness patterns can be robustly transferred from imprint mask to imprint resist, and from imprint resist through etch transfer into the underlying substrate. Through improvements to the electron-beam patterning process, 22 nm half-pitch patterns are routinely achieved with linewidth roughness (LWR) of just 2.6 nm, 3\u03c3", "UV-curable nanoimprint resist characteristics and performance are key to controlling resist-related defects formed during template removal due to cohesive failure and strong resist-template adhesion. The debonding process is governed by both the chemical bonds that form between the template and the resist during cure, and by the structure of the resist itself which determines its elastic-plastic response under load. To gain insight to contributions from resist composition to the debonding process we examine the connection between mechanical and chemical properties of a family of methacrylate polyfunctionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (mPSS) containing resists to their adhesion to fluoroalkyl silane release layers. We also survey debonding of one of the mPSS formulations, an acrylate formulation and a vinyl ether formulation from as series of metal oxide and metal nitride release layers. The results show that while intrinsic storage modulus of a cured material is important, interfacial segregation of reactants in fluid resists can influence adhesive properties as well. The metal-containing release layers are shown to have generally much lower adhesion to cured resists than does a fluoroalkyl silane release layer. They present a useful alternative for template release treatments.", "Step and Flash Imprint Lithography (S-FIL\u00ae) in conjunction with Sacrificial Imprint Materials (SIM) shows promise as a cost effective solution to patterning sub 45nm features and is capable of simultaneously patterning two levels of interconnect structures, which provides a high throughput and low cost BEOL process. This paper describes the integration of S-FIL into an industry standard Cu/low-k dual damascene process that is being practiced in the ATDF at Sematech in Austin. The pattern transferring reactive ion etching (RIE) process is the most critical step and was extensively explored in this study. In addition to successful process development, the results provide useful insight into the optimal design of multilevel templates which must take into account the characteristics of both the imaging material and the dielectric layer. The template used in this study incorporates both the via and trench levels of an M2 (Metal 2) test vehicle that incorporates via chains with varying via dimensions, Kelvin test structures, serpentines, etc. The smallest vias on the template are 120nm vias with an aspect ratio of 2.0 and the smallest dense lines are 125nm/175nm with an aspect ratio of 2.9. Two inter-level dielectrics (ILD), Coral\u00ae and Black Diamond\u00ae were studied. No trench etch stop was incorporated in the ILD film stack. A multi-step, in-situ etching scheme was developed that achieves faithful pattern transfer from the sacrificial imprint material (SIM) into the underlying low k ILD with surprisingly wide process latitude. This multi-step scheme includes the following etch steps: a residual layer open, a via etch, a trench descum, a trench etch, and an SIM removal ash. Among these steps, the trench etch was found to be the most challenging to develop and it holds the key to producing high aspect ratio dual damascene features. An etching chemistry based on two fluorocarbon gases, CF4 and C4F8, was found to be very effective in delivering the desired etch profiles with optimal sidewall angle, minimal facet formation. The optimized etch process can be exploited to provide substantial size reduction and/or increased aspect ratio relative to the template. In this way structures with final critical dimensions of 95nm in vias with aspect ratio of 3.0 and 67nm/233nm in dense lines with aspect ratio of 3.6 were demonstrated with wide process latitude. This enables manufacturing of the template at larger dimensions, which simplifies both fabrication and inspection. The successful development of the dual damascene RIE process at the second metal (M2) level was demonstrated in a mixed and matched build with an ATDF standard first layer metal (M1) process. The M1 dielectric was TEOS and was patterned by 248nm lithography. The M2 and Via levels used Coral as ILD and both levels were patterned simultaneously by S-FIL using Molecular Imprint Imprio 55 and Imprio 100 imprint tools. This electrical test vehicle provided solid evidence that S-FIL is fully compatible with industry standard dual damascene process.", "A dual damascene template fabrication process has been developed, which enables the structuring of high-resolution, high-aspect pillars on top of lines. Based on this technology templates with three different designs have been fabricated and characterized. Two templates are dedicated for an assessment of the fabrication process using a regular test design on one hand and an arbitrary CMOS design on the other hand. With the third template via chains shall be later realized as demonstrator for electrical tests. The templates have been imprinted in resist and sacrificial material on an Imprio 55 and an Imprio 100 tool. The usability of each fabricated template could be confirmed for the specific application. For the template manufacturing a Vistec variable shape e-beam (VSB) writer SB352HR and appropriate positive-tone and negative-tone chemically amplified resists (CAR) have been used.", "The step and flash imprint lithography (SFIL) process requires the clean separation of a quartz template from a polymer imprint, and the force required to create this separation must be minimized to prevent the generation of defects. According to fracture mechanics principles, decreasing both the imprint polymer modulus and the interfacial fracture energy are beneficial for reducing the separation force. Adjusting the crosslinker concentration in the imprint formulation decreases the modulus but does not significantly impact the facture energy. On the other hand, fluorinated surfactant additives to the imprint fluid lower the modulus of the imprint polymer and decrease the fracture energy. The fracture energy is further decreased by using a nonreactive, liquid surfactant versus a surfactant that reacts with the polymer matrix. Angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that surfactant migration is more effective with a fluorinated surface treatment compared to an untreated quartz surface. This result shows that the use of fluorinated surfactants must be accompanied by a surface treatment that produces a similar energy or polarity to induce migration and lower the adhesive strength.", "We report on the use of two original techniques for the quality evaluation of nanoimprint lithography with 50 nm feature size: sub-wavelength blazed diffraction gratings and photoacoustic metrology. Sub-wavelength diffraction has been used to characterise nanoscale structures by studying the diffraction patterns of visible wavelengths of light from gratings which are made up of features below the diffraction limit. Diffraction efficiencies of the diffracted orders are related to the nanoscale line-widths, heights and defects of the gratings. A stamp of a sub-wavelength blazed grating was fabricated by electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching in silicon and imprinted by NIL with different tools. Measured diffraction efficiencies agree with those from finite difference time domain simulations and we demonstrated the possibility to distinguish diffraction patterns from successfully imprinted gratings and those with a defect. The photoacoustic method has been used for the first time to study nanoimprint polymers. Signals were obtained from the top and bottom interfaces of polymer layers with aluminium and silicon, respectively, and thicknesses calculated from the time of flight of the acoustic wave and modelling physical parameters of the polymers, agree well with those measured by profilometry.", "When manufacturing prototype devices or low volume custom logic LSIs, the products are being less profitable because of the skyrocketing mask and design costs recent technology node. For 65nm technology node and beyond, the reduction of mask cost becomes critical issue for logic devices especially. We attempt to apply EBDW mainly to critical interconnect layers to reduce the mask expenditure for the reason of technical output reusability. For 65nm node production, new 300mm EB direct writer had been installed. The process technologies have also been developing to meet sufficient qualities and productivities.", "New types of alignment marks to be applied in electron beam direct write (EBDW) have been studied theoretically and experimentally. The dependence of signal contrast and signal form on such mark properties like step height, mark pitch and stack material has been investigated in detail using Monte Carlo simulations. The different alignment marks were etched in Si to different depths and the respective alignment repeatability was determined with a Vistec SB3050 DW lithography tool. Finally, for the most promising mark, test exposures were performed and the overlay determined.", "Line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) have raised questions and concerns as current lithography techniques reduce critical dimensions (CD) below 50 nm. There are few applications of controlled variation of LER and LWR, even among those which use electron beam direct writing (EBDW), although it is highly desirable to test the influence of systematical variation of LER and LWR on actual semiconductor devices. To get a clear understanding how and what the LERs and LWRs are influencing in EBDW, we have designed and fabricated transistor gates with programmed LER and LWR using EBDW and observed those based on CD-SEM metrology. The obtained results including calculated power spectrum density (PSD) shows the capability of EBDW to control the LER/LWR. Further, the influence of edge/width roughness in EBDW on device characteristics is reviewed and it gives how the effect of LWR/LER translates to device performance in DRAM process flow. It is found that the control of LWR is more important than that of LER for future lithography developments.", "Proton beam writing (p-beam writing) is a process which uses a focused beam of MeV protons to pattern resist material at nanodimensions. This makes p-beam writing the only one tool for fast prototyping of high aspect ratio structures with vertical walls up to 60\u03bcm and high aspect ratio values with details down to the 20 nm level. The process, although similar in many ways to direct writing using electrons, nevertheless offers some interesting and unique advantages. Protons, being more massive, have deeper penetration in materials whilst maintaining even energy deposition along a straight path, enabling p-beam writing to fabricate 3D high aspect ratio structures with vertical smooth sidewalls and low line edge roughness. Calculations have also indicated that p-beam writing exhibits minimal proximity effects, since the secondary electrons induced in proton/electron collisions have low energy. A platform technology to integrate 3D nanowires is proposed through high aspect ratio nanofabrication using p-beam writing.", "The ASML extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) alpha demo tool is a 0.25NA fully functional lithography tool with a field size of 26\u00d733 mm2, enabling process development for sub-40-nm technology. Two exposure tools are installed at customer facilities, and are equipped with a Sn discharge source. In this paper we present data measured at intermediate focus of the Sn source-collector module. We also present performance data from both exposure tools, show the latest results of resist exposures including excellent 32-nm half pitch dense staggered and aligned contact hole images, and present the highlights of the first demonstration of an electrically functional full field device with one of the layers made using EUVL in ASML's alpha demo tool.", "Extreme Ultra Violet Lithography (EUVL) has been widely regarded as the lithography technology to succeed optical lithography. It is now considered as one of the most promising technologies below hp45nm node [1], following ArF immersion lithography considering trend of achievable process K1 factors. In this paper we would like to present our significant progress on the development of EUV exposure tool. There are several key important areas which should be developed to realize EUVL to be feasible, such as reflective mask, resist, and tool itself. The reflective mask features such characteristics as pellicle-less, ultra-smooth blank flatness and defect free. The resist should be of high sensitivity and small line edge roughness (LER) as well as fine resolution. EUV exposure tool itself consists of major modules such as EUV light source, projection optics, vacuum body, vacuum stages, and so on. Nikon has developed new polishing technologies such as ion-beam figuring and elastic emission machining, and new ultra high-precision interferometers for aspheric surface metrology. Our multi-layer coating technology has been also improved. High reflective Mo/Si multi layer coating has been successfully achieved and irradiation tests using synchrotron radiation have been conducted. Successful achievement of those developments enables us to produce full-field projection optics for EUVL process development tool called EUV1. The proto-type development of full-field projection optics has been successfully completed and its technical achievement has reflected into production optics. Preparation of complete set of production and metrology tools necessary for projection optics production was completed and all tools are now in full operation. Nikon has already developed dual pod reticle carrier for EUV1 tool. In parallel Nikon has been developing the same concept carrier for HVM in cooperation with Canon and Entegris. Regarding to EUV1 tool development, all modules of EUV1 such as full-field projection optics module, illumination optics module, vacuum body module, vacuum compatible reticle/wafer stage modules, reticle/wafer loader modules, EUV light source module have been completed. Nikon has already started EUV1 module installation process and the module level function and basic performance have been being checked. Nikon will complete module integration to achieve the first exposure result. Some development results will be shown which lead to confidence for realization of EUVL. Nikon also would like to announce that development of 1st generation production EUVL tool named EUV2 has been studied.", "We developed a small field exposure tool (SFET) in collaboration with EUVA (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography System Development Association). SFET was installed at SELETE (Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies; Japanese Consortium) in 2006. SFET is positioned as a cornerstone of the manufacturing technologies for EUVL Full- Field tools as well as tool for resist and mask development. We started the system design of the Full-Field tool and fabrication of the six-mirror projection optics based on the experience of the SFET. In this paper, we introduce the outline of Canon's activities for the full-field tool. EUVL is requested to resolve the sub 30 nm features. The studies of the resolution for higher NA EUV projection optics is also presented.", "Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) is the leading candidate beyond 32nm half-pitch device manufacturing. Having completed the installation of the ASML EUV full-field scanner, IMEC has a fully-integrated 300mm EUVL process line. Our current focus is on satisfying the specifications to produce real devices in our facilities. This paper reports on the imaging fingerprint of the EUV Alpha Demo Tool (ADT), detailing resolution, imaging, and overlay performance. Particular emphasis is given to small pitch contact holes, which are a critical layer for advanced manufacturing nodes and one of the most likely layers where EUVL may take over from 193nm lithography. Imaging of contact holes, pattern transfer and successful printing of the contact hole level on a 32nm SRAM device is demonstrated. The impact of flare and shadowing on EUV ADT performance is characterized experimentally, enabling the implementation of appropriate mitigation strategies.", "In this paper, we describe the integration of EUV lithography into a standard semiconductor manufacturing flow to produce demonstration devices. 45 nm logic test chips with functional transistors were fabricated using EUV lithography to pattern the first interconnect level (metal 1). This device fabrication exercise required the development of rule-based 'OPC' to correct for flare and mask shadowing effects. These corrections were applied to the fabrication of a full-field mask. The resulting mask and the 0.25-NA fullfield EUV scanner were found to provide more than adequate performance for this 45 nm logic node demonstration. The CD uniformity across the field and through a lot of wafers was 6.6% (3\u03c3) and the measured overlay on the test-chip (product) wafers was well below 20 nm (mean + 3\u03c3). A resist process was developed and performed well at a sensitivity of 3.8 mJ/cm2, providing ample process latitude and etch selectivity for pattern transfer. The etch recipes provided good CD control, profiles and end-point discrimination, allowing for good electrical connection to the underlying levels, as evidenced by electrical test results. Many transistors connected with Cu-metal lines defined using EUV lithography were tested electrically and found to have characteristics very similar to 45 nm node transistors fabricated using more traditional methods.", "Final adjustment of EUV1 projection optics was completed and its performance was evaluated. Wavefront error of 0.6nmRMS in average through the exposure field was achieved. The maximum and minimum wavefront errors in the whole field were 0.8nmRMS and 0.3nmRMS, respectively. Flare of the projection optics was estimated from the measured power spectrum density (PSD) of each aspheric mirror of the projection optics. The flare value for Kirk pattern with the radius of 1\u03bcm was estimated to be about 10%. Completed projection optics was installed into the main body of EUV1. Optimization of polishing process was further pursued. Consequently, LSFR of 38pmRMS, MSFR of 80pmRMS and HSFR of 68pmRMS were achieved. Assemble of the illumination-optics unit for EUV1 was completed and its performance was evaluated using an illumination-optics test stand. Irradiation uniformity on the mask plane, pupil fill and so on were measured with the test stand using a visible light and EUV radiation. Completed illumination-optics unit was installed into the main body of EUV1. Reflection-type spectral purity filter (SPF) and high-NA projection-optics design were investigated as new R&D items for the future optics of EUV exposure tools.", "In this work we present the smoothing properties of our ion beam smoothened multilayers and, based on the same technology, the extreme smoothing properties in the high and near mid spatial frequency range of a single-material smoothing layer. Coating results of high reflectance multilayers both on rough substrates and on substrates smoothened with silicon bufferlayers are discussed.", "We are developing a laser produced plasma light source for high volume manufacturing (HVM) EUV lithography. The light source is based on a high power, high repetition rate CO2 laser system, a tin target and a magnetic ion guiding for tin treatment. The laser system is a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) configuration. We have achieved an average laser output power of 10 kW at 100 kHz by a single laser beam with good beam quality. EUV in-band power equivalent to 60 W at intermediate focus was produced by irradiating a tin rotating plate with 6 kW laser power. This light source is scalable to more than 200 W EUV in-band power based on a 20-kW CO2 laser. Collector mirror life can be extended by using droplet target and magnetic ion guiding. Effectiveness of the magnetic ion guiding is examined by monitoring the motion of fast Sn ion in a large vacuum chamber with a maximum magnetic flux density of 2 T.", "EUVL source development at XTREME technologies benefits from the learning gained in previous developments for EUV Micro Exposure and Alpha Tools. Field data available from operation of these tools represent the basis for continuous improvement in core technology areas such as plasma generation and forming, component reliability, debris mitigation and optical performance. Results from integration and first operation of alpha tool sources are presented in the areas power performance, component lifetime and debris mitigation efficiency. The analysis results and simulation work of the realized EUV source concept are discussed and innovative concepts for component and module improvements are introduced. In term of intermediate focus power, 4W has been achieved. Moreover the factor of 1.6 higher IF power to previous results has been implied to demonstrate capability for the achievement of more than 5W. For the Beta-tool and HVM source generations a joint development work between XTREME technologies and Philips EUV is introduced. The related work is content of another presentation of this conference.", "For industrial EUV (extreme ultra-violet) lithography applications high power extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources are needed at a central wavelength of 13.5 nm, targeting 32 nm node and below. Philips Extreme UV GmbH and XTREME technologies GmbH have developed DPP (Discharge Produced Plasma) Alpha tools which run in operation at several locations in the world. In this paper the status of the Alpha Sn-DPP tools as developed by Philips Extreme UV GmbH will be given. The Alpha DPP tools provide a good basis for the development and engineering of the Beta tools and in the future of the HVM tools. The first Beta source has been designed and first light has been produced. Engineering steps will folow to optimize this first generation Beta Sn-DPP source. HVM tools target EUV power levels from 200W to 500W in IF. In this paper we show that the power requried for HVM can be generated with Sn-DPP sources. Based on Alpha Sn-DPP sources we show that repetition frequency and generated EUV pulse energy is scalable up to power levels that match the HVM requirements.", "A mass spectrometry and time-resolved shadowgraphy study is presented, focusing on the radiators/debris transport process for an LPP-EUVL source, under worst-case scenarios such as solid target, wide angular dispersion, etc. The solid angle of ion debris ejection increases as a function of plume lifetime, and up to 0.5 \u03bcs (approx. 15 mm above target) does not exceed 0.3 \u03c0sr. around the target normal. The plume expansion is hypersonic (15-20 km/s) with the formation of a bow shock with an initial length scale of 5-8 mm that gradually reduces its aspect ratio. Primary (low energy) ion debris is induced directly during laser-surface interaction, whereas almost 90% of these primary ions are converted to Z=6 -12 secondary fast ions by means of laser-plasma interaction. At very high laser power, the fraction of primary ions converted to high charge ions is diminished to 70%, possibly due to increased LPP shielding. Hence, the external atomic degrees of freedom (kinetic energy) and the internal degrees of freedom (electronic configuration) are pumped concomitantly, which presents a tradeoff to combine fast ion debris minimization and efficient radiators' maximization. Nevertheless, the radiating body is observed fairly static with time, with a length-scale of a few mm's. Hence, the decoupling of the mass flux and radiation flux may be achieved either in the short (10< t < 100 ns) or in the very long (t > 500 ns) time scales. Considering the EUV emission time scale constraints, the former is the only viable solution for enabling LPP-based EUVL.", "We propose a new scheme for high conversion efficiency from laser energy to 13.5 nm extreme ultra violet emission within 2 % band width, a double pulse laser irradiation scheme with a tin droplet target. We consider two-color lasers, a Nd:YAG laser with 1.06 \u00b5m in wavelength as a prepulse and a carbon dioxide laser with 10.6 \u00b5m in wavelength for a main pulse. We show the possibility of obtaining a CE of 5 - 7 % using a benchmarked radiation hydro code. We have experimentally tested the new scheme and observed increase of CE greater than 4 %. We show many additional advantages of the new scheme, such as reduction of neutral debris, energy reduction of debris ions, and decrease of out of band emission. We also discuss debris problems, such as ion sputtering using newly developed MD simulations, ion mitigation by a newly designed magnetic coil using 3-PIC simulations and tin cleaning experiments.", "The conversion efficiency and potential for debris of planar and spherical targets of laser-produced tin-plasmas for use in a high-volume manufacturing EUVL source collector module are computationally examined. A Nd:YAG laser beam is used to irradiate the targets under different irradiances and pulse durations. A two-dimensional/axisymmetric hydrodynamic code, an atomic physics code and an analytical model are used to perform simulations of the laser-plasma processes. The predicted conversion efficiencies are in good agreement with data reported from experiments. The optimum laser parameters yield maximum conversion efficiencies of 1.86% and 1.45%, respectively for the planar and spherical targets. However, the spherical target is best suited for low cost-of-ownership, as it has significantly lower neutral debris compared to the planar target. The key finding of this work is that the laser produced plasmas of both planar and spherical targets are non-uniform. These non-uniformities must be accounted for in the design of collection optics and debris mitigation schemes.", "The paper presents the results of an investigation into the thermal and optical characteristics of alpha-type dual-mirror grazing incidence collectors for Extreme Ultra-violet Lithography integrated into a tin-fueled discharge produced plasma source. The performance of the system is assessed at various power levels and temperature conditions. The thermal and the optical data, in particular images at extra-focal planes behind the intermediate focus, are compared to the predictions of the thermo-optical model of the system. The data we present provide verification of the models used to design the collector and validation of the thermo-optical modeling approach for design of future generations of collectors.", "Current devices for EUV lithography combine both laser and discharge physics to achieve sufficient brightness with minimum debris generation to support the throughput requirements of High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM) lithography exposure tools with long lifetime. Source performance, Debris mitigation, and reflector system are critical to efficient EUV collection and component lifetime. Integrated models are developed to simulate EUV emission at high power and debris generation and transport in hybrid EUV devices. The models being developed include, for example, new ideas and parameters of laser beams in discharge devices. In addition, optimization of source parameters, combination magnetic fields and gas jet parameters to significantly reduce the debris, and mirror surface conditions to enhance the reflectivity of EUV. Source optimization studies include full 3-D simulation of laser interaction with tin targets followed by discharge simulation to produce the optimum EUV photons. Initial simulations show that for HVM devices a combination of source optimization, innovative debris mitigation system, and understanding debris/mirror interaction is required to achieve the lifetime needed.", "Our goal is to provide insights into surface processes that affect the reflectivity and lifetimes of TiO2 and Ru-capped multilayer mirrors used in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Several surface-sensitive ultrahigh-vacuum techniques are used to characterize thermally-induced and electron-induced surface reactions of methyl methacrylate (MMA), a model for hydrocarbons found in EUV lithography vacuum chambers; low-energy electron beams are used to mimic excitations initiated by EUV radiation. Carbon film growth is measured on TiO2 surfaces during electron bombardment (at 20 eV and 100 eV) in MMA vapor; C growth rates are compared on Ru surfaces. The initial rates on the clean surfaces are very different: a C film grows more rapidly on TiO2 than on Ru. However, the limiting growth rates are the same for C thicknesses greater than ~1 to 1.5 nm, when MMA interacts with a C film. Irradiation of the C films in O2 gas, or in MMA + O2, has a mitigating effect on TiO2 surfaces.", "Lifetime of EUVL masks which are intentionally contaminated with carbon is investigated by comparing Si and Ru capping layer. Carbon deposition is observed not only on the multilayer, but also on the absorber sidewall of the mask. Deposited carbon on the sidewall during EUV exposure gradually varies mask CD and also induces the changes in the wafer printability and dose in the scanner. In addition, we compare the effects of carbon contamination between Si and Ru capped blank. Ru capped blank shows longer mask mean time between cleaning (MTBC) than Si capped blank by 25% in our experiments.", "The deposition characteristics of carbon film on EUV mask surface, the impact of carbon deposition on lithography performance, and cleaning of deposited carbon film on EUV mask are studied. The density of the carbon film was found to be nearly half of that of graphite by X-ray reflectivity measurement. The impact of carbon deposition on the lithography performance was simulated by SOLID-EUV. The CD variation by carbon deposition on the mask depends on the deposition profile on the absorber pattern. Intentionally created contaminated masks were treated by a cleaning process using atomic hydrogen. The cleaning efficiency and durability of film materials are discussed.", "The ability to predict the rate of reflectivity loss of capped multilayer mirrors (MLMs) under various conditions of ambient vacuum composition, intensity, and previous dose is crucial to solving the mirror lifetime problem in an EUV stepper. Previous measurements at NIST have shown that reflectivity loss of MLMs exposed under accelerated conditions of dose and pressure can be a very complicated function of these variables. The present work continues this effort and demonstrates that reflectivity loss does not scale linearly for accelerated exposure doses over the range of 0-350 J/mm2 either for partial pressures of MMA in the range 10-8-10-7 Torr or acetone in the range 10-7-10-6 Torr. We suggest that this nonlinear scaling may be the result of a varying damage rate as the surface of the growing contamination layer moves through the EUV standing wave created by exposure of any MLM to resonant radiation. To further investigate the potential influence of these resonance effects, we report new measurements showing large variations of the secondary electron yield as a function of thickness of carbon deposited on top of a MLM.", "The lifetime of Mo/Si multilayer-coated projection optics is one of the outstanding issues on the road of commercialization of extreme-ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). The application of Mo/Si multilayer optics in EUVL requires both sufficient radiation stability and also the highest possible normal-incidence reflectivity. A serious problem of conventional high-reflective Mo/Si multilayers capped by silicon is the considerable degradation of reflective properties due to carbonization and oxidation of the silicon surface layer under exposure by EUV radiation. In this study, we focus on titanium dioxide (TiO2) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) as promising capping layer materials for EUVL multilayer coatings. The multilayer designs as well as the deposition parameters of the Mo/Si systems with different capping layers were optimized in terms of maximum peak reflectivity at the wavelength of 13.5 nm and longterm stability under high-intensive irradiation. Optimized TiO2-capped Mo/Si multilayer mirrors with an initial reflectivity of 67.0% presented a reflectivity drop of 0.6% after an irradiation dose of 760 J/mm2. The reflectivity drop was explained by the partial oxidation of the silicon sub-layer. No reflectivity loss after similar irradiation dose was found for RuO2-capped Mo/Si multilayer mirrors having initial peak reflectivity of 66%. In this paper we present data on improved reflectivity of interface-engineered TiO2- and RuO2-capped Mo/Si multilayer mirrors due to the minimization of both interdiffusion processes inside the multilayer stack and absorption loss in the oxide layer. Reflectivities of 68.5% at the wavelength of 13.4 nm were achieved for both TiO2- and RuO2-capped Mo/Si multilayer mirrors.", "A new fast-CAD imaging model for buried extreme ultra violet (EUV) mask defects is presented that exploits the smoothing process used to mitigate buried EUV multilayer defects. Since the characteristics of the smoothing process dictate nearly identical surface shapes for all defects a single parameter, the peak height of the final profile, is sufficient to predict the projection printed image for an arbitrary buried defect. Data is presented on the effect of smoothing on the reflected field and final wafer image. The degree of similarity among defects with different initial heights, widths and shapes is explored. A compact algebraic model to predict the aerial image dip strength is developed that depends only on the surface height of the EUV mask blank. This model is then integrated into a standard perturbation model for defect feature interaction, and the importance of accounting for absorber features shadowing of buried defects is demonstrated.", "It seems that the actual EUV lithography tools will have aberrations around ten times larger than those of the latest ArF lithography tools in wavelength normalized rms. We calculated the influence of aberrations on the size error and pattern shift error using Zernike sensitivity analysis. Mask-induced aberration restricts the specification of aberration. Without periodic additional pattern, the aberration to form 22 nm dual-gate patterns was below 8 m\u03bb rms. Arranging the periodic additional pattern relaxed the aberration tolerance. With periodic additional pattern, the aberration to form 22 nm patterns was below 37 m\u03bb rms. It is important to make pattern periodicity for the relaxation of the aberration specification.", "EUV lithography is one of the hot candidates for the 22nm node. A well known phenomenon in EUV lithography is the impact of non-telecentricity and the mask topography on printing performance. Due to oblique illumination of the mask, layout, the printed features are shifted and biased on the wafer with respect to their target dimension up to several nanometers. This effect is inherent to EUV imaging systems. In order to maintain CDU, overlay and registration requirements, these effects need to be compensated for as part of the lithographic manufacturing process. Conventional compensation techniques, such as OPC compensation, significantly increase the complexity of the litho process. In this paper we discuss pattern shift, which is induced by mask-side non-telecentricity of the EUV ring field system. In particular, we show how the mask position relative to the focal plane of the projection system impacts pattern shift. It is shown that mask focus shift allows for a compensation of pattern shift, independent on angle of incidence, pattern type, pattern pitch, pattern orientation, and slit position. Thus it is seen that placement error is not an effect related to mask topography (not a shadowing effect) but arises purely from the mask non-telecentricity. A geometric interpretation of this effect is given and shown to be consistent with results of rigorous simulations. A method to simulate the shift of the mask focus position is briefly discussed. The mask focus shift for which the pattern shift vanishes in the aerial wafer image at best focus is determined using rigorous simulations. The amount of mask focus shift to compensate for the pattern shift is found to be approximately 136nm. This mask focus shift is then applied to investigate the through focus and dose behavior of the pattern shift in the resist. It is shown that the pattern shift is a function of wafer focus position and that this is a result of the image tilt in EUV systems. While the pattern shift is fully compensated at one wafer focus position, the shift at other positions is very small. The impact of the mask focus position on process window is investigated.", "We shipped a small field exposure tool (SFET) to Selete (Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Japanese Consortium) in 2006. The SFET was founded for the purpose of EUVL mask and resist development. We have been working on the exposure test and the tool evaluation in collaboration with Selete. In the development of the SFET, We have experienced to connect two types of light source to the SFET, LPP light source and DPP light source. And now we operate the SFET with DPP light source. On exchanging light source for DPP light source from LPP light source, we planed to apply the new illuminator unit optimized for DPP light source. The new illuminator unit of the SFET will improve dose uniformity on the imaging surface. We have installed the new illuminator unit of the SFET at Selete in 2007, and evaluated the effects of dose uniformity. In EUV lithography, the system performance reflects sensitively to the exposure results. We have been evaluating the SFET quantitatively on mainly sensitive factors, in the system performance, to exposure result. We try to take a correlation between the system performance and exposure results. In the system performance, the synchronization error between the wafer and mask stages is one of the main factors to exposure sensitivity. We continue to evaluate the relations between the system performance and the exposure results.", "The effects of aberration and flare on the lithographic performance of the EUV small-field exposure tool (SFET) were evaluated. Simulation results indicated that the effect of aberration on the image contrast of line-and-space (L&S) patterns should be small. In exposure experiments, 26-45-nm L&S patterns were successfully fabricated under annular illumination (\u03c3=0.3/0.7). A key factor limiting resolution should be resist performance. Simulation results also indicated that the astigmatic aberration could produce a focal shift of about 60 nm between horizontal and vertical L&S patterns. The experimentally obtained focus shift agreed well with the simulation results. Dense 32-45-nm contact-hole (C/H) patterns were also successfully fabricated under annular illumination (\u03c3=0.3/0.5). Due to astigmatic aberration, the C/H patterns were deformed at defocused positions, but they were almost circular at the best focus position. The flare of the projection optics measured by the Kirk method was 11% over a flare range of 1-100 \u03bcm. The effects of the 11% flare were evaluated using dark- and bright-field 32-nm L&S patterns. It was found that the top loss and line-width roughness (LWR) of the resist were larger for bright-field than for dark-field patterns. To reduce the impact of flare, we need EUV resists that are more robust with regard to flare. A comparison of the measured point spread function (PSF) of the flare and the calculated PSF revealed good agreement for long-range flare but some difference for short-range flare.", "Recent experimental results and modeling both indicate that whereas it is possible to optimize a photoresist and process to achieve separately a desired resolution or line edge roughness or sensitivity, it will be difficult if not impossible to achieve all three simultaneously using current standard chemically amplified photoresists and processes. This tradeoff among Resolution, Line Edge Roughness (LER) and Sensitivity is termed the RLS tradeoff. Here we review the progress to date of a SEMATECH-funded program to develop an experimentally verified model of the relationship among resolution, LER and sensitivity and use it to determine approaches for \"breaking\" the RLS tradeoff.", "The 2007 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)1 specifies Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography as one leading technology option for the 32nm half-pitch node, and significant world wide effort is being focused towards this goal. Readiness of EUV photoresists is one of the risk areas. In 2007, the ITRS modified performance targets for high-volume manufacturing EUV resists to better reflect fundamental resist materials challenges. For 32nm half-pitch patterning at EUV, a photospeed range from 5-30 mJ/cm2 and low-frequency linewidth roughness target of 1.7nm (3\u03c3) have been specified. Towards this goal, the joint INVENT activity (AMD, CNSE, IBM, Micron, and Qimonda) at Albany evaluated a broad range of EUV photoresists using the EUV MET at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories (LBNL), and the EUV interferometer at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Switzerland. Program goals targeted resist performance for 32nm and 22nm groundrule development activities, and included interim relaxation of ITRS resist performance targets. This presentation will give an updated review of the results. Progress is evident in all areas of EUV resist patterning, particularly contact/via and ultrathin resist film performance. We also describe a simplified figure-of-merit approach useful for more quantitative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current materials.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresists are known to outgas during exposure to EUV radiation in the vacuum environment. This is of particular concern since some of the outgassed species may contaminate the nearby EUV optics and cause a loss of reflectivity and therefore throughput of the EUV exposure tools. Due to this issue, work has been performed to measure the species and quantities that outgas from EUV resists. Additionally, since the goal of these measurements is to determine the relative safety of various resists near EUV optics, work has been performed to measure the deposition rate of the outgassed molecules on Mo/Si-coated witness plate samples. The results for various species and tests show little measurable effect from resist components on optics contamination with modest EUV exposure doses.", "The photon-stimulated emission of organic molecules from the photoresist during exposure is a serious problem for extreme-ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) because the adsorption of the outgassing products on the EUV optics can lead to carbonization and subsequent reflectivity loss. In order to accurately quantify the total amount of outgassing for a given resist during an exposure, we have constructed a compact, portable chamber that is instrumented with a spinning rotor gauge and a capacitance diaphragm gauge that, unlike the more commonly used ionization gauge or quadrupole mass spectrometer, provides a direct and accurate measurement of the total pressure that is largely independent of the composition of the outgas products. We have also developed a method to perform compositional analysis on the outgas products and, more generally, on any contaminants that might be present in the stepper vacuum. The method involves collecting the vacuum contaminants in a trap cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature. Once collected, the products from the trap are transferred to a system for analysis with gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. We will describe the workings of the instruments in detail as well as results of initial tests.", "Base titration methods are used to determine C-parameters for three industrial EUV photoresist platforms (EUV- 2D, MET-2D, XP5496) and twenty academic EUV photoresist platforms. X-ray reflectometry is used to measure the density of these resists, and leads to the determination of absorbance and film quantum yields (FQY). Ultrahigh levels of PAG show divergent mechanisms for production of photoacids beyond PAG concentrations of 0.35 moles/liter. The FQY of sulfonium PAGs level off, whereas resists prepared with iodonium PAG show FQYs that increase beyond PAG concentrations of 0.35 moles/liter, reaching record highs of 8-13 acids generated/EUV photons absorbed.", "In this work, the authors demonstrate the suitability of Step and Flash\u00ae Imprint Lithography (S-FIL\u00ae) materials as a mask for patterning 42 nm and 32 nm half pitch features into a hardmask material. We present a zero etch-bias process with good silicon oxide to imprint resist selectivity and excellent line-width roughness (LWR) control. We demonstrate the required etch processes and mean value and uniformity of the residual layer thickness (RLT) necessary to maintain cross wafer CD uniformity for 42 nm and 32 nm half pitch dense lines. Finally, the authors present a mechanism for targeting the critical dimension by control of the imprint resist volume.", "Imprint lithography has been shown to be an effective method for the replication of nanometer-scale structures from an imprint mask (template) or mold. Step and Flash Imprint Lithography (S-FIL\u00ae) is unique in its ability to address both resolution and alignment. Recently overlay across a 200 mm wafer of less than 20nm, 3\u03c3 has been demonstrated. Current S-FIL resolution and alignment performance motivates the consideration of nano-imprint lithography as a Next Generation Lithography (NGL) solution for IC production. During the S-FIL process, a transferable image, an imprint, is produced by mechanically molding a liquid UV-curable resist on a wafer. Acceptance of imprint lithography for CMOS manufacturing will require demonstration that it can attain defect levels commensurate with the requirements of cost-effective device production. This report summarizes the result of defect inspections of wafers patterned using S-FIL. Wafer inspections were performed with KLA Tencor- 2132 (KT-2132) and KLA Tencor eS23 (KT-eS32) automated patterned wafer inspection tools. Imprint specific defectivity was shown to be \u22643 cm-2 with some wafers having defectivity of less than 1 cm-2 and many fields having 0 imprint specific defects, as measured with the KT-2132. KT eS32 inspection of 32 nm half pitch features indicated that the random defectivity resulting from the imprint process was low.", "Direct patterning of low-dielectric constant (low-k) materials via nanoimprint lithography (NIL) has the potential to simplify fabrication processes and significantly reduce the manufacturing costs for semiconductor devices. We report direct imprinting of sub-100 nm features into a high modulus methylsilsesquioxane-based organosilicate glass (OSG) material. An excellent fidelity of the pattern transfer process is quantified with nm precision using critical dimension small angle X-ray scattering (CD-SAXS) and specular X-ray reflectivity (SXR). X-ray porosimetry (XRP) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) measurements indicate that imprinting increases the inherent microporosity of the methylsilsequioxane-based OSG material. When a porogen (pore generating material) is added, imprinting decreases the population of mesopores associated with the porogen while retaining the enhanced microporosity. The net effect is a decrease the pore interconnectivity. There is also evidence for a sealing effect that is interpreted as an imprint induced dense skin at the surface of the porous pattern.", "In nanoimprint with UV curable resin, a mold fabricated by etching quartz by using Cr as a hard mask is generally used. For fine pattern fabrication, Cr fine pattern etching technology is very important. Usually, the realization of enough resolution needs a resist thickness reduction, which, however, makes it difficult to etch extremely fine Cr features with vertical sidewalls. Here, we propose a brand-new method called \"reverse EB process\". In this method, an electron-beam (EB) resist pattern is first reversed by a plasma-robust material, with which as a mask, the Cr is then etched to form a hard mask for the mold etching. By this process, we have realized a quartz mold with patterns of 16nm in half pitch at minimum.", "Projection Mask-Less Lithography (PML2) is a potentially cost-effective multi electron-beam solution for the 32nm-node and beyond. PML2 is targeted on using hundreds of thousands of individually addressable electron-beams working in parallel, thereby pushing the potential throughput into the wafers per hour regime. With resolution limits <10nm, PML2 is designed to meet the requirements of several upcoming tool generations. A PML2 proof-of-concept setup was realized within the framework of the European RIMANA project. It contains all crucial components of a full-fledged PML2 tool and unambiguously demonstrates the operability of multi electron-beam projection optics with 200x reduction. In the PML2 proof-of-concept system more than 2000 switchable beams are generated by a programmable aperture plate system (APS) and projected onto wafer level with 200x demagnification. Current density (~2 A/cm2) and total current (~10 pA) of each beam are the same as in future PML2 tools, resulting in a calculated base resolution below 10nm. The PML2 proof-of-concept column has been successfully tested using resolution templates, verifying 200x reduction and the predicted 22nm hp resolution capability. Furthermore, first custom designed 32nm hp structures were printed into resist coated Si wafers using an APS test-unit. Based on the inputs obtained by the PML2 proof-of-concept system and detailed electron-optical calculations, a fully industry-compatible PML2 Alpha-tool will be realized within the European MAGIC project. Together with the infrastructure developed within MAGIC, this PML2 Alpha-tool promises to herald the introduction of mask-less lithography into the industrial environment.", "MAPPER Lithography is developing a maskless lithography technology. The technology combines massively-parallel electron-beam writing with high speed optical data transport used in the telecommunication industry. The electron optics generates 13,000 electron beams that are focused on the wafer by electrostatic lens arrays which are manufactured by using MEMS manufacturing techniques. Each beam has its own optical column to avoid a central cross-over. This secures high throughput (> 10 wafers per hour) at high resolution (< 45 nm half pitch). The 13,000 e-beams are generated by splitting up a single electron beam that originates from a single electron source and are finally accelerated to 5 kV to expose the resist on the wafer. The e-beams are arranged in such a way that they form a rectangular slit with a width of 26 mm, the same width of a field in an optical stepper. During exposure the e-beams are deflected over 2 \u03bcm perpendicular to the wafer stage movement. This means that with one scan of the wafer a full field of 26 mm x 33 mm can be exposed. During the simultaneous scanning of the wafer and deflection of the electron beams the beams are switched on and off by 13,000 light signals, one for each e-beam. The light beams are generated in a data system that contains the chip patterns in a bitmap format. This bitmap is divided over 13,000 data channels and streamed to the ebeams at 1-10 GHz. This paper will explain the design drivers behind the system and provide more detail on the current design. Finally, results of our technology Demonstrator are presented, showing the viability of MAPPER's concept.", "The Multiple E-beam Direct Write (MEBDW) technology has been considered a promising solution for the next generation lithography to delineate 32-nm half-pitch and beyond. A low-energy, say 5 keV, e-beam direct writing system has advantages in lower exposure dosage, less heating effect on resist, and less damage to devices underneath, comparing with a high energy one, such as 50 keV or 100 keV. However, the low-energy electron-beam is easily blurred due to forward scattering in the substrate due to its shallow penetration and hence loses resolution. In this paper, variables affecting patterning fidelity of a raster-scan MEBDW system are investigated. In order to realize a MEBDW system with acceptable throughput, a relatively large beam size is chosen for sufficient beam current to sustain throughput while maintaining enough resolution. The imaging resolution loss and the proximity effect, due to beam blurring through the resist, have been observed. The in-house software MOSES, incorporating the Monte Carlo simulation and the Double Gaussian model was used to evaluate 1-D and 2-D pattern fidelity with various exposure conditions. The line width roughness, which represents 1-D fidelity, was evaluated on 32-nm dense lines. Pattern fidelity of 2-D features such as the zigzag poly line and dense metal patterns was also examined. The impact to LWR of using the edge dithering method, instead of dosage modulation, to control the line width accuracy beyond the pixel size was studied.", "With the willingness of the semiconductor industry to push manufacturing costs down, the mask less lithography solution represents a promising option to deal with the cost and complexity concerns about the optical lithography solution. Though a real interest, the development of multi beam tools still remains in laboratory environment. In the frame of the seventh European Framework Program (FP7), a new project, MAGIC, started January 1st 2008 with the objective to strengthen the development of the mask less technology. The aim of the program is to develop multi beam systems from MAPPER and IMS nanofabrication technologies and the associated infrastructure for the future tool usage. This paper draws the present status of multi beam lithography and details the content and the objectives of the MAGIC project.", "The beam energy is a driving design parameter for electron beam lithography systems. To be able to compare the differences of low kV (5 kV) and high kV (100 kV) for a high-throughput system the limitations of both types of systems are evaluated. First the effect on the CD uniformity and throughput is analyzed. For any shot noise limited system the dose that is needed to obtain a required CD uniformity can be calculated. This dose depends on the total spot size and the efficiency of the electrons in the resist. For a smaller spot less dose is required than for a large spot. The current in a single beam is also determined by the spot size. A larger spot has more current. With these parameters an optimization of the required dose, spot size and single beam current can be made. It is found that although for high kV it is easier to create a small spot with a high current the low resist-exposure efficiency of the high-energy electrons limits the throughput, because the required dose is large. It is also found that for 10 wafers per hour multiple lenses or columns are required. For practical reasons (a high kV lens cannot be made as small as a low kV lens) there is a clear preference for the use of low energy in high-throughput systems. Another aspect that is crucial in the lithography process is the overlay. One of the main differences between high and low energy systems is the power that is dissipated in the wafer and the resulting error due to expansion. It is found that for both energies wafer heating is an issue, but for low kV there seem to be solutions, while for high kV the problem is 30 times bigger.", "We propose an electron beam (EB) shot minimization method for character projection electron beam direct writing (CP-EBDW) targeting metal layer patterns based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We have evaluated the proposed method with a commercial tool and demonstrated 20% shot reduction. We have also demonstrated that the runtime of the proposed EB shot minimization method grows exponentially against the number of matches. For this reason, we have suggested heuristic solutions to find the number of EB shots within a reasonable amount of time by means of segmentation of layout, limitation of runtime and setting of \"relative tolerance gap parameter\" in 0-1 ILP. The heuristic solutions have been proved to be effective when compared with the commercial tool for the same layout.", "We investigate a new technique for high current density beam formation called 3rd order imaging. This technique has two advantages: 1) increasing the beam current without beam blurring, and 2) producing a desired beam shape, such as a square or rectangle. Thus, it can significantly decrease writing times in Electron Beam Direct Writing (EBDW). These advantages are realized by using a patterned beam-defining aperture (PBDA) whose patterned openings work with the spherical aberration in the objective lens to generate the final beam shape. The PBDA transmits rays if they fall within the desired shape at the wafer, while blocking rays which would fall outside the desired shape. We have obtained beam line profiles and two-dimensional beam shapes experimentally. The 3rd-order imaging beam current density is seven times larger than that of a beam shaped by the conventional aperture. The experimental beam profile and the calculated result are in good agreement. The experimental two-dimensional shapes reproduce the calculated beam shapes, thereby verifying the theory of 3rd-order imaging. This technique is a potential solution to break through the technological impasse of high current density versus high resolution.", "EUV lithography is the leading candidate for sub-32nm half-pitch device manufacturing. This paper deals with the investigation of the impact of the mask blank architecture on the wafer print by EUV lithography. Presently the material stack on the mask is not fixed and different suppliers offer a range of variation. The purpose of the present paper is threefold, as detailed hereafter. First it is shown that there are possibilities to make EUV masks less prone to reflectivity loss by carbon contamination. An estimate is given for the required limitations on mask contamination and fabrication tolerance to keep the imaging impact below acceptable levels. These data can be used as preliminary error budgets for the individual and combined capping layer deterioration phenomena. Further-on, printing results on the Alpha Demo Tool (ADT) are reported, obtained with different reticles with identical layout produced on blanks with different mask stacks. In preparation for this experimental work simulations have been undertaken. The experimental results show good agreement in printing performance between the reticles tested. Finally, our work clearly shows the opportunity to reduce the absorber thickness without noticeable loss of contrast and with the big advantage of shadowing effect reduction.", "The availability of defect-free mask blanks is one of the most significant challenges facing the commercialization of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). The SEMATECH Mask Blank Development Center (MBDC) was created to drive the development of EUVL mask blanks to meet the industry's needs. EUV mask defects come from two primary sources: the incoming mask substrate and defects added during multilayer deposition. For incoming defects, we have both an in-house advanced cleaning capability and an advanced in situ defect smoothing capability. This smoothing system utilizes combinations of ion beam deposition and etch to planarize any remaining incoming substrate defects. For defects added in the multilayer deposition process, we have an aggressive program to find, identify, and eliminate the defects. This paper summarizes progress in smoothing substrate defects and eliminating ever smaller multilayer-added defects. We will show the capability of our smoothing process to planarize our existing population of bump and pit type defects and discuss how quickly this can be done. We will also discuss how many defects are added by the planarization process. In addition, we will show 54 nm sensitivity defect data for multilayer-coated EUV mask blanks.", "Determining the printability of substrate defects beneath the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) reflecting multilayer stack is an important issue in EUVL lithography. Several simulation studies have been performed in the past to determine the tolerable defect size on EUV mask blank substrates but the industry still has no exact specification based on real printability tests. Therefore, it is imperative to experimentally determine the printability of small defects on a mask blanks that are caused by substrate defects using direct printing of programmed substrate defect in an EUV exposure tool. SEMATECH fabricated bump type program defect masks using standard electron beam lithography and performed printing tests with the masks using an EUV exposure tool. Defect images were also captured using SEMATECH's Berkeley Actinic Imaging Tool in order to compare aerial defect images with secondary electron microscope images from exposed wafers. In this paper, a comprehensive understanding of substrate defect printability will be presented and printability specifications of EUV mask substrate defects will be discussed.", "Significant progress has been made over the past several years in developing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask infrastructure, especially in EUV reticle handling and protection. Today, the industry has converged to standardize the dual pod reticle carrier approach in developing EUV reticle handling solutions. SEMATECH has already established reticle handling infrastructure compliant with industry's draft standard, including carrier, robotic carrier handling, automated carrier cleaning, vacuum protection, and state-of-the-art particulate contamination testing capabilities. It proves to be one of the key enablers in developing EUV reticle protection solutions, through broad collaboration with industry stakeholders and suppliers. In this paper, we discuss our in-house reticle handling infrastructure and provide insights on how to apply it in EUV lithography pilot line development and future production line. We present particulate contamination free baseline results of state-of-the-art EUV reticle carriers, i.e., sPod, throughout lifecycle uses. We will also compare the results against requirements for 32 nm half-pitch (HP) EUV lithography, to identify the remaining challenges ahead of the industry.", "Defects are still one of the main challenges of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask blanks. In particular, a majority(~75%) of substrate defects are nanometer size pits. These pits are usually created during final surface polishing of the synthetic, quartz glass substrates. This study presents data that indicates cleaning may also induce pits in the substrate surface. These pits are typically 20 nm and larger, and are contained in a circular area on the surface, which is scanned by a megasonic nozzle during cleaning. Concentrated collapse of cavitation bubbles in the areas scanned by megasonic is expected to be one of the main mechanisms of pit creation. The data indicates the existence of a hard surface layer with an estimated thickness of approximately 30 to 60 nm, which is resistive to pit creation. After this layer is removed, the number of pit defects present on the substrate increases dramatically with megasonic cleaning. It is also demonstrated that, within the detection limits of the atomic force microscope (AFM), the size of a pit does not change due to cleaning.", "As industry advances towards the insertion of EUVL technology, researchers and manufacturers armed with alpha EUV light sources invent an expanding array of potential applications utilizing these sources. This in turn drives development of the light sources to fulfill the large field of specific needs in resist exposure, mirror testing, wafer inspection, etc., which call for a greater variety of source parameters, including output power, source size, and stability. The EQ-10 is a commercially available, medium-power (10 W/2\u03c0, 13.5nm \u00b11%, Xenon) electrodeless Z-pinch light source. Significant field experience and customer feedback has been accumulated from sources already in operation in multiple locations. In response, a development program is under way to re-engineer and optimize the EQ-10 for a variety of applications. Data will be presented on the effect of varying source geometry, frequency, and input power on pinch performance. We have observed a sustained integrated output power of over 15 Watts. The plasma size can be varied to suit customer applications. A related program on beamline design and optimization is also underway, focused on debris mitigation while also maintaining the efficiency of EUV power delivery. Initial results from this program will be summarized.", "A new inspection system with DUV laser beam and high NA optic for EUV mask has been developed to inspect defects on EUV blank mask and defects by process and handling. The development of new reflective image and optics has increased inspection speed on EUV mask before absorber etch and after absorber etch. Defect classification and operation has increased the productivity of inspection and particle control on EUV mask process. With this new inspection system, defects on blank mask, after resist develop and after etch processed mask were classified and evaluated to install EUV mask process. And defect sensitivities according to various pattern size and process steps were evaluated with required defect size of simulated printing effect on wafer. Designed defect pattern of 46nm node were prepared. Blank masks from Hoya were used. Patterns were exposed using 50KeV electron beam writer. After resist develop, patterns with program defect were inspected. After absorber etching, defects were inspected and evaluated. According to sub film, inspection condition was optimized. Using simulation tool, defects printability were simulated and compared with sensitivity of this inspection tool. Our results demonstrate that this inspection tool is very effective to detect and identify defects and their sources on EUV mask process. In this paper, mask inspection performance of high NA, DUV optic with short working distance was evaluated and described on programmed EUV mask.", "A low-cost fabrication method combining self-organized lithography and nanoimprint is proposed as a possible solution for patterned media production for the memory density beyond 1 Tbpsi. For that purpose, imprint mold equipped with 30-nm-pitch pillar pattern was formed on a Si substrate using diblock copolymer template. Room-temperature imprint and ion milling were applied to avoid thermal and chemical damage to magnetic film during a patterning process. The obtained aspect ratio of the relief by room-temperature imprint was enhanced via pattern-inverse process. After ionmilling treatment, 30-nm-pitch magnetic dot array with 20 nm height was observed. A nickel replica mold was formed by electroforming applying the Si mold as an original master. These results indicate the possibility that nanoimprinting is a practical method for 1 Tbpsi patterned media production.", "Directed polymer self-assembly which combines lithographically defined substrates and self-assembled polymers has been considered as a potential candidate to extend conventional patterning techniques. In the past few years, successful demonstration of directed self-assembly of block copolymer shows that this method can afford sub-lithographic resolution or enhances dimensional control. However, integration of polymer self-assembly into standard lithographic processes remains a challenge and requires new materials. In this paper, we demonstrate robust and thermally crosslinked underlayer materials which control the orientation of block copolymer assemblies and are compatible with standard lithographic processes. These new materials allow simple integration of perpendicularly oriented polystyrene-b- polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) domains into standard manufacturing processes.", "Material properties and directed self-assembly of a block copolymer containing hybrid material are presented in this paper. The hybrid material, which is a mixture of poly(styrene-b-ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) and organosilicate (OS), shows morphologies of microdomains similar to those of organic diblock copolymers depending on the fraction of each phase, i.e. PS and PEO+OS. This material system shows very strong segregation between phases, which provides well defined microdomains in thin films even right after spin coating. The strong segregation also makes it possible to generate microdomains of sub-10 nm length scale regime. The hybrid is found to be directed self-assembly (DSA)- friendly, thus typical topographic and/or chemical guiding patterns can be used for DSA of the hybrid.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of a block copolymer containing hybrid material using topographic guiding patterns is presented in this paper. Lamellar microdomains of the hybrid material, which is a mixture of poly(styrene-b-ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) and organosilicate (OS) precursor, have orientational correlation length about five times longer than typical organic block copolymers such as poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA). The longer correlation length (i.e. bigger grain size) makes it possible to align the lamellar microdomain into geometries similar to device layouts. We report one-dimensional assembly of lamellar microdomains on substrates, which gives crossbar and multifinger nanostructures.", "We design a C-shaped aperture which overcomes the diffraction limit of light to produce a high-brightness nano-size light spot. For optical nano lithography, we construct a nano patterning system using an optical probe which adopts a solid immersion lens (SIL), the 120 nm thickness aluminum film on the bottom surface of the SIL and the C-shaped aperture engraved in the metal film. Light source is a diode laser of 405nm wavelength to expose h-line photoresist(PR). A linear stage holding the optical probe makes the nano aperture contact with the PR coated on silicon wafer. Using this patterning system, we obtain sub 100nm array patterns and measure the system performance in various exposure conditions to verify the feasibility of plasmonic lithography.", "An etch-less ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL) process is proposed for patterning a photonic crystal (PC) structure onto an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) substrate. In a conventional UV-NIL, anisotropic etching is used to remove the residual layers and to transfer the patterns onto the substrate. The proposed process does not require an etching process. In the process, a stamp with nano-scale PC patterns is pressed on the dispensed resin and UV light is then exposed to cure the resin. After tens of seconds, the stamp is separated from the patterned polymer layer on the substrate. Finally, high-refractive index material is coated onto the layer. The refractive index of the polymer should be very similar to that of glass. The enhancement of the light extraction was assessed by the three-dimensional (3D) finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The OLED was integrated on a nanoimprinted substrate and the electro-luminance intensity was found to have increased by as much as 50% compared to a conventional device.", "We describe a technique whereby photolithography has been extended to the patterning of near micron-scale features onto grossly non-planar substrates. Examples will be given of track widths down to ten microns patterned over surfaces with vertical dimensions in excess of one centimetre - far outside the normal bounds of photolithography. The technique enables many novel microsystem packaging schemes and provides an alternative to the direct-write methods that are traditionally employed for patterning non-planar surfaces. The technique is based on the computation of the phase/amplitude distribution on the mask that, when illuminated with light of sufficient spatial coherence, will recreate the desired non-planar light distribution. This has some similarities to existing RET and inverse lithography techniques, but is extended to grossly non-planar surfaces. Exposure of an electrophoretic photoresist-coated substrate to the light field created by the mask enables the non-planar pattern to be transferred to the substrate. The holographic mask contains localized Fresnel patterns. We discuss the analytical methods used for their computation, the approximations necessary to enable mask manufacture and the effects of these approximations on image quality. We also discuss more general numerical methods of mask computation.", "In this paper we report the use of projection optical lithography to pattern micron-sized features on 100 \u03bcm thick PEN foils. A foil-on-carrier lamination process was developed to ensure a good dimensional stability during the lithographic processing and imaging of the foil. A stepper based leveling metrology was used in characterizing the surface flatness of the foil-on-carriers. A lithography process was developed to image micron and submicron patterns on foil substrates. The process window for 1-10 \u03bcm features was determined from focus and exposure energy experiments. The lithographic study indicated a reproducible and excellent imaging accuracy for patterning micron-sized features on flexible substrates. This makes the technology very suitable for the manufacturing of electronic devices with critical dimensions in the micron and submicron range. In addition, we made transistors-on-foil demonstrators with the developed foil-on-carrier lamination and imaging technology.", "Nanoimprint Lithography appears to be a competitive candidate for Next Generation Lithography in semiconductor industry due to its advantages concerning resolution and cost effectiveness. Moreover, UV-Nanoimprint Lithography (UV-NIL) should enable to reach good overlay values, which is also a major criterion for integration. In this paper, we present first integration results which were obtained on lines and contact holes. A specific template was designed for this purpose in collaboration with CEA-LETI, IMS and Molecular Imprints. This template was characterized by using various techniques (optical and SEM techniques) and showed quite a good quality of the template; in particular, 50 nm holes were defined. Molecular Imprints process was then tested by using Imprio55\u00ae at MESA+ Research Institute, University of Twente (Netherlands). In these experiments, 37 4.8 cm2 fields were imprinted on Double Side Polished wafers. For each field, 52 droplets were dispensed with various volumes. Resolution and non-uniformity were evaluated after imprinting. Then etching tests were performed.", "We are now investigating a new concept column with the 3rd-order imaging technique, in order to obtain fine resolution and high current density beams for electron beam direct writing (EBDW) suitable for below 32nm technology nodes. From the first experimental verification, it is found that the 3rd-order imaging has a benefit of increasing the beam current compared with conventional Gaussian beam without any beam blurring. However, in order to realize such a column which can work stably in the sub 32nm technology node generations, it is important to clarify how robust the 3rd-order imaging is against the mechanical tolerances in column manufacturing. This paper describes the tolerance analysis for errors of column manufacturing by simulation. The column has an electron gun with small virtual source and two (Gun and Main) lenses. A patterned beam defining aperture, which enables the 3rd-order imaging, is set between the 1st and the 2nd lenses. The influences of errors such as concentricity, offset and tilt between optical parts on the beam shape, beam current density distribution, and beam edge acuity on a wafer is analyzed for this column. According to these results, the 3rd-order imaging appears to have sufficiently large allowance compared to the error budget for column manufacturing required in the sub 32nm technology node patterning.", "It is commonly known that maskless lithography is the most effective technology to reduce costs and shorten the time need for recent photo-mask making techniques. In mass production, however, lithography using photo-masks is used because that method has high productivity. Therefore a solution is to use maskless lithography to make prototypes and use optical lithography for volume production. On the other hand, using an exposure technology that is different from that used for mass production causes different physical phenomena to occur in the lithography process, and different images are formed. These differences have an effect on the characteristics of the semiconductor device being made. An issue arises because the chip characteristics are different for the sample chip and the final chip of the same product. This issue also requires other processes to be changed besides switching to the lithography process. In our previous paper, we reported on new developments in an electron-beam exposure data-generating system for making printed images of a different exposure source correspond to each other in lithographic printing systems, which are electron beam lithography and photolithography. In this paper, we discuss whether the feasibility of this methodology has been demonstrated for use in a production environment. Patterns which are generated with our method are complicated. To apply the method to a production environment we needed a breakthrough, and we overcame some difficult issues.", "We present our work on using one level of templated self-assembly using 70:30::PS-b-PMMA. Focus is on the fabrication of top-gated silicon MOSFETs and simple circuits. The potential choice as a first demonstration is to use 70:30::PS-b-PMMA to define the contact holes of MOSFETs. Contact holes make a good starting point because of both their size and repetition in view of today's design. We have presented our work of solving half-hole problem when adopting templated selfassembly. Results of transferring the self-assembled holes from the polymer mask to a silicon dioxide layer by plasma etching and filling the etched holes in silicon dioxide with aspect ratio of approximately one to three are presented. Potential integration issues for making MOSFETs will also be addressed.", "A vertical double gate MOSFET (FinFET) device with an ultra-small poly-Si gate of 30nm and promising device performances has been successfully developed after integrating a 14\u00c5 nitrided gate oxide on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. First, a 500\u00c5-thick TEOS capping oxide layer was deposited upon a 1000\u00c5-thick poly-Si gate layer. Second, both 1050\u00c5-thick bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) and 2650\u00c5-thick photoresist (PR) were coated. A deep ultra-violet (DUV) 193nm wavelength ASML scanner lithography tool was used for the ultra-small poly-Si layout patterning under high energy exposure. After an organic-based trimming down plasma etching of both PR and BARC, the TEOS capping oxide layer was plasma etched in another oxide-based etching chambers without breaking the plasma etcher's loadlock vacuum. Then, without removing the already plasma patterned and trim-downed PR and BARC, an in-situ PR/BARC and TEOS hard mask etching was rendered for the final 1000\u00c5-thick poly-Si gate electrode. The poly-Si etching can be automatically stopped by setting the over-time etching mode to a few seconds after detecting the endpoint signal of the bottom buried oxide (BOX) insulating layer. Finally, after PR and BARC plasma as well as additional wet cleaning, an ultra-narrow poly-Si gate electrode, i.e., after etching inspection (AEI) of 30nm, with its capping TEOS hard mask was successfully fabricated.", "With the development of a CMOS Image Sensor (CIS), the pixel size of a CIS is continuously decreasing. It makes the photo diode smaller and smaller in the unit pixel and, as a result, the sensitivity is reduced at the same time. A micro lens (ML) is added to improve the sensitivity of CIS. The size of ML is reduced with the pixel size and it almost arrived at the limitation of the size which is governed by diffraction. In this paper, we simulate the diffraction feature of a ML with an electro-magnetic wave simulation. The efficiency and the crosstalk of some ML which have a size near the diffraction limit are calculated and compared. From the simulation result, we suggest a guide line of the ML design.", "Scattering resulting from interface imperfections crucially affects the throughput and image contrast of EUV optics. Since both the substrate finish and the intrinsic thin film roughness influence the scattering, thorough investigations are needed to separate the different effects and to identify the most promising starting points for further optimizations. Mo/Si multilayer coatings deposited onto different substrates are investigated by utilizing an instrument for EUV reflectance and scattering measurements at 13.5 nm recently developed at the Fraunhofer IOF. The influences of the substrate finish and the deposition process onto the scattering are separated. Furthermore, the instrument allowed the EUV-induced degradation of Mo/Si mirrors to be investigated at the wavelength of application. In particular the impact of top-layer oxidation and roughening on the scattering properties is discussed.", "Extreme Ultraviolet Interferometric lithography (EUV-IL) can generate periodic patterns useful to characterize photoresist materials and to create templates for self-assembled geometries. The Center for NanoTechnology has developed a novel EUV-IL beamline dedicated to nanopatterning using radiation from an undulator on the Aladdin storage ring at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The beamline and the EUV-IL system were commissioned in 2006; we have completed several characterization studies, and modified several key components to improve resolution and usability. The EUV-IL system can expose different pitches at the same time producing patterns with a range of halfpitch from 55nm down to 20nm and less on the wafer. We can also introduce a variable image modulation by performing double exposures, overlapping the interference pattern with the transmitted zero order. Recently we have demonstrated down to 20nm half-pitch printed IL image in PMMA resist.", "Wafer throughput and particle counts are key metrics for any semiconductor manufacturer's yield enhancement programs. Recent advancements in diffuser technology have helped manufacturers enhance these metrics while improving the attributes for most vacuum processes. These processes include dry etch, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), rapid thermal processing (RTP) and Epitaxial deposition (Epi). Execution of membrane diffuser technology dramatically decreases required vent time and has become a highly effective tool upgrade option. An early implementation of this technology was used on 200mm batch-style loadlocks that had an inherently large internal volume. The loadlock was prone to long vent cycles to prevent particle contamination. As the industry transitioned to a 300mm wafer platform, factories increased their development of single-wafer loadlocks (SWLL) in an effort to boost tool throughput. Gas diffusers with ultra fine filtration membranes solved these issues. Compared to the 200mm batch-style loadlocks, the SWLLs had extremely low internal volumes and were designed to cycle vacuum to atmosphere very quickly. With the low volumes inherent in the SWLL, the velocity of the incoming vent gas became critical, since any particles on the bottom of the loadlock chamber would easily sweep onto the wafer should they be hit with a high velocity gas. Particles are typically present in the loadlock due to mechanical wafer handling devices and environmental exposure. Gas diffusers allowed a large, uniform volumetric flowrate of gas into the loadlock chamber at low downstream gas velocities. While now standard on most 300mm loadlocks, the majority of 200mm tools in the field do not utilize membrane diffusers. Typically a screen, frit and/or soft vent procedure is used to control the flow into the loadlock. However, these tools can now be retrofitted with membrane diffuser technology. The result is a large reduction in particle count while maintaining throughput levels at a low cost with minimal downtime.", "EUV emission from spherical and planer targets were precisely characterized as an experimental database for use in EUV source generation at high repetition rates. In the single-shot base experiments, conversion efficiency as high as those for the plasma geometry has been demonstrated. The integrated experiment was made with 10 Hz plasma generation.", "The wavefront measurements have been performed with the EUV Wavefront Metrology System (EWMS) for the first time using a prototype projection optic as a test optic. The wavefronts of the test optic was measured at the five positions in the exposure field with the Digital Talbot Interferometer (DTI). The RMS magnitude of the wavefront errors ranged from 0.71 \u03bb (9.58 nm) to 1.67 \u03bb (22.75 nm). The results obtained with the DTI were compared to those with the Cross Grating Lateral Shearing Interferometer (CGLSI). As a result of a repeatability assessment, it was found that the EWMS can stably measure the wavefronts of the test optic. Additionally, unwrapping of the phase map was found to be related to the precision of the measurement.", "We have installed a small-field exposure tool (SFET) manufactured by Canon and EUVA with a discharge-producedplasma EUV source that employs Xenon gas. We investigated how the performance of the source affects lithographic performance. Electrode life has relation to the illumination uniformity of the exposure field on wafer surface. Also source power at the wafer surface has relation to the electrode life. Electrode life makes EUV power decreasing and larger illumination uniformity number. We examine the pupilgram test using high sensitivity resist. Actual pupil fill shape was observed and there was non-uniform distribution. Pupil fill shape was changed after exchanging electrode, also resist CD bias between parallel and horizontal line of the field. That was comparable to the simulation result. The source electrode requires periodic replacement, which impacts not only the performance of the source, but also the lithographic performance of the tool, such as the CD of resist patterns.", "In the present paper, we overview fabrication methods to produce density-controlled tin and xenon targets for generating extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light. The target can be classified as a mass-limited target. In the case of tin, EUV was relatively monochromatic, and its conversion efficiency was higher than bulk tin. Using the nano-template method, the cellular foam size was controlled by the template size. The density was 0.5 ~1.5 g/cm3. In the case of the 0.5 g/cm3 foam, its morphology was controlled by changing the ethanol content of the precursor tin solution. The morphology difference was useful to control the angular distribution of EUV radiation. SnO2 nanofiber, which is oriented low-density material, was fabricated continuously using a electrospinning method. The width and the shape of the fiber were controlled by optimizing precursor solution. A transparent film with tin and SnO2 elliptic spheres were prepared using liquid crystalline cellulose derivative. Low density xenon was prepared from liquid xenon using a swirl atomizer to produce a density of 0.2 g/cm3.", "Debris characteristics and its reduction have been investigated for a laser-produced plasma (LPP) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source using a colloidal jet target containing tin dioxide nano-particles. Dominant deposited debris on a witness plate was found to have a form of oxidized tin (SnOx) originated from nano-particles. Quantitative debris amounts were determined by total laser energy irradiated onto a target, not by laser irradiation modes, such as single or double pulse irradiation. In-situ low-temperature (100\u00b0C) heating of a plate was effective to reduce the deposited debris amount, since colloidal debris was easily vaporized by the heat. Another approach to remove the deposited debris was roomtemperature photon processing using incoherent vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) emission at 126 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis has shown that the deposited SnOx debris layer was deoxidized by the 126 nm VUV photon energy.", "We evaluated the characteristics of Sn debris generated by a CO2 laser (10.6\u03bcm) produced plasma. Experiments were performed with bulk Sn-plate targets and Mo/Si multilayer mirror samples were used for debris analysis. We observed very thin and uniform Sn layers of nano/sub-nano size debris particles. The layer deposition rate at 120mm from the plasma is, without magnetic field, about 30nm per million shots. The fundamental magnetic field effect has been confirmed experimentally. The fast Sn ion flux was measured with Faraday cups and the signal decreased by more than 3 orders of magnitude applying a magnetic field of 1T. The Sn deposition on the Mo/Si multilayer mirror decreased in this case by a factor of 4. The contribution of the remaining neutral Sn particles is under study in order to decrease the deposition rate.", "We are developing a Sn droplet generator for a LPP HVM EUV light source. Droplet trains with frequencies up to 500kHz and droplet diameters below 20um are generated via the continuous jet method. Charging single droplets and using deflector electrodes these charged droplets are selected from the droplet train and irradiated by the drive laser. Due to the small droplet diameter, the drive laser otherwise irradiates several droplets inside the droplet train thus increasing the Sn debris as is experimentally shown. In addition, the paper outlines that a 30um droplet size is the mass limit for up to 180W EUV generation based on the assumption that each Sn atom emits on average a single in-band photon.", "We are developing a high power CO2 laser system for a LPP EUV light source. Recent theoretical and experimental data demonstrate the advantages of the combination of a CO2 laser with a Sn target including the generation of a high CE and low debris plasma with low energy ions and low out-of-band radiation. Our laser system is a short pulse CO2 MOPA (Master Oscillator Power Amplifier) system with 22 ns pulse width and multi kW average power at 100 kHz repetition rate. We achieved an average laser power of 8 kW with a single laser beam having very good beam quality. A EUV in-band power of 60 W at the intermediate focus was generated irradiating a rotating tin plate with 6 kW laser power.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is a potential candidate for the next generation lithography techniques, which will use Xe or Sn as a main fuel to produce EUV light. However, the industry has favored to use Sn as main fuel in EUVL systems because of its high conversion efficiency over Xe. Sn has an advantage of producing more light, but on the other hand its condensable nature is a real threat to the reflective mirrors which are used to collect the EUV light at intermediate focus. Center for Plasma Material Interactions (CPMI) at the University of Illinois has studied plasma etching as a potential method of Sn removal from collector optics. RF-driven chlorine plasma is used to etch Sn from mirror samples. Previously we reported high selectivity of Sn over several EUV compatible mirror materials. The increased confidence in this technology had led us to perform cleaning experiments on real Sn contaminated samples exposed in an EUV source and the results obtained have been very encouraging. Small mock up shells (same as in the grazing incidence collector optics system) were constructed at CPMI and chlorine etching was performed at different samples placed at different locations on multi-shell collector mock up in ICP-RIE chamber. Post cleaning material characterization results of samples shows that chlorine can potentially clean Sn off of collector optics (Ru was used in this study as a mirror sample). Realizing this as a viable cleaning solution, we have stepped further and performed a full size cleaning test in the Xtreme's XTS 13-35 EUV source. Large mock up with appropriate dimension was placed in the EUV source chamber and the cleaning system was installed to etch Sn away from Ru surface. This study compares the cleaning results in a real system scale with the previous simulated system. The comparison shows how to improve the Sn cleaning system in the EUV source chamber. Results are encouraging and may enable source suppliers to integrate this technology in their respective sources. Cleaning rate was measured as >100nm/min using ion sputtered Sn samples.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is a leading candidate for use in next-generation high volume manufacturing of semiconductor chips that require feature sizes less than 32 nm. The essential requirement for enabling this technology is to have a reliable, clean and powerful EUV source which efficiently emits light at a wavelength of 13.5 nm. Laser-produced plasma EUV sources are strong candidates for use in EUVL light source systems. The development and optimization of high-efficiency EUV sources requires not only well-diagnosed experiments, but also a good understanding of the physical processes affecting the emitting plasma, which can be achieved with the help of accurate numerical simulation tools. Here, we investigate the radiative properties of tin and tin-doped foam plasmas heated by 1.06 \u03bcm laser beams with 10 ns pulse widths. Results from simulations are compared with experimental conversion efficiencies and emission spectra.", "Through its participation to European programs, SAGEM has worked on the design and manufacturing of normal incidence collectors for EUV sources. By opposition to grazing incidence, normal incidence collectors are expected to collect more light with a simpler and cheaper design. Designs are presented for the two current types of existing sources: Discharge Produced Plasma (DPP) and Laser Produced Plasma (LPP). Collection efficiency is calculated in both cases. It is shown that these collectors can achieve about 10 % efficiency for DPP sources and 40 % for LPP sources. SAGEM works on the collectors manufacturability are also presented, including polishing, coating and cooling. The feasibility of polishing has been demonstrated with a roughness better than 2 angstroms obtained on several materials (glass, silicon, Silicon Carbide, metals...). SAGEM is currently working with the Institut d'Optique and the Laboratoire des Materiaux Avanc\u00e9s on the design and the process of EUV coatings for large mirrors. Lastly, SAGEM has studied the design and feasibility of an efficient thermal control, based on a liquid cooling through slim channels machined close to the optical surface.", "One of the remaining challenges for the commercialization of EUV lithography is the lifetime of the Mo/Si multilayer optics and masks. The lifetime is dominated by carbon contamination on the surfaces of the optics, which is caused by residual hydrocarbons in the vacuum chamber when optics are exposed to EUV radiation. One of the possible sources of the hydrocarbons in the chamber is resist outgassing. To be able to understand which type of hydrocarbons are harmful to EUV mirror reflectivity, three hydrocarbon species - benzene, tert-butanol and diphenyl sulfide - which are thought to be representative of commonly outgassed species from EUV photoresist were selected. The goal of this work was to measure the contamination rate from these three species and to be able to draw conclusions about other species. The results of the experiments showed that after 8 hours of exposure there was not enough contamination to be significantly measurable. In addition to these hydrocarbon species, we also used vacuum grease and carbon tape as an outgassing source for hydrocarbons. Comparatively, high contamination rates were achieved with vacuum grease and carbon tape.", "Debris generation in EUV sources is a real threat to the lifetime of collector optics. Debris measurements in these sources are of immense importance to enable source suppliers to estimate collector lifetime. Ion debris measurements performed so far are not consistent and in part incomplete. To verify lifetime claims from different EUV source suppliers, SEMATECH, which is leading this investigation, has collaborated with and provided funding to the Center for Plasma Material Interactions (CPMI) at the University of Illinois to build a fully calibrated and standardized spherical sector electrostatic energy analyzer (ICE). This device is capable of measuring ion debris flux in absolute units. In addition to ion flux, the detector is also capable of identifying different ion species present in the plasma, which can be discriminated based on energy-to-charge ratio. The lifetime of collector optics is calculated using the measured ion flux. This device was fabricated for SEMATECH with the sole aim of traveling to different EUV source suppliers' sites around the world and collecting ion debris data. SEMATECH has measured ion debris from different EUV sources around the world, using a 1 to 14keV ion energy range under different source operational conditions (chamber pressure, pinch frequency, pinch power, angle). These measurements identify the need for debris mitigation in all the EUV sources investigated under this project. They also give source suppliers an opportunity to improve and optimize the performance of their respective sources. The information on absolute ion fluxes is an advantage to source suppliers, allowing them to design and develop effective debris mitigation schemes, which can again be tested for their effectiveness using the ion diagnostic tool. As the debris consists of ions and neutrals, the next logical step is to develop a standardized neutral detector to measure the flux and energy distribution of neutrals present in EUV plasma sources. Taking into account both ions and neutral fluxes, more definitive conclusions on the performance of a EUV source can be made and better collector lifetime estimation models can be derived. The Illinois Calibrated ESA (ICE) tool is now part of the SEMATECH \"Flying Circus\" equipment set.", "One of present EUVL challenges is to reduce as much as possible the organic compounds and water partial pressures during the lithographic process. These gases can in fact interact with sensitive surfaces and, in the presence of EUV radiation, decompose to generate carbon-based films and oxides, which are detrimental to the optics, reducing its performance, lifetime and significantly increasing the equipment total cost of ownership. With this respect, use of Non Evaporable Getter (NEG) pumps seems particularly attractive. Getter pumps are very clean, vibration-free, compact, able to deliver large pumping speed for all active gases, including water and hydrogen. In the present paper, we report for the first time the results of specific tests aimed at measuring the pumping speed for some selected organic compounds, namely toluene and decane (n-decane). The study shows that getter pumps can effectively sorb these large organic molecules with high speed and capacity. Speed and capacity increases when operating the getter cartridge at moderate temperature (e.g. 150-200\u00b0C), however remarkable sorption is achieved, even at room temperature, without any power applied. When coupled with turbo-molecular pumps NEG pumps have therefore the potential to improve the ultimate vacuum and mitigate the carbon/oxygen contamination in a UHV lithographic system.", "The lifetime and the efficiency of EUV source collector optics will have direct impact on the cost effectiveness of the EUV lithography semiconductor production. Therefore the collector optics was identified as a critical issue in EUVL. To continually improve and optimize the source collector optics precise measurements of the optics characteristics are required as well as life time studies. Adequate measuring equipment must be designed to perform these measurements on-site, at-wavelength and under realistic conditions. Moreover, the measurement accuracy must be sufficient to allow the detection of small changes in reflectivity and homogeneity of the EUV source collector optics. This makes it possible to predict the lifetime of an EUV source collector operated with a high power EUV source after a fraction of the specified pulse number, e.g. after a couple of hours. A reflectometer for the investigation of full EUV source collectors was developed, designed and set up. As an EUV source a commercial microfocus EUV tube was used. This source is particularly suitable for application in metrology, as it is very stable in its output parameters (namely power, spectrum, spot size, spot position), and it does not emit debris. The radiation cone emitted by the EUV source is tailored with a Schwarzschild objective to the spectral and geometrical requirements of the Wolter-shell EUV source collector optics At the time of this contribution the measurement system presented here is in operation since 18 months, and a large number of collector measurements was performed. It is used for the quality control of factory-new EUV source collectors as well as for repeated measurements within the context of lifetime tests. With this device the efficiency of debris filters, which prevent the EUV source collector optics from contamination, could be determined and improved. The concept of the device and the implementation together with measurement results are described.", "It is very important to mitigate oxidation of multilayer mirrors (MLMs) and carbon deposition onto MLMs to extend the lifetime of EUV exposure tool. We focused on carbon deposition on Si-capped multilayer mirror. We made experiments of EUV irradiation to the multilayer mirrors using an EUV irradiation apparatus connected to a beam line (SBL -2) of synchrotron radiation facility Super-ALIS in the NTT Atsugi research and development center. Thickness of deposited carbon was obtained by using XPS. We investigated carbon deposition rates at various partial pressures of various organic species. Phenomenological analysis was applied to the obtained carbon deposition rate. Carbon deposition rate was proportional to the pressure at the proportional EUV intensity. Applying this normalization of the deposition rate and the EUV intensity, carbon deposition rate seems to behave according to each universal function for each hydrocarbon species.", "We investigated the protection of a Ru-capped Mo/Si multilayer from surface oxidation under exposure to EUV radiation in the presence of water vapor and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Degradation of the reflectance of the Ru-capped Mo/Si multilayer by EUV irradiation was controlled by introducing IPA gas. We also investigated the reduction effect of the oxide layer in a multilayer mirror by introducing ethanol and exposed EUV. The Ru-capped multilayer sample was exposed to EUV radiation in the presence of only water vapor to oxidize its surface. The reflectance decreased by about 1.5%. Then the sample was exposed to EUV radiation in the presence of only ethanol vapor. The reflectivity of the sample was recovered to +0.5%, and the atomic concentration of oxygen in the irradiated area was decreased by EUV irradiation in the presence of ethanol.", "The selection of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light as the next generation lithography light source as been a natural progression of the development in the semiconductor industry based on past history of chip size and the projection of where chip sizes will go. The sources of EUV light convert about 1-4% of net deposited plasma energy into photons between 13-14 nm, the remaining energy generates out of band radiation and the production of highly energetic ions and neutrals in the dense hot plasma that move outwards in all directions. A fraction of these ions strike electrode surfaces, injection nozzles, and the vacuum chamber producing low-energy sputtered atoms termed debris. There are limitations to various mitigation schemes and some debris will still reach the collector optics. As such, the mechanism and ability of Li removal from the collector like optics needs to be studied and modeled to be able to provide a predictive value for lifetime of the optics. This removal can be accomplished with the presence of a secondary helium plasma which can selectively sputter lithium from the collector optic surface while providing high EUV photon transmission and have the advantage of being a nondestructive in situ cleaning method for the collector optics. This will allow development of long lasting collector optics and operating regimes in addition to expanding the knowledge base about lithium transport and interaction. First, a lithium magnetron source was developed to provide low energy lithium debris like that which is present in EUV sources. This magnetron was plasma was characterized through the use Langmuir probe analysis to yield a mapping of the temperature and density of the plasma, in addition to the ionization fraction. From here, a secondary helium plasma source was developed, employed, and studied in the same manner to also provide information on the electron density, temperature, and ionization fraction so as to accurately model and measure the deposition flux of lithium and sputter flux of helium on the sample surface. The model correlated well to experimental observations. The development of a model of simultaneous lithium deposition and evaporation in the presence of a secondary plasma held below the lithium sputtering threshold was well correlated to experimental observations. Finally, the simultaneous process of deposition, evaporation, and sputtering of lithium was modeled and corroborated with experimental observations such that no net deposition on the collector optic was measured. This lends the model to being available model was developed that can be used for predictive scenarios involving deposition, evaporation, and sputtering are undertaken. This work, while relevant for the commercial EUVL community, is relevant in physics for applications involving plasma physics, plasma material interactions, magnetron sputtering, solid metal sputtering, liquid metal sputtering, liquid metal evaporation, soft x-ray optics, and modeling of these interactions.", "We characterize the interaction of ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH) vapor with a crystalline Ru(1010) surface, a model surface for Ru capping layers used for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) optics. Our main objective is to provide fundamental insights into the basic physical processes that affect the reflectivity of Ru-coated Mo/Si multilayer EUV mirrors that are exposed to EUV radiation. While ethanol has been used previously as a gaseous hydrocarbon in EUV mirror lifetime tests, there appear to be no published reports describing the basic surface chemistry of ethanol on Ru. We use ultrahigh vacuum surface science methods, and find that fractional monolayers (ML) of ethanol dissociate almost completely on clean Ru(1010); H2 and CO desorb upon heating to ~500 K, and leave a fractional ML of carbon on the surface. At coverages greater than a few tenths of a ML, ethanol desorbs in molecular form at temperatures below 300 K. Weakly chemisorbed ethanol in the first ML desorbs at ~210 K with a binding energy of 0.55 eV. Multilayer ethanol desorbs at ~155 K. Repeated dosing of ethanol followed by heating to ~600 K causes accumulation of a carbon monolayer which becomes unreactive to ethanol. Also, we find that an oxygen monolayer is unreactive, with little or no dissociation of ethanol observed. Electron bombardment of Ru at 300 K in 5\u00d710-8 Torr ethanol can lead to accumulation of a carbon film >1nm thick.", "The reactivity of prospective capping layer extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mirror materials with hydrocarbons, alcohols, and water is studied in the gas phase using mass spectroscopy of metal-oxide clusters. We report the results of chemistry studies for Si, Ti, Hf, Zr, and Ru metal oxide nanoclusters in which the reaction products were ionized with little or no fragmentation by 26.5 eV photons from a desk-top size 46.9 nm Ne-like Ar laser. Hf and Zr oxides are found to be much less reactive than Si or Ti oxides in the presence EUV light. Ru oxides show different chemistry and are inactive with water/alcohols, and active with saturated/unsaturated hydrocarbons. The results are relevant to the design of EUV mirror capping layers that are resistant to carbon contamination.", "Particle contamination is analyzed for a reticle in the inner pod of a carrier with particular emphasis on the effect of raising the cover of the inner pod before removing the reticle from the carrier at atmospheric pressure (not low pressure). Two mechanisms for particle transport into the gap between the base plate and the reticle are considered: injection and advection-diffusion. It is shown that injection is not an important mechanism but that advection-diffusion transport can carry particles deeply into the gap, where they can deposit on the reticle surface. Closed-form expressions are presented for the transmission probability that particles at the reticle edge are transported inward past the exclusion zone around the reticle perimeter. The gas flow in the gap that occurs during cover-raising is found by numerical simulation, and the closed-form expressions are applied to determine the probability of contamination for different cover-raising scenarios.", "Flare degrades critical-dimension (CD) control in EUVL, a promising technology for the 32-nm half-pitch node. To deal with flare, high-quality projection optics in the exposure tool and flare variation compensation (FVC) technology with proper mask resizing are needed. Selete has installed a small-field exposure tool (SFET) with the goal of assessing resist performance. Due to the high-quality optics, the SFET allowed us to determine the required flare specification to be 6.1% or 6.6%, as calculated from the residual part of the low- or middle-frequency region, respectively. The flare level was confirmed through experimental results and from calculations using the power spectral density (PSD) obtained from the mirror roughness by the disappearing-resist method. The lithographic performance was evaluated using 32-nm-halfpitch patterns in a new resist. The resist characteristics can be explained by modeling blur as a Gaussian function with a \u03c3 of 8.8 nm and using a very accurate CD variation (< ~6 nm) obtained by taking into account the influences of mask CD error and flare on evaluation patterns. Since FVC is needed to obtain flare characteristics that do not degrade the CD, we used the double-exposure method to eliminate the influence of errors, including nonuniform dose distribution and CD mask error. Regardless of whether there was an open area or not, there was no difference in CD as a function of distance up to a distance of 20 \u00b5m. In addition, CD degradation was observed at distances not far (< 5 \u00b5m) from the open area. In a 60-nm neighborhood of the open area, an 8-nm variation in CD appeared up to the distance at which the CD leveled off. When the influences of resist blur and flare on patterns was taken into account in the calculation, it was found that aerial simulations based on a rigorous 3D model of a mask structure matched the experimental results. These results yield the appropriate mask resizing and the range in which flare has an influence, which is needed for FVC. This research was supported in part by NEDO.", "It is well known from 193nm simulation studies that accounting for the electromagnetic (EM) interaction between the incident light and the mask become more important as the mask geometry shrinks. In particular this transition occurs when the size of the mask pattern becomes comparable to the wavelength of light. Early simulation work in EUV lithography indicated rigorous EM calculations are required to predict the subtle effects associated with the mask absorber shadowing effect. These calculations generally show that non-normal mask incidence creates several problems, including HV-bias, slit position dependent bias, and slit position dependent pattern shift. These results are surprising because the mask sizes studied are much larger than the 13.5nm wavelength. If approximate methods could be used rather than the rigorous EM calculations then EUV simulations would be much faster and more accessible. In this study, rigorous EM simulation results are compared with a Kirchoff approximation. The results show that Kirchoff simulations can mimic the shadowing effect with a simple mask bias. It is also found that the pattern shift effect is an artifact caused by a misinterpretation of the rigorous simulation results. With proper biasing depending on the pattern orientation and field position, simple Kirchoff simulation can be used. Thus Any MBOPC tool currently available can handle EUV proximity correction with minor modifications.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resist development has been enabled over the past few years in large part by high numerical aperture (NA) exposure tools such as the 0.3-NA microfield exposure tools (METs) at SEMATECH and Intel. Of these tools, the SEMATECH Berkeley MET tool is unique in its ability to provide lossless pupil fill control enabling extremely low k1 printing (down to 0.25). It is well known that illumination settings can be tailored to optimize printing performance for particular features. The optimal illumination settings, however, depend not only on the feature type but also on the specifics of the pupil function, including phase (or aberrations) and amplitude (or pupil obscurations). Here, aerial image modeling is used to study the optimal illumination conditions for the SEMATECH Berkeley MET tool as a function of feature size and type. The modeling accounts for the known pupil function (amplitude and phase) of the optic.", "In order to continue the trend toward smaller feature sizes in lithography, new methods of lithography will be needed. A likely method for printing features 32 nm and smaller is extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. EUV allows for features to be printed that are smaller than the current methods can achieve. However, outgassing of the photoresist is a concern for EUV lithography. The outgassed components can lead to contamination of the optics, degrading the reflectivity and hence lowering throughput of the exposure tools. Outgassing due to EUV exposure has been investigated by many groups. However, there were no complete investigations available of vacuum induced outgassing. In this paper, several methods were employed to investigate the outgassing due to vacuum. It was found that the vacuum induced outgassing outgassed a similar number of molecules as the outgassing due to EUV exposure. Furthermore, almost all of the outgassing was completed after about two minutes in vacuum. To mitigate the potential concern of outgassing due to vacuum causing contamination of optics, this work shows that photoresist coated silicon wafers only require about two minutes of pumping prior to insertion near the optics within EUV lithography tools.", "A method to evaluate the sensitivity of photoresists used for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has been developed. EUV sources produce out-of-band radiation and the reflective optics used in EUV tools reflect some of this out-of-band light on the wafer plane. The effect of exposing these photoresists to this unwanted light can reduce the image contrast on the wafer, and thereby reduce the image quality of the printed images. To examine the wavelengths of light that may have an adverse effect on these resists, a deuterium light source mounted with a monochromator has been designed to determine how sensitive these photoresists are to light at selected wavelengths in the range 190-650 nm.", "With the commercialization of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography underway, there is considerable effort underway to improve EUV photoresists, so that they can meet the ITRS 2006 update requirements for resolution, line edge roughness and sensitivity. Nevertheless, the present limited availability of EUV exposure tools, and the high cost of such tools, has hampered the resist development effort. We have developed a simple, low-cost, technique to characterize different photoresist formulations for printing sub-100-nm features using EUV radiation. In the method presented here, a transmission mask is placed in close proximity to the resist sample and the resist is exposed through the mask. The mask used for this technique is a silicon nitride membrane with 50 nm gold layer which is patterned using a focused ion beam tool. The source for EUV light is a xenon based discharge plasma source from Energetiq. After developing, the resist images are measured in a scanning electron microscope to determine the feature size. Here we present results demonstrating sub-100 nm feature size using this method.", "Microfield exposure tools (METs) continue to play a dominant role in the development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resists. Here we present an update on the SEMATECH Berkeley 0.3-NA MET and summarize the latest test results from high-resolution line-space and contact-hole printing. In practice, the resolution limit of contact-hole printing is generally dominated by contact size variation that is often speculated to originate form shot noise effects. Such observations of photon-noise limited performance are concerning because they suggest that future increased resist sensitivity would not be feasible. Recent printing data, however, indicates that the contact size variation problem is currently not a result of shot noise but rather attributable to the mask in combination with the resist-dominated mask error enhancement factor (MEEF). Also discussed is the importance of the contribution of the system-level line-edge roughness (LER) to resist LER values currently obtained with the SEMATECH Berkeley MET. We present the expected magnitude of such effects and compare the results to observed trends in LER performance from EUV resists over the past few years.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is one of the leading candidates for next-generation lithography technology for the 32 nm half-pitch node and beyond. The availability of EUV resists is one of the most significant challenges facing its commercialization. A successful commercial EUV resist must simultaneously meet resolution, line width roughness (LWR), photosensitivity, and resist outgassing specifications. Photosensitivity is of particular concern because it couples directly to source power requirements and the source is widely viewed as the most daunting challenge facing EUV commercialization. To accelerate EUV resist development, SEMATECH has two programs that provide the resist community access to EUV exposure capability: 1) the EUV Resist Test Center (RTC) at SEMATECH at Albany, SUNY, and 2) the SEMATECH microexposure tool (MET) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. SEMATECH uses both facilities to benchmark EUV resists in close cooperation with resist suppliers. Here we summarize results from the SEMATECH EUV resist benchmarking project including process windows, exposure latitude, and depth of focus, photospeed, LWR, and ultimate resolution. Results show that EUV resists meet resolution and outgassing requirements for the 32nm half-pitch node. LWR and photospeed, however, remain a concern especially for contact-hole printing. Moreover, progress towards the 22nm half-pitch node has also been demonstrated in terms of resolvability.", "In this paper, we tried to fabricate a TiO2-doped SiO2 (TiO2-SiO2) glass ingot by the soot method, and homogenized the glass ingot by the zone-melting method. Homogeneities of the specimens were evaluated by measuring leaky surface acoustic wave (LSAW) velocity using the line-focus-beam ultrasonic material characterization system at 225 MHz. Two-dimensional LSAW velocity distributions having an average velocity of 3304.08 m/s with a maximum velocity difference of 3.85 m/s were measured for a homogenized specimen. Striae were not observed for the specimen. The velocity difference corresponds to 17.0 ppb/K from the sensitivity of the LSAW velocity to the CTE {4.41 (ppb/K)/(m/s)}. However, the velocity distributions excluding the edge parts were within \u00b11.13 m/s, corresponding to the CTE specification of \u00b15 ppb/K required for EUVL-grade glass. We also discussed the relationship between LSAW velocities and fictive temperatures by heat-treating a part of the homogenized specimen.", "In this paper, we suggest an optimal attenuated phase shift mask (PSM) structure for extreme ultra violet lithography (EUVL) to minimize mask shadowing effect without loss of image contrast. The attenuated PSM proposed in this study is based on Fabry-Perot structure that consists of tantalum nitride (TaN) attenuator, Al2O3 spacer, and molybdenum (Mo) phase shifter. Deep ultra violet (DUV) reflectivity can be lowered down to 5% at 257nm for higher efficiency in DUV inspection process through the optimal thickness combination of TaN and Al2O3. Since the thickness variation of Mo dose not affect the DUV reflectivity, the phase shift effect can be controlled by Mo thickness only. As a result, attenuated PSM with phase shift of 180\u00b16\u00b0 and absorber reflectivity of 9.5% could be obtained. The total thickness of absorber stack is only 52nm. The analysis of aerial image was performed using SOLID-EUV simulation tool. The attenuated PSM showed steeper edge profile and higher image contrast compared to binary mask. Imaging properties including horizontal-vertical (H-V) critical dimension (CD) bias and pattern shift depending on both pattern size and process condition were compared to the binary mask using aerial image simulation. Attenuated PSM showed less H-V CD bias compared to that of binary mask. The 32nm dense pattern shows larger H-V CD bias than 45nm one due to larger shadowing of smaller pattern size. Especially, 32nm dense pattern at binary mask has very large H-V CD bias. The H-V CD bias was also affected by the change of focus. However, the H-V bias variation with defocus was below 1nm within the process latitude. We also obtained the result that the pattern shift is less sensitive than H-V CD bias with the optical property of absorber in EUVL.", "Scatterometry, the analysis of light diffracted from a periodic structure, is a versatile metrology for characterizing periodic structures, regarding critical dimension (CD) and other profile properties. For extreme ultraviolet (EUV) masks, only EUV radiation provides direct information on the mask performance comparable to the operating regime in an EUV lithography tool. With respect to the small feature dimensions on EUV masks, the short wavelength of EUV is also advantageous since it increases the sensitivity for small structural details. Measurements using PTB's EUV reflectometer at the storage ring BESSY II showed that it is feasible to derive information on the absorber line profile in periodic areas of lines and spaces by means of rigorous numerical modeling with the finite element method (FEM). A prototype EUV mask with fields of nominally identical lines was used for the measurements. In this contribution we correlate the scatterometry data to CD-SEM and surface nano probe measurements of the line profiles as provided by the mask supplier. We discuss status of the determination of CD and side-wall geometry by scatterometry using rigorous FEM calculations of EUV diffraction and directions for further investigations.", "\"Reticle protection during storage, handling and use\" is one of the critical issues of EUV lithography because no practical pellicle has been found for EUV reticles as yet. The front surface of an EUV reticle has to be protected from particles larger than 20-30 nm to maintain the image quality on the wafer plane, and the backside also has to be protected to maintain the flatness of the reticle chucked on an electrostatic chuck (ESC). In this paper, we are focusing on particles on the backside of the reticle. If a particle lies between the reticle and the chuck, it has a strong impact on the flatness of the reticle, and the wafer overlay is degraded by out-of-plane distortion (OPD) and in-plane distortion (IPD) due to the particle1-5. From this point of view, we need to know the maximum permissible size of particles on the backside of the reticle. MIRAI-Selete introduced an experimental setup that can measure the flatness of the chucked reticle in a vacuum. An electrostatic chuck is installed in the vacuum chamber of Mask Protection Engineering Tool (MPE Tool)6, a reticle is automatically carried from a reticle pod to the chuck in the tool. The flatness of the reticle can be measured by an interferometer through a viewport underneath the chamber. We can measure the reticle flatness with 3-nm@rms reproducibility using this setup. We report results of experimental evaluation about the relationship between the reticle OPD, the size of particle and the chucking force of ESC.", "In EUV lithography, particle-free handling is one of the critical issues because a pellicle is impractical due to its high absorption. To investigate this subject, we have developed a mask protection engineering tool that allows various types of tests to be carried out during the transfer of a mask or blank in air and in vacuum. We measured the number of particle adders during the transfer of a mask blank in a dual-pod carrier and in an RSP200 carrier. We found that the number of particle adders (>=46 nm PSL) to a mask blank in a dual pod is less than 0.01 over the whole process from taking the blank out of the load port in air to putting it in the electrostatic chuck chamber in vacuum. Through various experiments, the number of particle adders during any process using a dual pod was found to be very few and very stable. In contrast, for a naked mask, many particle adders were found in large variations. Below one particle were added in over 80% of experiments on a dual pod and in about 20% of experiments on a naked mask. Based on the test results, we can conclude that the use of dual pod is an excellent particle-free transfer technique.", "The effort to produce defect-free mask blanks for EUV lithography relies on increasing the detection sensitivity of advanced mask inspection tools, operating at several wavelengths. We describe the unique measurement capabilities of a prototype actinic (EUV wavelength) microscope that is capable of detecting small defects and reflectivity changes that occur on the scale of microns to nanometers. The defects present in EUV masks can appear in many well-known forms: as particles that cause amplitude or phase variations in the reflected field; as surface contamination that reduces reflectivity and contrast; and as damage from inspection and use that reduces the reflectivity of the multilayer coating. This paper presents an overview of several topics where scanning actinic inspection makes a unique contribution to EUVL research. We describe the role of actinic scanning inspection in defect repair studies, observations of laser damage, actinic inspection following scanning electron microscopy, and the detection of both native and programmed defects.", "Reliable and compact extreme ultraviolet (EUV) laboratory sources are strongly required for in-house characterization of optical components and for the precise calibration of EUV diagnostic instruments. The EUV tube, based on the transfer of advanced microfocus x-ray tube technology into the EUV spectral range around 13.5 nm, is an important tool for these applications. Great benefits of this source are a compact and flexible design, debris-free operation, and high temporal and spatial long-term stability. Detailed characteristics of the source performance are reported and different examples for at-wavelength metrology are presented.", "EUV lithography is expected to be inserted for the 32/22 nm nodes with possible extension below. EUV resist availability remains one of the main issues to be resolved. There is an urgent need to provide suitable tools to accelerate resist development and to achieve resolution, LER and sensitivity specifications simultaneously. An interferometer lithography tool offers advantages regarding conventional EUV exposure tool. It allows the evaluation of resists, free from the deficiencies of optics and mask which are limiting the achieved resolution. Traditionally, a dedicated beam line from a synchrotron, with limited access, is used as a light source in EUV interference lithography. This paper identifies the technology locks to develop a stand alone EUV interferometer using a compact EUV source. It will describe the theoretical solutions adopted and especially look at the feasibility according to available technologies. EUV sources available on the market have been evaluated in terms of power level, source size, spatial coherency, dose uniformity, accuracy, stability and reproducibility. According to the EUV source characteristics, several optic designs were studied (simple or double gratings). For each of these solutions, the source and collimation optic specifications have been determined. To reduce the exposure time, a new grating technology will also be presented allowing to significantly increasing the transmission system efficiency. The optical grating designs were studied to allow multi-pitch resolution print on the same exposure without any focus adjustment. Finally micro mechanical system supporting the gratings was studied integrating the issues due to vacuum environment, alignment capability, motion precision, automation and metrology to ensure the needed placement control between gratings and wafer. A similar study was carried out for the collimation-optics mechanical support which depends on the source characteristics.", "Immersion lithography addresses the limits of optical lithography by providing higher NA's (NA > 1), which enable imaging of smaller features and hence it enables production of 45nm logic devices. One of the key challenges of this advanced technology, however, is controlling the defectivity level produced specifically by the Lithography immersion stepper and track systems. To control and monitor the immersion processes in production, consideration has been given to identifying an alternative to the traditional sensitivity approaches, using Darkfield (DF) and Brightfield (BF) wafer inspection methodologies. This unique method should provide for stable, reliable and sensitive inspection results which are capable of supporting a technology node introduction (product ramp) as well as monitoring the base line performance (in other words, capture excursions). The following study was done to explore laser DUV Brightfield inspection, utilizing the Applied Materials UVisionTM, which has the ability to detect defects as small as 20-40nm size. Additionally a joint project between AMD, ASML and AMAT developed an appropriate inspection strategy that combines, lithographic defect printing simulations and sensitive inspection routines to identify defect problems effectively, drive defect reduction efforts and result in stable production monitoring. We investigated the use of traditional Photo Test Monitor (PTM) as a valid technique to monitor the introduction of the immersion lithography at 45nm. In addition, we explored the correlation between these PTM wafers and the actual production wafers for new types of defects. It was found that the amount of small protrusion defects (~20-40nm size) increased on immersion PTM wafers compared to dry processed PTM wafers. Based on process experiments at AMD and immersion defect simulations provided by ASML we were able to isolate immersion specific defect problems from general lithography related defects also seen in Dry lithography. The results show that unique combination of high sensitivity defect inspection methods and simulation efforts can very effectively drive defect reduction efforts and accelerate yield on advanced technology like immersion lithography. Additionally, it is also possible to provide a production monitoring of 45nm immersion processes with such extreme sensitive inspection of PTM wafers of defects down to 20nm.", "The introduction of Immersion lithography, combined with the desire to maximize the number of potential yielding devices per wafer, has brought wafer edge engineering to the forefront for advanced semiconductor manufactures. Bevel cleanliness, the position accuracy of the lithography films, and quality of the EBR cut has become more critical. In this paper, the effectiveness of wafer track based solutions to enable state-of-art bevel schemes is explored. This includes an integrated bevel cleaner and new bevel rinse nozzles. The bevel rinse nozzles are used in the coating process to ensure a precise, clean film edge on or near the bevel. The bevel cleaner is used immediately before the wafer is loaded into the scanner after the coating process. The bevel cleaner shows promise in driving down defectivity levels, specifically printing particles, while not damaging films on the bevel.", "At PTB a new type of DUV scatterometer has been developed. The concept of the system is very variable, so that many different types of measurements like e. g. goniometric scatterometry, ellipsometric scatterometry, polarisation dependent reflectometry and ellipsometry can be performed. The main applications are CD, pitch and edge profile characterisation of nano-structured surfaces mainly, but not only, on photomasks. Different operation wavelength down to 193nm can be used. The system is not only a versatile tool for a variety of different at-wavelength metrology connected with state-of-the-art photolithography. It allows also to adapt and to vary the measurand and measurement geometry to optimise the sensitivity and the unambiguity for the measurement problem. For the evaluation of the measurements the inverse diffraction problem has to be solved. For this purpose we developed a special FEM-based software, which is capable to solve both the direct diffraction problem and the inverse diffraction problem. The latter can be accomplished using different optimisation schemes. Additionally this software allows also to estimate the quality of the measured data and the model based measurement uncertainty. This paper gives an overview about the PTB DUV scatterometer, it's metrological potential and the evaluation methods applied using the software DIPOG2.1.", "Over the last few years, the need for shape metrology for process control has increased. A key component of shape metrology is sidewall angle (SWA). However, few instruments measure SWA directly. The critical dimension atomic force microscope (CD-AFM) is one such instrument. The lateral scanning capability and the shape of the CD-AFM probe enable direct access to the feature sidewall. This produces profile information that could be used as a process monitor. Due to their relative insensitivity to material properties, CD-AFMs have been used as reference measurement systems (RMS) for measurands such as width. We present a technique for calculating the uncertainty of sidewall angle measurements using a CD-AFM. We outline an overall calibration strategy; address the uncertainty sources for such measurements, including instrument-related and parameter extraction; related; and discuss the way the calibration is transferred to workhorse instruments.", "We present a summary of various methods for inverting top and bottom critical dimension (CD) data to extract dose and focus information. We explain analytical, numerical, and library inversion techniques in detail, and explore their relative merits for the purposes of online and offline focus monitoring use models. We also detail the modeling requirements associated with each inversion technique, and -- for cases where the model form is flexible -- present a cross-validation methodology for optimizing the response model to fit experimental data. We present modeling and inversion results from seven exemplary photolithography processes, and study the results from each methodology in detail. While each method has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, we show that the library method represents the optimum choice to satisfy a variety of use models while minimizing cost.", "Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) Model Calibration has required an increasing number of measurements as the critical dimension tolerances have gotten smaller. Measurement of two dimensional features have been increasing at a faster rate than features with one dimensional character as the technologies require better accuracy in the OPC models for line-end pull-back and corner rounding. New techniques are becoming available from metrology tool manufacturers to produce GDSII contours of shapes from wafers and modeling software has been improved to use these contours. The challenges of implementing contour generation from the SEM tools will be discussed including calibration methods, physical dimensions, algorithm derivations, and contour registration, resolution, scan direction, and parameter space coverage.", "Semiconductor manufacturing is always looking for more effective ways to monitor and control the manufacturing process. Helium Ion Microscopy (HIM) presents a new approach to process monitoring which has several potential advantages over the traditional scanning electron microscope (SEM) currently in use in semiconductor research and manufacturing facilities across the world. Due to the very high source brightness, and the shorter wavelength of the helium ions, it is theoretically possible to focus the ion beam into a smaller probe size relative to that of an electron beam of an SEM. Hence, resolution 2 to 4 times that of comparable SEMs is theoretically possible. In an SEM, an electron beam interacts with the sample and an array of signals are generated, collected and imaged. This interaction zone may be quite large depending upon the accelerating voltage and materials involved. Conversely, the helium ion beam interacts with the sample, but it does not have as large an excitation volume and thus, the image collected is more surface sensitive and can potentially provide sharp images on a wide range of materials. Compared to an SEM, the secondary electron yield is quite high - allowing for imaging at extremely low beam currents and the relatively low mass of the helium ion, in contrast to other ion sources such as gallium potentially results in minimal damage to the sample. This presentation will report on some of the preliminary work being done on the HIM as a research and measurement tool for semiconductor process metrology being done at NIST.", "Demanding sub-45 nm node lithographic methodologies such as double patterning (DPT) pose significant challenges for overlay metrology. In this paper, we investigate scatterometry methods as an alternative approach to meet these stringent new metrology requirements. We used a spectroscopic diffraction-based overlay (DBO) measurement technique in which registration errors are extracted from specially designed diffraction targets for double patterning. The results of overlay measurements are compared to traditional bar-in-bar targets. A comparison between DBO measurements and CD-SEM measurements is done to show the correlation between the two approaches. We discuss the total measurement uncertainty (TMU) requirements for sub-45 nm nodes and compare TMU from the different overlay approaches.", "Particle contamination on surfaces used in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask blank deposition, mask fabrication, and patterned mask handling must be avoided since the contamination can create significant distortions and loss of reflectivity. Particles on the order of 10nm are problematic during MLM mirror fabrication, since the introduced defects disrupt the local Bragg planes. The most serious problem is the accumulation of particles on surfaces of patterned blanks during EUV light exposure, since > 25nm particles will be printed without an out-of-focus pellicle. Particle contaminants are also a problem with direct imprint processes since defects are printed every time. Plasma Assisted Cleaning by Electrostatics (PACE) works by utilizing a helicon plasma as well as a pulsed DC substrate bias to charge particle and repel them electrostatically from the surface. Removal of this nature is a dry cleaning method and removes contamination perpendicular from the surface instead of rolling or sweeping the particles off the surface, a benefit when cleaning patterned surfaces where contamination can be rolled or trapped between features. Also, an entire mask can be cleaned at once since the plasma can cover the entire surface, thus there is no need to focus in on an area to clean. Sophisticated particle contamination detection system utilizing high power laser called DEFCON is developed to analyze the particle removal after PACE cleaning process. PACE has shown greater than 90 % particle removal efficiencies for 30 to 220 nm PSL particles on ruthenium capped quartz. Removal results for silicon surfaces and quartz surfaces show similar removal efficiencies. Results of cleaning 80 nm PSL spheres from silicon substrates will be shown.", "We present a new optical technique for dimensional analysis of sub 100 nm sized targets by analyzing through-focus images obtained using a conventional bright-field optical microscope. We present a method to create through-focus image maps (TFIM) using optical images, which we believe unique for a given target. Based on this we present a library matching method that enables us to determine all the dimensions of an unknown target. Differential TFIMs of two targets are distinctive for different dimensional differences and enable us to uniquely identify the dimension that is different between them. We present several supporting examples using optical simulations and experimental results. This method is expected to be applicable to a wide variety of targets and geometries.", "The 3D-AFM technique is a very well known technique as a non destructive reference to calibrate CD-SEM and Scatterometry metrology. However, recent hardware, tip design and tip treatment improvements have offered to the technique new capabilities that pave the way for multiple applications in the semiconductor industry. The 3D-AFM technique is today not only a calibrating technique but also a process control technique that can be use either at the R&D level or in fab environment. In this paper, we will address the limits of the 3D-AFM technique for the semiconductor industry depending on the applications by focusing our study on tip to sample interactions. We will identify, test and validate potential industrial solutions that could extend the 3D-AFM potentialities. Subsequently, we will show some interesting applications of the technique related to LER/LWR transfer during silicon gate patterning and related to advance multiwires devices fabrication.", "Particle standard is important and widely used for calibration of inspection tools and process characterization and benchmarking. We have developed a method for generating and classifying monodisperse particles of different materials with a high degree of control. The airborne particles are first generated by an electrospray. Then a tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (TDMA) system is used to obtain monodisperse particles with NIST-traceable sizes. We have also developed a clean and well-controlled method to deposit airborne particles on mask blanks or wafers. This method utilizes electrostatic approach to deposit particles evenly in a desired spot. Both the number of particles and the spot size are well controlled. We have used our system to deposit PSL, silica and gold particles ranging from 30 nm to 125 nm on 193nm and EUV mask blanks. We report the experimental results of using these particles as calibration standards and discuss the dependency of sensitivity on the types of particles and substrate surfaces.", "NIST is currently developing two Reference scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), which are based on FEI Nova 600* variable vacuum, and on FEI Helios* dual-beam instruments. These were installed in the new Advanced Metrology Laboratory at NIST where the temperature variation is under 0.1 C\u00b0 and the humidity variation is under 1%. Both SEMs are equipped with field emission electron guns and are capable of better than 1 nm spatial resolution. The ESEM has large sample capability, allowing for measurements on 200 mm wafers, 300 mm wafers and 150 mm photolithography masks, with a 100 mm by 100 mm measurement area in the center. The dual-beam instrument's laser stage will work on smaller samples and has a 50 mm by 50 mm measurement area. The variable vacuum instrument is especially suitable for measurements on a large and diverse set of samples without the use of conductive coating. These will be among the most scrutinized of SEMs. A detailed, thorough work of combined measurements and optimization of the SEMs themselves is underway, which includes the assessment of resolution, signal transfer characteristics, distortion and noise characteristics in various working modes. Accurate three-dimensional modeling, including all aspects of beam formation, signal generation, detection and processing is under development. Establishment of modeling and measurement methods to ascertain the threedimensional shape and size of the electron beam is also underway. All these are needed to properly interpret the obtained data in accurate, physics-based measurements and will permit three-dimensional size and shape determination on a scale ranging from a few nanometers up to a few centimeters. Accuracy and traceability will be ensured through calibrated laser interferometry.", "Average CD of CD SEM and scatterometry CD (OCD) have been adopted for advanced CD control. The advantages and disadvantages of these two CD metrologies have been well discussed. The target of CD uniformity (CDU) for advanced technology has been driven to 1 nm, i.e. about three and half the size of a silicon atom, which is 0.29 nm. In the real production environment, engineers need to face sub-nanometer (< 1 nm) CD variations and do the necessary process corrections to meet the 1-nm CDU requirement. In other words, advanced CD process control has already been in the world of atomic scale. It turns out that methodology to ensure the accuracy of sub-nanometer CD has become essential for advanced CD control. In this paper, we introduced a methodology to produce 0.25, 0.5, and 1 nm programmed pitch offsets through mask design. These offsets are attainable with current process capability. Pitch offsets instead of line/space width offsets were used because the pitch is relatively process insensitive. The pitch has already been widely used as a CD SEM magnification calibration standard, e.g. Hitachi m-scale 240-nm pitch and VLSI 100-nm pitch standards. We produced large and small pitch splits to meet different magnification linearity requirements. We also used optical CD to verify the programmed pitch offset. Using the raw spectrum of OCD, systematic pitch signal changes in 0.25-nm steps can be detected, ensuring that 0.25-nm pitch offset standards are meaningful. Interestingly, 0.25 nm is smaller than the 0.29-nm Si atom. We also used this standard wafer to do the sampling size or data quality evaluation for different CD SEM measurement methodologies, e.g. 150K by 150K or 80K by 35K magnifications that in turn dictates the sample size. Pitch sensitivity is strongly related to the sampling size and line-edge roughness (LER). For example, 0.25-nm pitch sensitivity needs a larger sampling size than those of 0.5-nm and 1- nm pitch sensitivities. By means of this standard wafer, we can easily quantify metrology quality as well as choose the right metrology and sampling size for advanced process control.", "To use atomic force microscope (AFM) to measure dense patterns of 32-nm node structures, there is a difficulty in providing flared probes that go into narrow vertical features. Using carbon nanotube (CNT) probes is a possible alternative. However, even with its extremely high stiffness, van der Waals attractive force from steep sidewalls bends CNT probes. This probe deflection effect causes deformation (or \"swelling\") of the measured profile. When measuring 100-nm-high vertical sidewalls with a 24-nm-diameter and 220-nm-long CNT probe, the probe deflection can cause a bottom CD bias of 13.5 nm. This phenomenon is inevitable when using long, thin probes whichever scanning method is used. We have developed a method of deconvolving this probe deflection effect that is well suited to our AFM scanning mode, Advanced Step-inTM mode. In this scanning mode, the probe is not dragged on the sample surface but approaches the sample surface vertically at each measurement point. The CNT probe deformation is stable because we do not use cantilever oscillation that can cause instability, but we detect static flexure of the cantilever. Consequently, it is possible to estimate the amount of CNT probe deflection by detecting the degree of cantilever torsion. Using this information, we have developed a technique for deconvolving the probe deformation effect from measured profiles. This technique in combination with deconvolution of the probe shape effect makes vertical sidewall profile measurement possible.", "The present paper is a continuation of an investigation to validate CD AFM image reconstruction using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) as the Reference Metrology System (RMS). In the present work, the validation of CD AFM with TEM is extended to include a 26 nm diameter carbon nanotube (CNT) tip for non-reentrant feature scans. The use of DT (deep trench) mode and a CNT tip provides detailed bottom feature resolution and close mid-CD agreement with both TEM and prior CD mode AFM scans (using a high resolution Trident tip). Averaging AFM scan lines within the ~80 nm thickness region of the TEM sample is found to reduce systematic error with the RMS. Similarly, errors in alignment between AFM scan lines and TEM sample are corrected by a moving average method. Next, the NanoCD standard is used for complete 2D tip shape reconstruction (non-reentrant) utilizing its traceable feature width and well-defined upper-corner radius. The shape of the NanoCD is morphologically removed from the tip/standard image, thus providing the tip's shape with bounded dimensional uncertainty. Finally, an update of the measurement uncertainty budget for the current generation CD AFM is also presented, thus extending the prior work by NIST.", "Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is a powerful metrology tool for process monitoring of semiconductor manufacturing because of its non-destructive, high resolution, three-dimensional measurement ability. In order to utilize AFM for process monitoring, long-term measurement accuracy and repeatability are required even under the condition that probe is replaced. For the measurement of the semiconductor's minute structure at the 45-nm node and beyond, AFM must be equipped with a special probe tip with smaller diameter, higher aspect ratio, sufficient stiffness and durability. Carbon nanotube (CNT) has come to be used as AFM probe tip because of its cylindrical shape with small diameter, extremely high stiffness and flexibility. It is said that measured profiles by an AFM is the convolutions of sample geometry and probe tip dimension. However, in the measurement of fine high-aspect-ratio LSI samples using CNT probe tip, horizontal measurement error caused by attractive force from the steep sidewall is quite serious. Fine and long CNT tip can be easily bent by these forces even with its high stiffness. The horizontal measurement error is caused by observable cantilever torsion and unobservable tip bending. It is extremely difficult to estimate the error caused by tip bending because the stiffness of CNT tips greatly varies only by the difference of a few nanometers in diameter. Consequently, in order to obtain actual sample geometry by deconvolution, it is essential to control the dimension of CNT tips. Tip-end shape also has to be controlled for precise profile measurement. We examined the method for the measurement of CNT probe tip-diameter with high accuracy and developed the screening technique to obtain probes with symmetric tip-ends. By using well-controlled CNT probe and our original AFM scanning method called as Advanced StepInTM mode, reproducible AFM profiles and deconvolution results were obtained. Advanced StepInTM mode with the dimension- and shape-controlled CNT probe can be the solution for process monitoring of semiconductor manufacturing at the 45-nm node and beyond.", "As overlay budgets continue to shrink, there is an increasing need to more fully characterize the tools used to measure overlay. In a previous paper, it was shown how a single-layer Blossom overlay target could be utilized to measure aberrations across the field of view of an overlay tool in an efficient and low-cost manner. In this paper, we build upon this method, and discuss the results obtained, and experiences gained in applying this method to a fleet of currently operational overlay tools. In particular, the post-processing of the raw calibration data is discussed in detail, and a number of different approaches are considered. The quadrant-based and full-field based methods described previously are compared, along with a half-field method. In each case we examine a number of features, including the trade off between ease of use (including the total number of measurements required) versus sensitivity / potential signal to noise ratio. We also examine how some techniques are desensitized to specific types of tool or mark aberration, and suggest how to combine these with non-desensitized methods to quickly identify these anomalies. There are two distinct applications of these tool calibration methods. Firstly, they can be used as part of the tool build and qualification process, to provide absolute metrics of imaging quality. Secondly, they can be of significant assistance in diagnosing tool or metrology issues or providing preventative maintenance diagnostics, as (as shown previously) under normal operation the results show very high consistency, even compared to aggressive overlay requirements. Previous work assumed that the errors in calibration, from reticle creation through to the metrology itself, would be Gaussian in nature; in this paper we challenge that assumption, and examine a specific scenario that would lead to very non-Gaussian behavior. In the tool build / qualification application, most scenarios lead to a systematic trend being superimposed over Gaussian-distributed measurements; these cases are relatively simple to treat. However, in the tool diagnosis application, typical behavior will be very non- Gaussian in nature, for example individual outlier measurements, or exhibiting bimodal or other probability distributions. In such cases, we examine the effect that this has on the analysis, and show that such anomalous behaviors can occur \"under the radar\" of analyses that assume Gaussian behavior. Perhaps more interestingly, the detection / identification of non-Gaussian behavior (as opposed to the parameters of a best fit Gaussian probability density function) can be a useful tool in quickly isolating specific metrology problems. We also show that deviation of a single tool, relative to the tool fleet, is a more sensitive indicator of potential issues.", "Overlay process control up to and including the 45nm node has been implemented using a small number of large measurement targets placed in the scribe lines surrounding each field. There is increasing concern that this scheme does not provide sufficiently accurate information about the variation of overlay within the product area of the device. These concerns have led to the development of new, smaller targets designed for inclusion within the device area of real products [1,2]. The targets can be as small as 1-3\u03bcm on a side, which is small enough to permit their inclusion inside the device pattern of many products. They are measured using a standard optical overlay tool, and then calibrated. However, there is a tradeoff between total measurement uncertainty (TMU) and target size reduction [1]. Also the calibration scheme applied impacts TMU. We report results from measurements of 3\u03bcm targets on 45nm production wafers at both develop and etch stages. An advantage of these small targets is that at the etch stage they can readily be measured using a SEM, which provides a method for verifying the accuracy of the measurements. We show how the 3\u03bcm in-chip targets can be used to obtain detailed information for in-device overlay variability and to maintain overlay control in successive process generations.", "The overlay metrology budget is typically 1/10 of the overlay control budget resulting in overlay metrology total measurement uncertainty requirements of 0.57 nm for the most challenging use cases of the 32nm technology generation. Theoretical considerations show that overlay technology based on differential signal scatterometry (SCOLTM) has inherent advantages, which will allow it to achieve the 32nm technology generation requirements and go beyond it. In this work we present results of an experimental and theoretical study of SCOL. We present experimental results, comparing this technology with the standard imaging overlay metrology. In particular, we present performance results, such as precision and tool induced shift, for different target designs. The response to a large range of induced misalignment is also shown. SCOL performance on these targets for a real stack is reported. We also show results of simulations of the expected accuracy and performance associated with a variety of scatterometry overlay target designs. The simulations were carried out on several stacks including FEOL and BEOL materials. The inherent limitations and possible improvements of the SCOL technology are discussed. We show that with the appropriate target design and algorithms, scatterometry overlay achieves the accuracy required for future technology generations.", "Overlay requirements for semiconductor devices are increasing faster than anticipated. Overlay becomes much harder to control with current methods and therefore novel techniques are needed. In this paper, we present our investigation methods for High Order Control, and the candidates for improvement. This paper will present the study for each components of high order control. High order correction is one component for high order control and several correction methods were compared for this study. High order alignment is another important component for higher order control instead of using conventional linear model for the alignment. Alignment and overlay measurement sampling decision becomes a more critical issue for sampling efficiency and accuracy. Optimal sampling for high order was studied for high order control. Using all these studies, various applications for optimal high order control have also been studied. This study will show the general approach for high order control with theory and actual experimental data.", "We develop a novel target, dual-overlay grating, used in the overlay measurement with an optical bright-field imaging tool. The dual-overlay grating is the combination of two overlay gratings with different pitch. The two overlay grating are approached each other and the separation gap between them is sub-micrometer. The image in the proximity of the boundary of two overlay gratings is measured at in-focus position, and a method is built to analyze the image. The gradient value of image and a merit value are calculated. A series of dual-overlay grating is measured and analyzed with different overlay offset. We found the relation between the merit value and overlay offset is linear in certain region, and the dual-overlay grating has the nano-scale resolution to the overlay offset. Thus, the dual-overlay grating has potential application in overlay metrology for the process control in the future semi-conductor manufacturing.", "This paper discusses the scatterometry-based measurement of a complex thin-spacer PFET structure containing an embedded SiGe (eSiGe) trench. The thickness of the spacer and the overfill of the eSiGe trench are critical measurement parameters for such a structure. Although the corresponding NFET structure does not contain the eSiGe-filled trench, it is also found to be a good barometer of thin-spacer measurement capability and so is also used in the study. First, the paper discusses the dispersion analysis challenges and approaches for these 45 nm node structures. Next, two sets of scatterometry hardware, one in production and one under development, are used to measure the critical parameters in order to understand the differences in measurement performance between the systems. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis is used as a reference metrology to assess the accuracy performance of the hardware. Results show that the advanced optics of the newer system significantly improves the dynamic repeatability of the parameters compared to the older system, while the newer system's extended wavelength range down into the deep UV (DUV) can provide a noticeable improvement in measurement accuracy due to the significantly greater parameter sensitivity in this wavelength range.", "Implementations of scatterometry in the back end of the line (BEOL) of the devices requires design of advanced measurement targets with attention to CMP ground rule constraints as well as model simplicity details. In this paper we outline basic design rules for scatterometry back end targets by stacking and staggering measurement pads to reduce metal pattern density in the horizontal plane of the device and to avoid progressive dishing problems along the vertical direction. Furthermore, important characteristics of the copper shapes in terms of their opaqueness and uniformity are discussed. It is shown that the M1 copper thicknesses larger than 100 nm are more than sufficient for accurate back end scatterometry implementations eliminating the need for modeling of contributions from the buried layers. AFM and ellipsometry line scans also show that the copper pads are sufficiently uniform with a sweet spot area of around 20 \u03bcm. Hence, accurate scatterometry can be done with negligible edge and/or dishing contributions if the measurement spot is placed any where within the sweet spot area. Reference metrology utilizing CD-SEM and CD-AFM techniques prove accuracy of the optical solutions for the develop inspect and final inspect grating structures. The total measurement uncertainty (TMU) values for the process of record line width are of the order of 0.77 nm and 0.35 nm at the develop inspect and final inspect levels, respectively.", "Gate patterning is critical to the final yield and performance of logic devices. Because of this, gate linewidth control is viewed by many as the most critical application for integrated metrology on etch systems. For several years, integrated metrology and wafer-level process control have been used in high volume manufacturing of 90 and 65nm polysilicon gate etch [1], [3], [17], [22]. These wafer-level CD control systems have shown the ability to significantly reduce CD variation. With gate linewidth under control (< 2nm 3\u03c3 wafer-to-wafer), the next parameter to impact gate electrical performance is side wall angle (SWA). SWA had not been considered a critical control parameter due to the difficulty of measurement with conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM). With scatterometry, SWA measurement of litho and etch profiles are included with the critical dimension (CD) measurements. Recently, it has become visible that the polysilicon SWA correlates to electrical device parameters, and is thus, an important parameter to control. This paper will examine the current relationship between litho and etch profile control, determine potential limitations for future technology nodes, and introduce novel etch process control techniques based on multiple input multiple output (MIMO) modeling.", "New material innovations such as Embedded Silicon Germanium (eSiGe) provide a substantial metrology challenge for the 45 nm node technology and beyond. We discuss the details of how scatterometry provides in-line metrology solution to measure key features of the eSiGe structure. Critical features to measure are eSiGe to gate proximity and the un-etched silicon on insulator (SOI) thickness. The proximity measurement is particularly vital because it has a major influence on device performance, yet there was no high throughput in-line metrology solution until scatterometry. Results from multiple scatterometry platforms (three) are presented along with a summary of various metrology performance metrics like precision and accuracy. We also show how scatterometry measurements have been instrumental in supporting process development efforts. The comparison of scatterometry measurements to reference data from multiple metrology techniques is presented in order to evaluate the accuracy performance of various supplier platforms. Reference metrology techniques used are thin-film measurements from un-patterned targets, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cross-section scanning electron microscopy (XSEM). Tool matching uncertainty (TMU) analysis and weighted reference measurement system (wRMS) technique have been utilized to assist in the interpretation of correlation data. Scatterometry results from various wafers that were generated to modulate spacer width and etch cavity are also presented. The results demonstrate good sensitivity for key measurement features, especially eSiGe proximity and un-etched SOI thickness, which have very tight process control requirements.", "Aggressive CMOS transistor scaling requirements have motivated the IC industry to look beyond simply reducing the film thickness or implementing different gate stack materials towards fundamentally redesigning the transistor architecture by forcing the silicon channel to protrude upwards from the planar (2D) substrate. These 3D transistors, namely FinFETs, ideally offer at least a 2X improvement in the drive current since more than one surface is available, for which the minority carrier population can be adjusted by an applied voltage. However, the ability to modulate this voltage is known to suffer due to the non-uniform film deposition on the three sides of the Si Fin. This concern is of immediate interest because it impedes device performance and future integration since subtle differences among the thicknesses on each side of the Fin will negatively impact threshold voltage and the capability to tune the effective work function. It is therefore necessary to have an in-line metrology capability that can properly characterize and understand the deposition of both the high-k and metal gate film on the sidewalls of the Fin in order for FinFETs to ultimately replace planar CMOS devices. We will report on the ability of scatterometry to accurately measure the high-k and metal film thickness on the sidewall of the FinFET. The results will be discussed in detail with emphasis on sensitivity towards fin critical dimension (CD) and sidewall thickness, and comparison of the conclusions reached from the analysis with cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data.", "CMOS 65nm technology node requires the introduction of advanced materials for critical patterning operations. The study is focused on the multilayer Anti Reflective Coating (ARC) stack, used in photolithography, for the gate patterning such as Advanced Patterning Film (APF). The interest on this new and complex ARC stack lies in the benefit to guarantee low CD dispersion thanks to a better reflectivity control and resist budget which leads to a larger lithographic process window. However, it implies numerous metrology challenges. The paper deals with the challenges of monitoring the gate Critical Dimension (CD) on this stack. The validation of the scatterometry model versus stack thicknesses and indexes variations, through experiments, is also described. The final result is the complete characterization of the materials for thickness and scatterometry CD control, for photo feedback and for etch feed-forward deployment in an industrial mode. The analysis shows that scatterometry measurements on a standard 65 nm gate process ensure a better effectiveness than the CD Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) ones when injected in the Advanced Process Control (APC) system from photo to etch.", "The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) provides a set of Metrology specifications as targets for each technology node. In the current edition (2007) of the ITRS the conventional precision (reproducibility) is replaced with a new metric - measurement uncertainty for dimensional metrology. This measurement uncertainty contains single tool precision, tool-to-tool matching, sampling uncertainty, and inaccuracy (sample-to-sample bias variation and other effects). Clearly, sampling uncertainty is a major component of measurement uncertainty. This paper elaborates on sampling uncertainty and provides statistical estimates for sampling uncertainty. The authors in this paper address the importance and the methods of proper sampling. The correct sampling captures and allows for the expression of the information needed for adequate patterning process control. Along with typical manufacturing process control cases (excursion control, advanced and statistical process control), several other applications are explored such as optical and electron beam line width measurement calibration, measurement tool evaluations, lithographic scanner assessment and optical proximity correction implementation. The authors show how appropriate choices among measurement techniques, sampling methods, and interpretation of measurement results give meaningful information for process control and demonstrate how an incorrect choice can lead to wrong conclusions.", "Critical dimension (CD) or linewidth is one the most critical variable in the lithography process with the most direct impact on the device speed and performance of integrated circuits. Photoresist thickness is one of the photoresist properties that can have an impact on the CD uniformity. Due to thin film interference, CD varies with photoresist thickness. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to control photoresist thickness in real-time during thermal processing steps in the lithography sequence to control CD. As opposed to run-to-run control where information from the previous wafer or batch is used for control of the current wafer or batch, the approach here is real-time and make use of the current wafer information for control of the current wafer CD. The experiments demonstrated that such an approach can reduce CD non-uniformity from wafer-to-wafer and within-wafer.", "This paper present an evaluation of our CMOS 45nm gate patterning process performance based on immersion lithography in a production environment. A CD budget breakdown is shown detailing lot to lot, wafer to wafer, intrawafer, intrafield and proximity CD uniformity characterization. Emphasis is given on scatterometry library development and deployment. We also look more into detail to focus effect on CD control. Finally status of overlay performance with immersion lithography is also presented.", "This paper examines improvement in post-etching gate critical dimension (CD) uniformity by post exposure bake (PEB) temperature control. Although intra-wafer and inter-wafer resist CD uniformity is improved by PEB temperature optimization, intra-wafer gate CD uniformity after etching could not be improved due to etcher-attributed factors. To improve these factors, we carried out two-step optimization that combines lithography CD optimization with etching CD optimization. By using this method, the optimization strategy can clarify the targets of optimization in each step. PEB temperature optimization was performed by two step optimization in which etcher-attributed CD variations were canceled out, leading to 66% improvement of gate etching CD uniformity successfully. Without any changes in modification parameter, this PEB temperature optimization proved to be applicable to several reticle patterns with different pattern density. Moreover, this optimization method proved the applicability to the gate process for a 55nm node logic device for the duration of five months without modification. The result proved its long-term stability and practicality.", "Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) scheme is considered as one of the most promising lithographic techniques to meet the challenges for aggressive flash 32 nm semiconductor technology node and beyond. Monitoring the SADP stages implies the necessity to use metrology methods that meet advanced technology nodes requirements. One important growing metrology factor is the Line Edge Roughness (LER). This factor is most relevant due to the unique processing of the outer vs. inner edges in the SADP process. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the right metrics to tightly monitor SADP process, including the roughness behavior of the features on SADP layers, and seek correspondence of LER characteristics between SADP sequential process stages. Additional element of this study will be to examine the performance of CD-SEM roughness analysis on small features, with the usage of improved LER measurement method that takes into account the contribution of SEM imaging noise to the obtained LER values.", "We have proposed a new inspection method of in-line focus and dose controls for semiconductor volume production. We referred to this method as the focus and dose line navigator (FDLN). Using FDLN, the deviations from the optimum focus and exposure dose can be obtained by measuring the topography of the resist pattern on a process wafer that was made under a single-exposure condition. Generally speaking, FDLN belongs to the technology of solving the inverse problem as scatterometry. The FDLN sequence involves following the two steps. Step 1:creating a focus exposure matrix (FEM) using a test wafer for building the model as supervised data. The model means the relational equation between the multi measurement results of resist patterns ( e.g. Critical dimension (CD), height, sidewall angle) and FEM's exposure conditions. Step 2: measuring the resist patterns on a production wafers and feeding the measurement data into the library to extrapolate focus and dose. In this time, we have evaluated the estimated accuracy of Focus and dose for actual process wafer using the advanced CD-SEM and we also have developed new algorithm for considering against thermal dose error.", "Increasing inspection sensitivity may be necessary for capturing the smaller defects of interest (DOI) dictated by reduced minimum design features. Unfortunately, higher inspection sensitivity can result in a greater percentage of non-DOI or nuisance defect types during inline monitoring in a mass production environment. Due to the time and effort required, review sampling is usually limited to 50 to 100 defects per wafer. Determining how to select and identify critical defect types under very low sampling rate conditions, so that more yield-relevant defect Paretos can be created after SEM review, has become very important. By associating GDS clip (design layout) information with every defect, and including defect attributes such as size and brightness, a new methodology called Defect Criticality Index (DCI) has demonstrated improved DOI sampling rates.", "The optimizing of sampling plans for process control and lot acceptance inspections is emerging as an important subject concerning the recent lithography process. With proper acceptance variables, one can reduce sample size using inspection by variables rather than inspection by attributes. The inspection by variables is cost-effective and desirable. However, it is difficult to apply to a non-normal population. Many cases exist where CD distribution cannot be regarded as normal. If one applies the acceptance sampling inspection with conventional acceptance variables@in those cases, the inspections become tighter or are reduced, which is contrary to expectations. The problem of non-normality, which is an essential property of CD distributions, should be treated extensively. We found that the above problem can be overcome by modifying the conventional acceptance variables through the inclusion of the 3rd moment. As a result, 50% reduction of sample size can be realized by introducing the lot acceptance sampling with new variables.", "The optical defect identification on wafer still remains a useful tool, even if the structure sizes have the order of magnitude of the used wavelengths of the light and far beyond it. Structures are not resolved in this way, but one receives a contrast in the microscopic image of a defect with a certain illumination configuration. We show simulations of such images at structures relevant for practice and present methods to accelerate the computations. These accelerations can cause a loss of accuracy, but they can give hints to useful illumination configurations.", "In this paper, we propose a novel defect inspection method by considering the advantage that the same pattern is repeatedly transferred onto a large number of areas in resist pattern fabrication. This approach consists of following two steps. The first step is to obtain a high-resolution pattern image from multiple low-resolution images of the same pattern on an observed noisy SEM image using a reconstruction-based super-resolution technique where the B-spline interpolation is utilized. It can reconstruct a high-resolution image from the low resolution and noisy images with a high degree of accuracy. The next step is to inspect defects by comparing the high-resolution pattern image with lowresolution images to be verified. We applied our method to model and SEM images to show its validity.", "Electron beam-induced contamination is one of the most bothersome problems encountered in the use of the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Even in \"clean-vacuum\" instruments it is possible that the image gradually darkens because a polymerized hydrocarbon layer with low secondary electron yield is deposited. This contamination layer can get so thick that it noticeably changes the size and shape of the small structures of current and future state-of-the art integrated circuits (ICs). Contamination greatly disturbs or hinders the measurement process and the erroneous results can lead to wrong process control decisions. NIST has developed cleaning procedures and a contamination specification that offer an effective and viable solution for this problem. By the acceptance, implementation and regular use of these methods it is possible to get rid of electron beam induced contamination.", "We developed an in-line inspection method for partial-electrical measurement of contact resistance, which is quantitatively estimated from the voltage contrast formed in an SEM image of an incomplete-contact defect. At first, standard calibration wafers were manufactured for the voltage-contrast calibration. The contact resistance of systematically formed defects was varied from 108 to 1017 ohms. We quantitatively analyzed the grayscale of these defect images captured by a review SEM. Then, the relationship between the grayscales of the defect images captured from these standard calibration wafers and the contact resistances of the defects was studied. We obtained a uniform, stable grayscale of the SEM images of each standard calibration wafer. As a result, calibration curves for estimating the contact resistance of the incomplete-contact defect were obtained at a probe current condition of 80 pA and charging voltages of 1 and 2 V. The estimated contact resistance under these inspection conditions was between 1010 and 1016 ohms. Using this in-line inspection method, we demonstrated wafer mapping of contact resistances calibrated from grayscales of defect patterns. We could not determine whether contact resistances on a wafer widely varied unless we used this method.", "In semiconductor manufacturing, control of hotspots by optical proximity correction (OPC) requires accurate measurements of shapes and sizes of fabricated features. These measurements are carried out using CD-SEM. In order to measure 2D shapes, edges of features should be clearly defined in all directions. Positions of edges are often unclear because of charging. Depending on the SEM setup and the pattern under measurement, the effect of charging varies. The influence of measurement conditions can be simulated and optimized. A Monte Carlo electron-beam simulation tool was developed, which takes into account electron scattering and charging. CD-SEM imaging of SiO2 lines on Si were studied. In experiment, an effect of contrast tone reversal was found, when beam voltage was varied. The same effect was also found in simulations, where contrast reversal was similar to the experimental results. The time dependence of contrast variation was also studied. A good agreement between simulation and measurement was found. The simulation software proved reliable in predicting SEM images, which makes it an important tool to optimize settings of electron-beam tools. Based on such simulations, optimum conditions of SEM setup can be found.", "For many years, lithographic resolution has been the main obstacle for keeping the pace of transistor densification to meet Moore's Law. For the 45 nm node and beyond, new lithography techniques are being considered, including immersion ArF lithography (iArF) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. As in the past, these techniques will use new types of photoresists with the capability to print 45 nm node (and beyond) feature widths and pitches. In a previous paper (\"SEM Metrology for Advanced Lithographies,\" Proc SPIE, v6518, 65182B, 2007), we compared the effects of several types of resists, ranging from deep ultraviolet (DUV) (248 nm) through ArF (193 nm) and iArF to extreme UV (EUV, 13.5 nm). iArF resists were examined, and the results from the available resist sample showed a tendency to shrink in the same manner as the ArF resist but at a lower magnitude. This paper focuses on variations of iArF resists (different chemical formulations and different lithographic sensitivities) and examine new developments in iArF resists during the last year. We characterize the resist electron beam induced shrinkage behavior under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and evaluate the shrinkage magnitude on mature resists as well as R&D resists. We conclude with findings on the readiness of SEM metrology for these challenges.", "In this research, we improved litho process monitor performance with CD-SEM for hyper-NA lithography. First, by comparing litho and etch process windows, it was confirmed that litho process monitor performance is insufficient just by CD measurement because of litho-etch CD bias variation. Then we investigated the impact of the changing resist profile on litho-etch CD bias variation by cross-sectional observation. As a result, it was determined that resist loss and footing variation cause litho-etch CD bias variation. Then, we proposed a measurement method to detect the resist loss variation from top-down SEM image. Proposed resist loss measurement method had good linearity to detect resist loss variation. At the end, threshold of resist loss index for litho process monitor was determined as to detect litho-etch CD bias variation. Then we confirmed that with the proposed resist loss measurement method, the litho process monitor performance was improved by detection of litho-etch CD bias variation in the same throughput as CD measurement.", "As design rules shrink, there is an increase in the complexity. OPC/RET have been facilitating unprecedented yield at k1 factors, they increase the mask complexity and production cost, and can introduce yield-detracting errors. Currently OPC modeling techniques are based on extensive CD-SEM measurements which are limited to one dimensional structures or specific shape structures e.g. contact holes. As a result the measured information is not representing the whole spatial 2D change in the process. Therefore the most common errors are found in the OPC design itself and in the resulting patterning robustness across the process window. A new methodology for OPC model creation and verification is to extract contours from complex test structures which beside the CD values contain further information about e.g. various proximities. In this work we use 2D contour profiles extracted automatically by the CD-SEM over varying focus and exposure conditions. We will show that the measurement sensitivity and uncertainty of that algorithm through the whole process window fulfills the requirements of the ITRS with respect to CD-SEM metrology tools. This will be done on various test structures normally being used for OPC model generation and OPC stability monitoring. Furthermore a study on systematic influences on the quality of the extracted contours has been started. This study includes the evaluation of various parameters which are considered as possible contributors to the uncertainty of the edge contour extraction. As one of the parameters we identified the pixel size of the SEM images. Furthermore, a new metric for calculating repeatability and reproducibility determination for 2D contour extraction algorithms will be presented. By applying this contour extraction based methodology to different CD-SEM tool generations the influence of SEM beam resolution to the quality of the contours will be evaluated.", "Multi patterning lithography (MPL) breaks the k1=0.25 barrier to become the main candidate for 32nm device fabrication before 2010. When using MPL, overlay (OVL) becomes an essential part of the overall critical dimension (CD) budget and therefore can no longer be treated as a separate process control measure. Furthermore, the CD measured at each of the two consecutive lithography steps must be combined into one single 32nm process control measure and will require further improvements of CD-SEM precision, resolution and accuracy. The metrology challenges involved in measuring double patterning CD and OVL arise from the fact that across chip pitch variations (ACPV) are determined by the two separate lithographic processes [1]. This aspect makes the control of the process significantly more complex and requires careful measurement of the processes, both individually as well as combined. Meeting the ITRS specifications for CD and localized OVL measurements beyond 32nm half pitch is challenging and will require innovative CDSEM algorithmic solutions. This paper is a follow-up from last year's paper that introduced SEM metrology for MPL technology. In this paper, we report on the actual implementation of combined CD and OVL metrology solutions for the latest immersion scanner generation. We will describe the latest OVL measurements performed at ASML and demonstrate the robustness of the novel algorithm for accurate separation and recombination of two individual CD populations related to the consecutive MPL steps.", "With the planned introduction of double patterning techniques, the focus of attention has been on tool overlay performance and whether or not this meets the required overlay for double patterning. However, as we require tighter and tighter overlay performance, the impact of the selected integration strategy plays a key part in determining the achievable overlay performance. Very little attention has been given at this time to the impact of for example deposition steps, oxidation steps, CMP steps and the impact that they have on wafer deformation and therefore degraded overlay performance, which directly reduces the available overlay budget. Also, selecting the optimum alignment strategy to follow, either direct or indirect alignment, plays an important part in achieving optimum overlay performance. In this paper we investigate the process impact of various double patterning integration strategies and attempt to show the importance of selecting the right strategy with respect to achieving a manufacturable double patterning process. Furthermore, we report a methodology to minimize process overlay by modelling the non-linear grids for process induced wafer deformation and demonstrate best achievable overlay by feeding this information back to the relevant process steps.", "Current ITRS projections indicate that overlay metrology measurement uncertainty requirements will be less than 1 nm by the year 2009. The challenge in attaining this level of precision for semiconductor and thin-film head (TFH) applications is complicated by the use of increasingly complex multilayer dielectric stacks in the fabricated devices. This paper details results from a fundamental study designed to quantify and understand the effects of dielectric film optical properties on overlay metrology uncertainty. Overlay precision was measured for a series of advanced imaging metrology (AIM) targets having a region of interest (ROI) ranging from 2.8 - 19.5 \u03bcm and mark pitch ranging from 1.9 - 4.5 \u03bcm. The interlayer dielectric (ILD) film separating the layers of relevance was systematically varied in both thickness (0 - 5 \u03bcm) and refractive index (1.60 - 2.54). A reasonable correlation is observed between the measured precision values and the Rayleigh optical thickness, indicating that the optical clarity of ILD films contributes significantly to the minimum achievable overlay metrology precision.", "It is evident that DRAM ground rule continues to shrink down to 90nm and beyond, overlay performance has become more and more critical and important. Wafer edge shows different behavior from center by processes, e.g. a tremendous misalignment at wafer edge makes yield loss . When a conventional linear model is used for alignment correction, higher uncorrectable overlay residuals mostly happen at wafer edge. Therefore, it's obviously necessary to introduce an innovational alignment correction methdology to reduce unwanted wafer edge effect. In this study, we demonstrate the achievement of moderating poor overlay in wafer edge area by a novel zone-dependent alignment strategy, the so-called \"Zone Alignment (ZA)\". The main difference between the conventional linear model and zone alignment strategy is that the latter compensates an improper averaging effect from first modeling through weighting all surrounding marks with a nonlinear model. In addition, the effects of mark quantity and sampling distribution from \"Zone Alignment\" are also introduced in this paper. The results of this study indicate that ZA can reduce uncorrectable overlay residual and improve wafer-to-wafer variation significantly. Furthermore, obvious yield improvement is verified by ZA strategy. In conclusion, Zone alignment is the noteworthy strategy for overlay improvement. Moreover, suitable alignment map and mark numbers should be taken into consideration carefully when ZA is applied for further technology node.", "Traditionally OPC models are calibrated to match CD measurements from selected test pattern locations. This demand for massive CD data drives advances in metrology. Considerable progress has recently been achieved in complimenting this CD data with SEM contours. Here we propose solutions to some challenges that emerge in calibrating OPC models from the experimental contours. We discuss and state the minimization objective as a measure of the distance between simulation and experimental contours. The main challenge is to correctly process inevitable gaps, discontinuities and roughness of the SEM contours. We discuss standardizing the data interchange formats and procedures between OPC and metrology vendors.", "Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) has become an integral and critical part of process development for advanced technologies with challenging k1 requirements. OPC solutions in turn require stable, predictive models to be built that can project the behavior of all structures. These structures must comprehend all geometries that can occur in the layout in order to define the optimal corrections by feature, and thus enable a manufacturing process with acceptable margin. The model is built upon two main component blocks. First, is knowledge of the process conditions which includes the optical parameters (e.g. illumination source, wavelength, lens characteristics, etc) as well as mask definition, resist parameters and process film stack information. Second, is the empirical critical dimension (CD) data collected using this process on specific test features the results of which are used to fit and validate the model and to project resist contours for all allowable feature layouts. The quality of the model therefore is highly dependent on the integrity of the process data collected for this purpose. Since the test pattern suite generally extends to below the resolution limit that the process can support with adequate latitude, the CD measurements collected can often be quite noisy with marginal signal-to-noise ratios. In order for the model to be reliable and a best representation of the process behavior, it is necessary to scrutinize empirical data to ensure that it is not dominated by measurement noise or flyer/outlier points. The primary approach for generating a clean, smooth and dependable empirical data set should be a replicated measurement sampling that can help to statistically reduce measurement noise by averaging. However, it can often be impractical to collect the amount of data needed to ensure a clean data set by this method. An alternate approach is studied in this paper to further smooth the measured data by means of curve fitting to identify remaining questionable measurement points for engineering scrutiny since they may run the risk of incorrectly skewing the model. In addition to purely statistical data curve fitting, another concept also merits investigation, that of using first principle, simulation-based characteristic coherence curves to fit the measured data.", "The volume of measurements and the complexity of metrology recipes in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing have made the conventional manual process of creating the recipes increasingly problematic. To address these challenges, we implemented a system for automatically creating production metrology recipes. We present results from the use of this system for CD-SEM and overlay tools in a high-volume manufacturing environment and show that, in addition to the benefits of reduced engineering time and improved tool utilization, recipes produced by the automated system are in many respects more robust than the equivalent manually created recipes.", "Sub-resolution assistance feature (SRAF) has become one of popular resolution enhancement technique because it is the most easily applicable technique that can be adopted for sub-65 nm node technology. The SRAF can be realized, for example, by locating lines having width below resolution limit around isolated feature. With the SRAF, intensity profile of the isolated feature will be modified to dense-like one and, as a result, focus response of the isolated feature can be improved up to dense feature level. Previous works on SRAF have focused mainly on the critical dimension (CD) margin window. However, CD margin window is not sufficient to evaluate optimum SRAF configuration because process margin degradation due to irregular pattern profile such as line edge roughness (LER) would become more prominent as technology node goes beyond sub-65nm node. Therefore, appropriate methodology to optimize SRAF configuration both for CD margin window and pattern profile is indispensable for those applications. In this paper, we focus on the impact of SRAF configuration to pattern profile as well as CD margin window. The SRAF configuration was adjusted by varying assistance feature to main feature distance and pitch of the assistance features at mask level. Pattern profile was investigated by measuring LER with varying assistance feature parameters quantitatively. From the results, we prove the impact of SRAF configuration both on pattern profile and CD margin window. We also show that the experimental data can easily be predicted by calibrating aerial image simulation results to measured LER. As a conclusion, we suggest methodology to set up optimum SRAF configuration with regard to both CD margin window and pattern profile.", "A new methodology to predict changes in device performances due to systematic lithography and etch effects is described in this paper. Our methodology consists on Automatic Edge-Contour-Extraction (ECE) on Poly Over Active Layer, taking along the manufacturing variability. In general, the AMAT SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) ECE algorithm is based on CAD (GDS) to SEM pattern recognition, followed by CD based 2D edge extraction. Device modeling (using SPICE simulation) is used, to predict the nominal values as well as the device performances variability of the transistors drive current (Ion) and leakage current (Ioff). We used our method to compare a classical (simple rectangular) transistors and \"U-Shape AA\" transistors, both manufactured using Tower TS013LL (0.13um Low-Leakage) Platform. It was found, as predicted, that U-shape transistors have larger W distribution. However, \"U-shape\" also showed much tighter L distribution and the overall Ion spread is lower comparing to classical transistors. Also, U-Shape transistors found to have lower Lstdev (gate length distribution of each individual transistor). We also used the ECE methodology, to compare transistors of single side dog-bone to double-side dog-bone. Based on our work, we can predict that single-side dog-bone transistors, will have higher and larger Ioff distributions, and the overall Ioff speared along the wafer, will go up to a factor of x2.5.", "There has been a substantial increase in the research and development of optical metrology techniques as applied to linewidth and overlay metrology for semiconductor manufacturing. Much of this activity has been in advancing scatterometry applications for metrology. In recent years we have been developing a related technique known as scatterfield optical microscopy, which combines elements of scatterometry and bright field imaging. In this paper we present the application of this technique to optical system alignment, calibration, and characterization for the purpose of accurate normalization of optical data, which can be compared with optical simulations involving only absolute measurement parameters. We show a series of experimental data from lines prepared using a focus exposure matrix on silicon and make comparisons between the experimental and theoretical results. The data show agreement on the nanometer scale using parametric simulation libraries and no \"tunable\" parameters.", "We review early challenges and opportunities for optical CD metrology (OCD) arising from the potential insertion of double patterning technology (DPT) processes for critical layer semiconductor production. Due to the immaturity of these new processes, simulations are crucial for mapping performance trends and identifying potential metrology gaps. With an analysis methodology similar in spirit to the recent NIST OCD extendability study1, but with aperture and noise models pertinent to current or projected production metrology systems, we use advanced simulation tools to forecast OCD precision performance of key structural parameters (eg., CD, sidewall angle) at litho (ADI) and etch (ACI) steps for a variety of mainstream optical measurement schemes, such as spectroscopic or angle-resolved, to identify strengths and weaknesses of OCD metrology for patterning process control at 32 and 22nm technology nodes. Test case geometries and materials for the simulated periodic metrology targets are derived from published DPT process flows, with ITRS-style scaling rules, as well as rather standard scanner qualification use cases. Consistent with the NIST study, we find encouraging evidence of OCD extendability through 22nm node dense geometries, a surprising and perhaps unexpected result, given the near-absence of published results for the inverse optical scattering problem for periodic structures in the deep sub-wavelength regime.", "A review of selected current and new Maxwell equation solve algorithms used in critical dimension metrology is presented. We show that the standard RCWA can have serious issues under certain conditions, even in some typical scatterometry applications. We present some results showing that some of the newer algorithms we developed can significantly outperform the RCWA. The strengths and weakness of algorithms are illustrated.", "Spectroscopic Mueller polarimetry may provide a useful alternative to standard spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) for the dimensional characterization of periodic structures, as it provides 16 quantities instead of 2 for SE. We present a detailed experimental comparison of the results provided by conventional scatterometry (0.7 - 5 eV) spectral range), Mueller polarimetry in the visible (450 - 825 nm), electron microscopy (top CD-SEM and cross section) and state-of-the-art CDAFM (Veeco X3D). This last instrument was considered as the best reference currently available. The samples were 1D gratings etched in bulk Si, with 150 and 250 nm nominal CDs and several pitches for each CD. SE spectra were taken at zero azimuthal angles (i.e. with the grooves perpendicular to the incidence plane), as it is usually done with standard scatterometers, while Mueller spectra were measured at all azimuths in steps of 5\u00b0, allowing significant consistency tests by comparing the results of the corresponding fits. Both techniques provided CD values in agreement with AFM and CD-SEM data to within 5 nm, comparable to the AFM precision. Grating thickness and sidewall angle (SWA) were best determined by Mueller polarimetry at 90\u00b0 azimuth, while in the usual zero azimuth configuration, SWA was typically underestimated by several degrees.", "CD-SEMs fleet matching is a widely discussed subject and various approaches and procedures to determine it were described in the literature [1,2,4-6]. The different approaches for matching are all based on statistical treatment of CD measurements that are performed on dedicated test structures. The test structures are a limited finite set of features, thus the matching results should be treated as valid only for the specific defined set of test features. The credibility of the matching should be in question for different layers and specifically production layers. Since matching is crucial for reliable process monitoring by a fleet of CD-SEMs, the current matching approaches must be extended so that the matching will be only tool dependent and reproducible on all layers regardless their specific material or topographic characteristics. In our previous work [1] the new approach named \"Physical Matching\" was introduced and a new matching procedure based on the direct estimation of tool physical parameters was described. This approach extends the conventional matching methods to enable significant improvement of the matching between CD-SEM tools in production environment. In this work we present results of applying the physical matching method in FAB environment by using the physical parameters of the brightness and SNR, extend it to noise frequency domain characteristics monitoring, and enhanced collection uniformity. Improving the collection uniformity is also demonstrated and proved to be a significant factor. The advantage of the physical matching with noise spectra analysis approach for a case study is demonstrated. This method will enable detection of specific reasons for mismatching between the tools, based on analysis of specific frequencies that are resulted from known mechanical/electrical noise. The proposed procedure allows tool problems fixing before CD measurements are affected. In order to get a reliable visualization of the difference between two systems, new automatic and manual tool finger print methods were developed. The application of the proposed approach to vendor to vendor matching problem is considered.", "Minute variations in advanced VLSI manufacturing processes are well known to significantly impact device performance and die yield. These variations drive the need for increased measurement sampling with a minimal impact on Fab productivity. Traditional discrete measurements such as CDSEM or OCD, provide, statistical information for process control and monitoring. Typically these measurements require a relatively long time and cover only a fraction of the wafer area. Across array across wafer variation mapping ( AWV) suggests a new approach for high throughput, full wafer process variation monitoring, using a DUV bright-field inspection tool. With this technique we present a full wafer scanning, visualizing the variation trends within a single die and across the wafer. The underlying principle of the AWV inspection method is to measure variations in the reflected light from periodic structures, under optimized illumination and collection conditions. Structural changes in the periodic array induce variations in the reflected light. This information is collected and analyzed in real time. In this paper we present AWV concept, measurements and simulation results. Experiments were performed using a DUV bright-field inspection tool (UVision(TM), Applied Materials) on a memory short loop experiment (SLE), Focus Exposure Matrix (FEM) and normal wafers. AWV and CDSEM results are presented to reflect CD variations within a memory array and across wafers.", "The linewidth measurement capability of the model-based library (MBL) matching technique was evaluated experimentally. This technique estimates the dimensions and shape of a target pattern by comparing a measured SEM image profile to a library of simulated line scans. The simulation model uses a non-linear least squares method to estimate pattern geometry parameters. To examine the application of MBL matching in an advanced lithography process, a focus-exposure matrix wafer was prepared with a leading-edge immersion lithography tool. The evaluation used 36 sites with target structures having various linewidths from 45 to 200 nm. The measurement accuracy was evaluated by using an atomic force microscope (AFM) as a reference measurement system. The results of a first trial indicated that two or more solutions could exist in the parameter space in MBL matching. To solve this problem, we obtained a rough estimation of the scale parameter in SEM imaging, based on experimental results, in order to add a constraint in the matching process. As a result, the sensitivity to sidewall variation in MBL matching was improved, and the measurement bias was reduced from 22.1 to 16 nm. These results indicate the possibility of improving the CD measurement capability by applying this tool parameter appropriately.", "CAD based recipe creation paves the way for complete recipe automation and minimizes the need for human intervention. A high volume production environment presents its own unique challenges for automatic CAD based metrology. In our work we describe the approach of automatic offline CD-SEM recipe creation for production using the Applied Materials OPC Check application. In addition, the study includes a comprehensive analysis of success rates for recipe creation, pattern recognition and measurement. The stability of automatically created recipes was evaluated against process variations for a number of test structures which are typically used for production control. Data was collected for various layers on multiple lots and the performance was compared to that of recipes created directly on the tool. All offline recipes for production were generated waferless from design data with success rates of 100%. They showed pattern recognition success rates and measurement success rates at the same level or better than the rates typically reached by recipes created directly on the tool by an experienced CD-SEM engineer.", "CD-SEM is the metrology tool of choice for patterning process development and production process control. We can make these applications more efficient by extracting more information from each CD-SEM image. This enables direct monitors of key process parameters, such as lithography dose and focus, or predicting the outcome of processing, such as etched dimensions or electrical parameters. Automating CD-SEM recipes at the early stages of process development can accelerate technology characterization, segmentation of variance and process improvements. This leverages the engineering effort, reduces development costs and helps to manage the risks inherent in new technology. Automating CD-SEM for manufacturing enables efficient operations. Novel SEM Alarm Time Indicator (SATI) makes this task manageable. SATI pulls together data mining, trend charting of the key recipe and Operations (OPS) indicators, Pareto of OPS losses and inputs for root cause analysis. This approach proved natural to our FAB personnel. After minimal initial training, we applied new methods in 65nm FLASH manufacture. This resulted in significant lasting improvements of CD-SEM recipe robustness, portability and automation, increased CD-SEM capacity and MT productivity.", "IONiSE is a Monte Carlo simulation which describes the interactions of 5-50 keV energy He+ ions with solids, and predicts the production of ion induced secondary electron (iSE) emission. Its use to determine the most probable implant depth, the maximum ion range, and the effect of straggle are presented. IONiSE has been used to numerically fit literature tabulations of iSE generation from five elements so as to derive excitation energy and mean free path parameters. By employing those parameters in IONiSE the topographic yield variation for iSE as a function of energy and the atomic number of the target has been predicted, and estimates of the individual secondary electron contributions from the incident and backscattered ions have been made. These simulations help to create a foundation for the application and the interpretation of iSE images for metrology.", "A new technology was developed to detect Critical Dimension (CD) variations in a Fourier space. The detection principle is a form birefringence of the wafer. Utilizing this principle, CD and Pattern Edge Roughness (PER) variations are detected as a polarization fluctuation and converted into light intensity. We have achieved high resolution and high sensitivity by combining a form birefringence with a novel optical system. This system detects the light intensity in a Fourier space with a high NA objective, enabling the detection of various lights with different incident angles and polarization states at a time. We have confirmed through simulations that this system has high sensitivity toward CD variations. Furthermore, in partnership with Toshiba Corporation, and through the evaluation of wafers fabricated at Toshiba, we conclude that the light intensity detected by the new system strongly correlates with CD values, and that the new system is capable of detecting CD variations in sufficient sensitivity.", "The damage mechanisms that take place when a reticle is subjected to electrical stress by exposure to an electric field have been investigated by applying voltage directly to the structures in a special test reticle. Surface current was recorded at all levels of stress from 1V to 100V. The current/voltage characteristic was polarity dependent and exhibited increasing non-linearity as the feature spacing was reduced. Atomic Force Microscopy showed that the electrical stress caused EFM (Electric Field induced Migration of chrome), matching the damage seen in reticles stressed through induction by an external electric field. No ESD events were recorded, confirming that EFM is independent of ESD and that it occurs with lower electrical stress. The threshold for EFM was found to be five times lower than the previous estimate, starting at 1V with 1\u00b5m spacing. Damage caused by EFM was shown to be continuous, cumulative and the rate of CD degradation was measured to be from 3 to 6 nm per second.", "Critical dimension small angle X-ray scattering (CD-SAXS) is a measurement platform that is capable of measuring the average cross section and sidewall roughness in patterns ranging from (10 to 500) nm in pitch with sub-nm precision. These capabilities are obtained by measuring and modeling the scattering intensities of a collimated X-ray beam with sub-nanometer wavelength from a periodic pattern, such as those found in optical scatterometry targets. In this work, we evaluated the capability a synchrotron-based CD-SAXS measurements to characterize linewidth roughness (LWR) by measuring periodic line/space patterns fabricated with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography with sub-50 nm linewidths and designed with programmed roughness amplitude and frequency. For these patterns, CD-SAXS can provide high precision data on cross-section dimensions, including sidewall angle, line height, line width, and pitch, as well as the LWR amplitude. We also discuss the status of ongoing efforts to compare quantitatively the CD-SAXS data with topdown critical dimension scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) measurements.", "Fluctuations in the line edge of lithographic features, termed line edge roughness (LER) always exist. At 32 nm line width (and below), LER can be a significant fraction of the feature dimensions. LER can be simply detected by AFM or SEM techniques, however, fast and nondestructive optical techniques should be developed in order to enable effective process control. Optical scatterometry is preferable over other existing measurement techniques, due to the relatively simple implementation in production and lower photoresist damage. In this article we show simulations of LER by 3-dimensional Rigorous Coupled Wave Theory (RCWT) calculations. The prediction of tool capabilities was done using simulations. The outcome of these simulations results where analyzed and used for the basic design of photoresist structures. The conclusions from sensitivity and correlation analysis of the simulation data were verified against measured scatterometry data. Well-defined features with controlled LER, in the range of 2.5 to 15nm, were fabricated by e-beam direct write technique (IMEC, Belgium). The photoresist features we created were a large matrix of different scatterometry targets with varying parameters of CD, Period, LER level, and LER frequency. These features were characterized by electron microscopy and AFM in order to verify the LER values and a NovaScan 3090 system and NovaMARS modeling software were used for the Scatterometry characterization. To achieve better sensitivity to the lower roughness dimensions, we used an option of Effective Medium Approximation (EMA) modeling for spectra analysis. Based on this reference data and the scatterometry measurements we have developed a novel scatterometry method that is sensitive to very low level of LER. This method is based on design of a special test structure which can show better sensitivities than the basic noise levels of the tool. The basic idea in this design is the calibration of the scatterometry measurement on a series of sites with LER steps. It will be shown that LER changes of about 1 nm can be detected based on these designed test structures. This is well below the normal capabilities of current optical tools.", "The necessity for and validity of the bias-free line-edge roughness (LER) evaluation are examined. In a typical case, the LER obtained by the conventional method is found to contain 10% or more bias caused by noise. That is, the biasfree LER evaluation is needed to achieve absolute measurements. The bias-free method is also shown to be necessary in relative LER measurements. Moreover, the impact of the smoothing (i.e., averaging the signal intensity in x-direction) process on the LER obtained from scanning electron microscope (SEM) image was evaluated quantitatively by using the bias-free LER evaluation algorithm. We found that the smoothing broadens the SEM signal profile and causes a change in the LER value. Under practical conditions, his smoothing-induced LER change was 0.4 nm in the sample used for this study. This can be a large error when measuring a small LER. Finally, a procedure for optimizing the smoothing number used for applying the bias-free LER application was proposed by considering the validity limit of the application and smoothing-induced LER change.", "The importance of LWR/LER has been wildly treated as an important process parameter to obtain good device performance especially entering 45nm era. The accurate estimation of the metrics is even more important as semiconductor fabrication keeps downsizing. In regular LWR/LER measurement by CDSEM, measurement noise is inevitable and causes bias from true roughness. One early bias-reduction roughness measurement method is by J. Villarrubia and B. Bunday [Proc. SPIE 5752, 480 (2005)] in which multiple images with different frame number are collected and averaged to reduce the noise level after edge position aligned (that is only possible in low noise level). Another proposal by A. Yamaguchi, etc. [Proc. SPIE 6152, 61522D (2006)] is curve fitting with a fixed semi-experimental formula to a measurement curve as a function of the number of scan line of summing. Both methods require complicated image/data collection and calculation method to obtain true roughness. We propose a practical and bias-free roughness measurement method here that is improved version of the two methods, and evaluate noise with multiple measurements at the same line which has adequate scan line summing number so that line edge alignment is doable no matter the noise level. We have verified that the noise is close to Gaussian distribution and the true roughness is estimable for different scan line summing number. The obtained true roughness is also verified by TEM picture. The advantage of this method is practical to commercial CDSEM application in combine with simple offline calculation.", "The effects of Line Width Roughness (LWR) on transistor performance are one of the hottest issues in semiconductor industry. However, in most related studies, LWR is considered as the fluctuations of gate lengths and not of resist lines. In this paper, we examine the direct effects of one of the spatial resist LWR parameters, the fractal dimension, on transistor off current deviations for various correlation lengths and gate widths. The aim is to exploit the fractality of LWR in order to link the gap between the LWR of long resist lines and the gate length roughness that affects transistor performance. The used methodology is based on the simulation of both resist lines and transistor operation. The results of the two step methodology are presented for both narrow and wide gates. For the first, it is found that for all correlation lengths, higher fractal dimension (smaller roughness exponent) of the resist line leads to off state currents closer to the nominal value. For wide gates, an interesting differentiation is found at the dependence of the standard deviation from the fractal dimension as correlation length decreases. For sufficiently low correlation length, the behavior is reversed and the low fractal dimension are more beneficial that the higher ones. An explanation of that reverse is provided by means of the dependence of the CD variation on gate width for various fractal dimensions. Finally, the implications of these findings on the dependencies of the yield of transistors on fractal dimension and correlation length are also discussed.", "Specular X-ray reflectivity (SXR) can be used, in the limit of the effective medium approximation (EMA), as a highresolution shape metrology for periodic and irregular patterns on a smooth substrate. The EMA defines as that the density of the solid pattern and the space separating the patterns are averaged together. In this limit the density profile as a function of pattern height obtained by SXR can be used to extract quantitative information on the cross-sectional pattern profile. Here we explore the limitations of SXR as a pattern shape metrology by studying diblock copolymer films with irregularly shaped bicontinuous terraces on quantized flat layers alternating with two polymer blocks. We conclude that SXR can be extended to irregular shaped patterns encountered in current electronic devices as long as average lateral length scale is smaller than coherence length of X-ray source. The detailed cross-sectional profiles of irregular patterns are discussed along with atomic force microscope results.", "This paper presents a new highly sensitive scatterometry based Probe-Pattern Grating (PPG) focus monitor and its printing assessment on an advanced exposure tool. The high sensitivity is achieved by placing transparent lines spaced at the strong focus spillover distance from the centerline of a 90 degree phase-shifted probe line that functions as an interferometer detector. The monitor translates the focus error into the probe line trench depth, which can be measured by scatterometry techniques. The sensitivity of the defocus measurement through scatterometry calibration is around 1.1nm defocus / nm trench depth. This result indicates that the PPG focus monitor from a single wafer focus setting can detect the defocus distance to well under 0.05 Rayleigh Units.", "In lithography and etch processing, the control inputs (dose or gas flow, etc) use the critical dimension measurements from CDSEM as feedback and/or feed forward parameters. Thus the image quality of the metrology tools is critical for controlling litho and etches processes. With wafer size increasing while CD and features shrinking, even tighter controls on CD are required. It has been shown in literature that during 24 hour period, the beam alignment can drift severely enough to cause a shift of over 10 nm in the measured CD. Though auto focus tuning is provided on some CDSEMs, our tests show that, depending on the focus algorithm used, the insitu autofocus may shift from the best focus. In practice, the tuning of CDSEM settings largely depends on the operator's \"eyeball\" judgments, thus the quality of the SEM images is dependent on the judgment of the operators. In this paper, we propose an objective and quantitative image quality monitor for focus monitor based on image processing and optimization. For focus monitor and optimization, a series of through-focus images are taken for a CDSEM tool. By processing the images using image processing toolbox in Matlab, an IFQ (image focus quality) score, used to quantify the image focus quality, is assigned to each image. The fitting of this data to a predefined polynomial can be used to determine best focus. The algorithm is robust and fast, and has been integrated into the existing manufacturing infrastructure for tool performance tracking and monitoring. The paper is organized as following: In the introduction, some background information on CDSEM, as well as existing and alternative image quality monitoring methods are reviewed. In the second part, we introduce the methodology and steps for the new focus monitor. The third part covers the experiments for CDSEM parameter optimization, robustness tests and validation. The next part explains the implementation of the focus monitor in manufacturing environment. In summary, the proposed method for focus monitor is fast, robust and manufacturability.", "Crystal growth and haze formation on photomasks become serious problems in UV lithography. As the wavelength becomes shorter, photons carry more energy, so the chances of having a photochemical reaction become much higher. Pellicle, adhesive, residue from cleaning or resist strip process, and any contaminant in air can react with UV to form unwanted crystals and a haze layer on reticles. These will reduce the light transmission during exposure process. Thus, frequent mask inspection and periodic mask cleaning are needed to overcome these problems. However, these will in turn increase manufacturing cost and reduce mask life. Thus, a proper mask inspection tool is required to provide early warning of haze formation. In this work, we devised a new ellipsometric technique to investigate the inner surface of mask without removing pellicle. Ellipsometry is known to have mono-layer sensitivity and it can be used to measure any film or partial film formed on non-patterned spot in early stage of growth. However, when a pellicle covers the surface of mask, the ellipsometric data reflected from surface are extremely distorted due to the non-normal transmission through the pellicle. Thus, data analysis becomes extremely difficult without knowing the optical properties of pellicles. In order to solve this problem we developed compensation technique in which two blank pellicles are situated in the optical path in a way to compensate the polarization changes caused by the pellicle on mask. With this method, the conventional ellipsometry spectra of {\u0394, \u03a8} are deduced.", "The development of a novel compact EUV spectrophotometer will be presented. The device is capable of measuring reflectance and transmittance spectra of medium scale EUV-optics primary in the spectral range from 12nm to 21nm. Based on a new polychromatic measurement principle, the system uses the direct irradiation of a table-top EUV-source for illuminating the sample and a broad-band spectrograph for detecting the probe and reference beam. Samples can be investigated under different angles of incidence and in respect of lateral dependencies. Typical results of reflectivity investigations of Mo/Si-mirrors and transmitting foils will be shown and compared with reference measurements of certified institutes and calculations.", "Due to the feature size shrinking, the application of 193nm-ArF scanner systems with high numerical aperture (NA) and the use of resolution enhancement technologies (RET) have been essential for obtaining the desired pattern accuracy on a wafer. Thus the complexity and volume of data required for masks have been rapidly increasing. Moreover, the complexity of mask pattern makes mask inspection increasingly more difficult. The most annoying problem relating to the sensitivity of inspection system is the encountering of false signals arising from nuisance defects. Setting up thresholds in the defect detection algorithm is a difficult task between high sensitivity and less false defect detection. In addition, the effect of variations in defect printability which is strongly dependent on defect types and position must be considered in order to correctly evaluate mask defect inspection procedures. In order to overcome the problems we have previously proposed new algorithm for die-to-wafer-like image (D-to-WI) in real time. This inspection method compares the die, i.e. the wafer image calculated from CAD data, with the wafer-like image calculated from the mask images detected by the mask inspection system. This paper described optimum mask inspection optics for the D-to-WI mask inspection. We verify the optimum mask inspection optics with numerical simulation for various NA and partial coherence of illumination (\u03c3) in the mask inspection optics. The simulated result shows that the optimum mask inspection optics has NA 0.9 and \u03c3=1 for ArF-6%-PSM (Phase Shift Mask) 65/65 nm Line/Space pattern of 193nm-ArF scanner with NA 0.92. In this case the difference of the critical dimensions (CDs) found by D-to-WI and rigorous simulation results from CAD data was less than 1.5nm.", "As PSM (Phase Shift Mask) process moves toward 45nm and 32nm node, phase control is becoming more important than ever. Both attenuated and alternating PSM need precise control of phase as a function of both pitch and target sizes. However conventional interferometer-based phase shift measurements are limited to large CD targets and requires custom designed target in order to function properly, which limits clear understanding and control of small target PSM features. New type of Phase metrology tool created by Zeiss, in collaboration with Intel has been introduced and Intel's 45nm node PSM targets have been measured. In this paper we present test results from AAPSM/EAPSM targets with space CDs down to 45nm a wafer-level. Smallest pitch was 300nm print pitch, 150nm CD at mask (75nm pitch at wafer). In addition to this, phase and transmission matching between conventional phase metrology tool and new tool has been investigated and shown.", "STARlight2+TM (SL2+) is a new high-resolution contamination inspection system based upon the KLA-Tencor TerascanHR platform. Building upon the proven technology of STARlightTM (SL2), SL2+ uses transmitted and reflected images to detect potentially yield-limiting contamination defects on photomasks for wafer fabs and mask shops. It extends the contamination inspection capability to the 32nm logic/45nm Half Pitch (HP) technology nodes using the newly developed 72nm pixel image resolution as well as a significantly improved rendering model in the algorithm. In this paper, we present inspection results on a wide variety of photomasks, spanning the 32nm to 110nm technology nodes, in the recently concluded period of Alpha tests on the SL2+ system. The test results show that the sensitivity and the inspection capability of the new SL2+ system have been greatly improved. Such improvement enables wafer fabs and mask shops to inspect and qualify photomasks for 32nm node development and 45nm node production.", "As the design technology node becomes smaller, k1 factor is decreasing below 0.3 and optical proximity correction (OPC) divergence is increasing. The gate critical dimension (CD) control and systematic defect inspection is becoming critical to improving circuit yield. For more accurate OPC verification and systematic defect inspection, design based metrology become increasingly important, because accuracy of simulation based OPC model verification has its limitation. In this paper, we used NGR-2100 as a design based metrology tool to confirm the accuracy of OPC modeling and process window qualification. NGR-2100 uses high energy wide-beam for high speed secondary electron sampling and large field of view. It can measure full chip CD distribution and more accurate process window compared to optical inspection tool. Because of using high energy beam, conducting layer like carbon film should be coated on photo resist patterned sample wafer to prevent local electron charging. However, coated carbon may increase CD variation. By using atomic layer deposition-type TiN layer instead of carbon, CD variation could be reduced.", "We proposed a novel method (DBB: Designed Based Binning) by using design and defect inspection information to detect marginal design features. This method was used to identify a pattern failure problem (hammer head) which occurred during production early ramp (65 nm device). The traditional approach could not detect this hammerhead problem due to the intermittent nature and low defect count. This problem was identified by DBB methodology which showed problem root cause as a combination of lithography process conditions drift and marginal OPC issues. This use case proved that by using DBB to identify weak pattern features, it provides a common platform for designer, OPC and process engineer to communicate and identify design related problems faster. This method has helped integration engineer shorten process development time, supported product engineer to ramp new product faster and enabled defect engineer to detect excursion earlier. Overall, advanced manufacturing fab will achieve higher yield by adopting this.", "Critical dimension small angle X-ray scattering (CD-SAXS) is a metrology platform capable of measuring the average cross section and line width roughness (LWR) with a sub-nm precision in test patterns with line widths ranging from 10 to 500 nm. The X-ray diffraction intensities from a collimated X-ray beam of sub-Angstrom wavelength were collected and analyzed to determine line width, pitch, sidewall angle, LWR, and others structural parameters. The capabilities of lab-scale and synchrotron-based CD-SAXS tools for LWR characterization were tested by measuring a set of identical patterns with designed roughness amplitude and frequency. These test patterns were fabricated using EUV lithography with sub-50 nm linewidths. To compensate for the limited photon flux from the lab-based X-ray source, the incident beam of the lab system was collimated to a less extent than the synchrotron beam-based tool. Consequently, additional desmearing is needed to extract information from data obtained from lab-based equipment. We report the weighted nonlinear least-squares algorithm developed for this purpose, in addiiton to a comparison between the results obtained from our lab system and the synchrotron beam-based tool.", "Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) is an indispensable production tool enabling successful extension of photolithography down to sub-80nm regime. Commercial OPC software has established clear procedures to produce accurate OPC models at best focus condition. However, OPC models calibrated at best focus condition sometimes fail to prevent catastrophic circuit failure due to patterning short & open caused by accidental shifts of dose/ focus within the corners of allowed processes window. A novel model-based OPC verification methodology is presented in this work, which precisely pinpoints post OPC photolithography failures in VLSI circuits through the entire lithographic process window. By application of a critical photolithography process window model in OPC verification software, we successfully uncovered all weak points of a design prior tape out, eliminating high risk of circuits open & shorts at the extreme corner of the lithographic process window in any complex circuit layout environment. The process window-related information is usually not taken into consideration when running OPC verification procedures with models calibrated at nominal process condition. Intensive review of the critical dimension (CD) and top-view SEM micrographs from the weak points indicate matching between post OPC simulation and measurements. Using a single highly accurate process window resist model provides a reliable OPC verification methodology when used in a field- or grid-based simulation engine ensuring manufacturability within the largest possible process window for any modern critical design.", "The amplitude setpoint affects the critical dimension measurement with CD-AFM. The setpoint amplitude is the amplitude of the resonant oscillation of the AFM tip maintained by the feedback loop as it scans the surface. The Setpoint therefore decides the tip-surface distance, and the tip-surface interaction force as well. Normally, the tip moves an unknown distance away from the sample surface. Such a tip-sample distance on the top and bottom surface is cancelled out in height measurement. In width measurement, however, the tip-sample distance on the left and right sidewall will add up to produce a bias in the measured CD values. The bias will appear in the opposite way and by the same amount in line and trench measurement. We conducted the experiments to see the effect, and found out there exists the dependence of the measured linewidths on the setpoint in the consistent behavior as our hand-waving predicts. The effect may be a significant uncertainty source in the CD-AFM metrology.", "This paper reports on new developments of advanced CD AFM probes after the prior introduction of \"trident probes\" in SPIE Advanced Lithography 2007 [1]. Trident probes, having sharpened extensions in the tip apex region, make possible bottom CD measurements within a few nanometers of the feature bottom corner; an area where other CD probes have difficulties due to tip shape limitations. Moreover, new metrology applications of trident probes have been developed for novel devices such as FinFET and vertical read/write hard disk heads. For ever smaller technology nodes, new probes evolved from the design of the trident probe. For example, the number of sharpened tip flares was reduced from three (trident) to two (bi-pod) to prevent possible interference of the third leg in the slow scan direction, as shown in Figure 3. Maintaining tip lateral stiffness as the tip size shrinks to less than 30 nm is vital for successful scanning. Consequently, a significant recent improvement is the change of probe shank cross-sectional geometry in order to maintain tip vertical aspect ratio of 1:5 (and lateral stiffness > 1 N/m). Finally, modifications of probe substrate are proposed and evaluated for current and new CD AFM systems. Hydrophobic, self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings were applied on CD probes to reduced tip \"pull-away\" distance1 during CD AFM scanning. Test results show that the pull away distance can be reduced more than 5 times on average (in some cases, by a factor of 15). Consequently, use of hydrophobic SAM coatings on CD probes mitigates pull-away distance thus allowing narrow trench CD measurements. We discuss limitations of prior CD AFM probes and design considerations of new CD probes. The characterization of first prototypes and evaluation of scan performance are presented in this work.", "Strong candidate lithography for the mass production of devices at the 32nm technology node and beyond is extreme ultra violet lithography (EUVL). The mask used in EUVL is a complex set of layers. The material composition and thickness of each layer should be considered explicitly in an attempt to model the deposited energy in the resist film during fabrication of mask features using electron-beam lithography. Targeting to sub-32nm technology even with the reduction by 4 of the mask features on the wafer level, lithography should consider accurate fabrication features on the mask level of the order of 50nm. Therefore, detailed simulation of the electron-beam fabrication process, as well as the resist dissolution mechanism and etching is demanding. In this work an attempt is initiated targeting in combining two simulation techniques i.e., the electron-beam simulation, with the stochastic lithography simulation, in a common simulation platform. This way it will be possible to get detailed information of the fine details of the fabricated features, taking into account the multilayer substrate of the mask, and the resist material properties. The e-beam simulation algorithm is presented and used to expose a layout. The calculated energy deposition in the resist level, initially determined considering resist material to be continuous, is used in the discrete representation of the resist. With appropriate threshold in the exposure energy, also acid diffusion could be taken into consideration. Stochastic development of the resist material, delivers line-edge roughness (LER) and critical dimension (CD) on the resist level, in terms of polymer chain architecture.", "The model-based library (MBL) matching technique was applied in hardmask linewidth metrology with a criticaldimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM). The MBL matching measures the edge positions and shapes of samples by comparing simulated images to measured images. To achieve reliable, stable measurements, two important simulation parameters were determined empirically. One was the beam width, and the other was a material parameter, the residual energy loss rate. This parameter is especially important for measurement of hardmask patterns, which have relatively high SEM image contrast. These simulation parameters were estimated so as to fit to actual SEM images, and then pinned to the estimated values during MBL matching. Hardmask patterns made of Si3N4 were measured by MBL matching with the estimated parameters. The accuracy of the measurements was evaluated by one-to-one comparison with atomic force microscope (AFM) results. The pattern profile deduced from only the top-down CD-SEM image with MBL matching agreed well with the AFM profile and a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) crosssectional image. The average measurement bias between the MBL matching and AFM results was 1.58 nm for the bottom CD and -0.64 nm for the top CD, with a standard deviation of about 1.3 nm.", "CD-SEM measurement of linewidth, while providing good relative results, is not completely accurate. The measurements involve significant bias of the SEM signal at line edges. The bias varies depending on the SEM setup, the materials and profiles of patterns on the wafer, as well as charging. Existing methods of CD-SEM calibration are extremely limited, only being available for specific samples and materials. In this paper, simulations of SEM signal were carried out using advanced Monte Carlo models of electron interactions with samples. The linewidth was simulated for a variety of pattern materials and SEM setups. The corresponding linewidths were extracted. A CD bias was determined for each type of measurement. When a 3D pattern is exactly known in simulation, the SEM signal can be related to the pattern; then the bias can be found for any combination of SEM patterns. This has the potential to greatly improve CDSEM accuracy, toward the goal of absolute linewidth measurements.", "SEM microscopy is a primary method for CD measurements of features on sub-micron scale. The process of feature characterization using SEM involves several steps that include image acquisition, image processing, image analysis and data analysis. Each one of these steps carries an error margin that contributes to the overall accuracy of measurements. While performing measurements at the nanoscale resolution the accuracy of the process becomes even more critical for obtaining accurate measurements, and needs to be determined and understood. Using object with known dimensions such as linewidth of an isolated polycrystalline (\"poly\") Si lines be useful for evaluating accuracy of the characterization process and calibrating SEM instrument. Reference materials for such evaluation are being developed by NIST. To use this approach successfully it is important to understand metrology issues involved in the image characterization process. This work will review the scope of metrology issues involved in the process of linewidth measurement using SEM imaging including image acquisition, image processing and segmentation, as well as data extraction and analysis using image analysis methods. We will review and discuss methods for evaluating accuracy throughout characterization process and obtaining reliable and repeatable measurements. The scope of study includes the use of two dimensional simulation and modeling of SEM line images, methods for grayscale image processing and segmentation, algorithms for obtaining statistically accurate linewidth measurements from the image that can be used for instrument calibration and inter-laboratory studies and are generally applicable for obtaining CD measurements of line features.", "In our previous paper*[1], next generation lithography offering improved resolution by use of Hyper-NA and Low-k1, changes in exposure tool focus were seen to influence pattern shape and it was verified that pattern profile variation occurs even when measured CD values are similar. This shows the necessity for process control to include pattern shape information, conventional methods using the CD value alone will be insufficient as process latitudes continue to shrink. In such a situation, to be able to precisely measure the physical dimensions of design features becomes more and more important. In this study, we have investigated improved precision of Process Window (PW) determination by using the MPPC function that allows the pattern profile shape to be quantified. We have also evaluated pattern shape variation by means of Litho-simulation. As a result, it was confirmed that resist loss is the main change in shape that occurs. Therefore, we have focused our attention on resist loss and optimized the MPPC parameters by SEM simulation*[2]. As a consequence, it was possible to precisely detect the resist loss. Using this technique, it was possible to show the possibility for highly precise 3D measurement determination, for use in exposure tool monitoring, by using the MPPC measurement technique.", "Multiple Gate Field Effect Transistors (MuGFETs) have been proposed to enable downsizing, when scaling the transistors to the 32nm technology node. The dimension of the gate on the surface of fin determines the effective channel length of the device. So, the characterization of the gate profiles at fin sidewalls becomes extremely critical. It is especially important to quantify the rounded intersection (etch residual) at the intersection of the fin and gate. In this report, we show top down images of a MuGFET taken with critical-dimension scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) and the results that were measured and characterized by measuring various portions of the pattern which will impact the MuGFET performance i.e. gate length, fin width. We will introduce a quantified relation between fin length and \"its effect on the etch residue at the intersection of fin and gate\". Next we discuss our approaches to analyze the variation of the shape of the gate at the fin sidewall.", "As advanced semiconductor companies move forward to the 45nm technology node, traditional overlay sampling and linear correction used in dry lithography become less feasible to bring overlay control into the desired budget. New overlay control methodologies need to be established to meet the needs of much tighter overlay budgets in the immersion lithography process. Overlay source of variance (SOV) was first investigated to understand the major contributor of overlay error sources. The SOVis broken down into wafer, field, and random components in order to utilize the SOV information to prioritize overlay improvement decisions. High order wafer level or field level error components are commonly observed as a significant contributor and requires attention to bring the overlay residual into the desired limit. Optimal sample is determined in considering sample plan robustness and throughput impact while increasing sampling becomes a necessity in 45nm technology node.", "As the semiconductor industry continues to drive towards high volume production at the 50nm technology node and beyond, there are formidable barriers imposed not only from technical challenges but also from economic challenges related to controlling overlay tightly enough to meet the strict requirements of a increasingly smaller overlay control window. In this paper, the authors will show potential sources overlay error for a 50nm node process and detail a methodology to pinpoint the root cause and an application to help reduce these errors to facilitate the ramp of a new process technology for high volume DRAM/FLASH manufacturing. In short, based on a series of experiments and analysis, the authors have identified high-order wafer-level residual component to be the main contribution of the high residuals with the source attributed to the scanner mix-and-match set. In turn, an overlay control approach using high order correctables generated from the overlay metrology system and fed through the APC system will be able to effectively reduce the mix-and-match high residual errors.", "The newly emerging lithographic technologies related to the 32nm node and below will require a step function in the overlay metrology performance, due to the dramatic shrinking of the error budgets. In this work, we present results of an emerging alternative technology for overlay metrology - Differential signal scatterometry overlay (SCOTM). The technique is based on spectroscopic analysis of polarized light, reflected from a \"grating-on-grating\" target. Based on theoretical analysis and initial data, this technology, as well as broad band bright field overlay, is a candidate technology that will allow achieving the requirements of the 32nm node and beyond it. We investigate the capability of SCOLTM to control overlay in a production environment, on complex stacks and process, in the context of advanced DRAM and Flash technologies. We evaluate several metrology mark designs and the effect on the metrology performance, in view of the tight TMU requirements of the 32nm node. The results - achieved on the KLA-Tencor's Archer tool, equipped with both broad band bright field AIMTM and scatterometry SCOLTM sensors - indicate the capability of the SCOLTM technology to satisfy the advanced nodes requirements.", "As a design rule shrink down aggressively, various RETs (Resolution Enhancement Technology) have been developed to extend the resolution limits of lithography. Until now, next generation lithography has been focused on EUV technology. But no one can assure when EUV will be implemented. So, we must develop new technology with current immersion tool to catch up with aggressive design rule. One of those is DPT (Double Patterning Technology), however there are also many challenges to overcome such as patterning, overlay, hard mask etch and so on. The most critical issue would be overlay, because it affects CD (Critical dimension) uniformity directly. Therefore, overlay control is very important between 1st DP layer and 2nd DP layer. We utilized ArF immersion scanners for this experiment. In this paper, DP process flow, hard mask film dependency, align method dependency, efforts of new align key design and direct align analysis in DP overlay will be reported to understand and get better overlay accuracy than tool specification. It is needed to be verified that how much they take an effect on improving the DP overlay. Continuously we can conclude that most efforts in DPT should be focused on overlay control issue.", "Overlay metrology and control have been critical for successful advanced microlithography for many years, and are taking on an even more important role as time goes on. Due to throughput constraints it is necessary to sample only a small subset of overlay metrology marks, and typical sample plans are static over time. Standard production monitoring and control involves measuring sufficient samples to calculate up to 6 linear correctables. As design rules shrink and processing becomes more complex, however, it is necessary to consider higher order modeled terms for control, fault detection, and disposition. This in turn, requires a higher level of sampling. Due to throughput concerns, however, careful consideration is needed to establish a base-line sampling, and higher levels of sampling can be considered on an exception-basis based on automated trigger mechanisms. The goal is improved scanner control and lithographic cost of ownership. This study addresses tools for establishing baseline sampling as well as motivation and initial results for dynamic sampling for application to higher order modeling.", "Critical processing factors in the lithography process include overlaying the pattern properly to previous layers and properly exposing the pattern to achieve the desired line width. Proper overlay can only be attained in the lithography process while the desired line width accuracy is achieved by both lithography and etch processes. Since CD is substantially influenced by etch processing, therefore, it is possible to say that overlay is one of the most important processing elements in the lithography process. To achieve the desired overlay accuracy, it is desirable to expose critical layers with the same exposure tool that exposed the previous or target layer. This need to dedicate a particular exposure tool, however, complicates the lot dispatching schedule and, even worse, decreases exposure tool utilization. In order to allow any exposure tool available to print the arriving lot, M&M (Mix and Match) overlay control becomes necessary. By reducing overlay errors in M&M control, lot dispatching scheduling will become more flexible and exposure tool utilization will improve. Since each exposure tool has a unique registration signature, high order errors appear when overlaying multiple layers exposed with different tools. Even with the same exposure tool, if a different illumination is used, a similar error will be seen. A correction scheme to make the signature differences has to be implemented, however manually characterizing each tool's signature per illumination condition is extremely tedious, and is subject human errors. The challenge is to design a system to perform the corrections automatically. In the previous paper(1), we have outlined concepts of the system scheme. The system has subsequently been developed and tested using exposure tools. In this paper test results are shown using automated distortion correction. By analyzing the results, suggestions for further improvements and further developments are shown.", "Applications that require overlay measurement between layers separated by absorbing interlayer films (such as \u03b1- carbon) pose significant challenges for sub-50nm processes. In this paper scatterometry methods are investigated as an alternative to meet these stringent overlay metrology requirements. In this article, a spectroscopic Diffraction Based Overlay (DBO) measurement technique is used where registration errors are extracted from specially designed diffraction targets. DBO measurements are performed on detailed set of wafers with varying \u03b1-carbon (ACL) thicknesses. The correlation in overlay values between wafers with varying ACL thicknesses will be discussed. The total measurement uncertainty (TMU) requirements for these layers are discussed and the DBO TMU results from sub-50nm samples are reviewed.", "In immersion lithography process, film stacking architecture will be necessary due to film peeling. However, the architecture will restrict lithographic area within a wafer due to top side EBR accuracy In this paper, we report an effective film stacking architecture that also allows maximum lithographic area. This study used a new bevel rinse system on RF3 for all materials to make suitable film stacking on the top side bevel. This evaluation showed that the new bevel rinse system allows the maximum lithographic area and a clean wafer edge. Patterning defects were improved with suitable film stacking.", "Challenges in back-end-of-line process flow are becoming more critical as the 65 and 45 nm process control requirements become more stringent. Unoptimized copper CMP processing contributes to a significant portion of yield losses downstream, if electrical device performance does not address the technology node targets. Adequate metrology is required to meet the challenge of consistent wafer uniformity control in removing the excess copper on 300 mm wafers while preserving the material interface dielectrics at sub-nanometer levels. Dishing of the metal lines, which show the predictive nature of isolated in-die metal line loss, and erosion of the dielectric oxide across multiple oxide-metal line arrays are two key parameters indicative of the planarization process. As feature sizes continue to shrink, micro-dishing and edge-over-erosion become important to characterize and control. For process development, the knowledge of the macro and micro planarity will be increasingly essential to preventing lithography depth of focus issues. In manufacturing, the need for CMP process stability increases as a process excursion could occur at any time. In-line monitoring of macro and micro-level surface topography, dishing, erosion, micro-dishing, and edge-over-erosion parameter values allows fine tuning, optimization, and process control.", "Semiconductor manufacturing technology has shifted towards finer design rules, and demands for critical dimension uniformity (CDU) of resist patterns have become greater than ever. One of the methods for improving CDU of resist pattern is to control the temperature of post-exposure bake (PEB). When ArF resist is used, there is a certain relationship between critical dimension (CD) and PEB temperature. By utilizing this relationship, Resist Pattern CDU can be improved through control of within-wafer temperature distribution in the PEB process. We have already applied this method to Resist Pattern CDU improvement and have achieved these results. In this evaluation, we aim at: 1. Clarifying the relationship between the improvement in Resist Pattern CDU through PEB temperature control and the improvement in Etching Pattern CDU. 2. Verifying whether Resist Pattern CDU improvement through PEB temperature control has any effect on the reduction in wiring resistance variation. The evaluation procedure is: 1. Preparation of wafers with base film of doped Poly-Si (D-Poly). 2. Creation of two sets of samples on the base, a set of samples with good Resist Pattern CDU and a set of samples with poor Resist Pattern CDU. 3. Etching of the two sets under the same conditions. 4. Measurements of CD and wiring resistance. We used Optical CD Measurement (OCD) for measurement of resist pattern and etching pattern for the reason that OCD is minimally affected by Line Edge Roughness (LER). As a result, we found that; 1. The improvement in Resist Pattern CDU leads to the improvement in Etching Pattern CDU . 2. The improvement in Resist Pattern CDU has an effect on the reduction in wiring resistance variation. There is a cause-and-effect relationship between wiring resistance variation and transistor characteristics. From this relationship, we expect that the improvement in Resist Pattern CDU through PEB temperature control can contribute to device performance improvement.", "The concern over molecular contamination on the surfaces of optics continues to grow. Most recently, this concern has focused on siloxane contamination resulting from hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) which is commonly used as a wafer treatment to improve photoresist adhesion onto wafers. From this process, HMDS vapor can be found within FABs and process tools where it has been linked to issues related to lens hazing. This type of surface contamination is significantly detrimental to the imaging process and is generally corrected by extensive surface cleaning or even lens replacement. Additionally, this type of repair also requires adjustment of the optical axis, thereby contributing to an extended downtime. HMDS is known to be very sensitive to the presence of water and is therefore believed to degrade in humid airstreams. This research focuses on rationalizing the reaction mechanisms of HMDS in dry and humid airstreams and in the presence of several adsorbent surfaces. It is shown that HMDS hydrolyzes in humid air to trimethylsilanol (TMS) and ammonia (NH3). Furthermore, it is shown that TMS can dimerize in air, or on specific types of adsorption media, to form hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO). Additionally, we report on the relative impact of these reaction mechanisms on the removal of both HMDS and its hydrolysis products (TMS, HMDSO and NH3).", "Recently, stressed silicon wafers have begun being used and it is necessary to measure the strain in the surface film for process control. We developed a stress measurement system with a built in film thickness measurement tool. In pursuing this development we concentrated on the high-throughput and stable results required for semiconductor process control tools. We achieved the desired results by using a collimator in the microscope. Our system can measure the stress in 1 dimension line on a 300 mm wafer in less than 30 seconds. Then we proceed to measure wafer patterns with the same system. We describe this system and the measurement data it provides.", "Semiconductor manufacturing technology has shifted towards finer design rules, and demands for critical dimension uniformity (CDU) of resist patterns have become greater than ever. One of the methods for improving Resist Pattern CDU is to control post-exposure bake (PEB) temperature. When ArF resist is used, there is a certain relationship between critical dimension (CD) and PEB temperature. By utilizing this relationship, Resist Pattern CDU can be improved through control of within-wafer temperature distribution in the PEB process. Resist Pattern CDU improvement contributes to Etching Pattern CDU improvement to a certain degree. To further improve Etching Pattern CDU, etcher-specific CD variation needs to be controlled. In this evaluation, 1. We verified whether etcher-specific CD variation can be controlled and consequently Etching Pattern CDU can be further improved by controlling resist patterns through PEB control. 2. Verifying whether Etching Pattern CDU improvement through has any effect on the reduction in wiring resistance variation. The evaluation procedure is as follows.1. Wafers with base film of Doped Poly-Si (D-Poly) were prepared. 2. Resist patterns were created on them. 3. To determine etcher-specific characteristics, the first etching was performed, and after cleaning off the resist and BARC, CD of etched D-Poly was measured. 4. Using the obtained within-wafer CD distribution of the etching patterns, within-wafer temperature distribution in the PEB process was modified. 5. Resist patterns were created again, followed by the second etching and cleaning, which was followed by CD measurement. We used Optical CD Measurement (OCD) for measurement of resist patterns and etching patterns as OCD is minimally affected by Line Edge Roughness (LER). As a result, 1. We confirmed the effect of Resist Pattern CD control through PEB control on the reduction in etcher-specific CD variation and the improvement in Etching Pattern CDU. 2. The improvement in Etching Pattern CDU has an effect on the reduction in wiring resistance variation. The method for Etching Pattern CDU improvement through PEB control reduces within-wafer variation of MOS transistor's gate length. Therefore, with this method, we can expect to observe uniform within-wafer MOS transistor characteristics.", "A shrinking design rule has decreased film thickness specifications and is creating challenges as multi-layer structures and new materials are introduced. We have developed a spectroscopic ellipsometer, the RE-5200, which can measure several parameters with spot sizes down to 30 um. The advantages of the RE-5200 include high long-term stability, high accuracy, short measurement time, and low COO. The high precision aspheric mirrors were developed specifically for this system and allow the measurement of very small areas on the device. In addition, the stress measurement function meets some of the latest demands, which are high throughput, high accuracy and pattern independent. This paper presents the optical design and performance of the RE-5200, including measurement results.", "We proposed an in-situ method to control the wafer spatial temperature uniformity during thermal cycling of silicon substrate in the lithography sequence. These thermal steps are usually conducted by the placement of the substrate on the heating plate for a given period of time. We have previously proposed an approach for controling the steady-state wafer temperature uniformity in steady-state. In this paper, we extend the approach by considering the dynamic properties of the system. A detailed physical model of the thermal system is first developed by considering energy balances on the system. Next, by monitoring the bake-plate temperature and fitting the data into the model, the temperature of the wafer can be estimated and controlled in real-time. This is useful as production wafers usually do not have temperature sensors embedded on it, these bake-plates are usually calibrated based on test wafers with embedded sensors. However, as processes are subjected to process drifts, disturbances, and wafer warpages, real-time correction of the bake-plate temperatures to achieve uniform wafer temperature is not possible in current baking systems. Any correction is done based on run-to-run control techniques which depends on the sampling frequency of the wafers. Our approach is real-time and can correct for any variations in the desired wafer temperature performance during both transient and steady state. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.", "The objective of this work is the creation of predictive models that can forecast the electrical or physical parameters of wafers using data collected from the relevant processing tools. In this way, direct measurements from the wafer can be minimized or eliminated altogether, hence the term \"virtual\" metrology. Challenges include the selection of the appropriate process step to monitor, the pre-treatment of the raw data, and the deployment of a Virtual Metrology Model (VMM) that can track a manufacturing process as it ages. A key step in any VM application is dimensionality reduction, i.e. ensuring that the proper subset of predictors is included in the model. In this paper, a software tool developed with MATLAB is demonstrated for interactive data prescreening and selection. This is combined with a variety of automated statistical techniques. These include step-wise regression and genetic selection in conjunction with linear modeling such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Squares (PLS). Modeling results based on industrial datasets are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods.", "Recently several DBMs(Design Based Metrologies) are introduced for the wafer verification and feed back to DFM. The major applications of DBM are OPC accuracy feed back, process window qualification and advanced process control feed back. In general, however, DBM brings out huge amount of measurement data and it is necessary to provide special server system for uploading and handling the raw data. And since it also takes much time and labor to analyze the raw data for valuable feed back, it is desirable to connect to EDA tools such as OPC tools or MBV(Model Based Verification) tools for data analysis. If they can communicate with a common language between them, the DBM measurement result can be sent back to OPC or MBV tools for better model calibration. For advanced process control of wafer CDU, DBM measurement results of field CDU can be fed back to scanner for illumination uniformity correction. In this work, we discuss tool integration of DBM with other tools like EDA tools. These tool integrations are targeted for the verification procedure automation and as a result for faster and more exact analysis of measurement data. The procedures of tool integration and automatic data conversion between them will be presented in detail.", "The objective of this study was to examine the defect reduction effect of the wafer edge polishing step on the immersion lithography process. The experimental wafers were processed through a typical front end of line device manufacturing process and half of the wafers were processed with the wafer edge polishing just prior to the immersion lithography process. The experimental wafers were then run through two immersion lithography experiments and the defect adders on these wafers were compared and analyzed. The experimental results indicated a strong effect of the edge polishing process on reducing the particle migration from the wafer edge region to the wafer surface during the immersion lithography process.", "The traditional approach to semiconductor wafer inspection is based on the use of stand-alone metrology tools, which while highly sensitive, are large, expensive and slow, requiring inspection to be performed off-line and on a lot sampling basis. Due to the long cycle times and sparse sampling, the current wafer inspection approach is not suited to rapid detection of process excursions that affect yield. The semiconductor industry is gradually moving towards deploying integrated metrology tools for real-time \"monitoring\" of product wafers during the manufacturing process. Integrated metrology aims to provide end-users with rapid feedback of problems during the manufacturing process, and the benefit of increased yield, and reduced rework and scrap. The approach of monitoring 100% of the wafers being processed requires some trade-off in sensitivity compared to traditional standalone metrology tools, but not by much. This paper describes a compact, low-cost wafer defect monitor suitable for integrated metrology applications and capable of detecting submicron defects on semiconductor wafers at an inspection rate of about 10 seconds per wafer (or 360 wafers per hour). The wafer monitor uses a whole wafer imaging approach to detect defects on both un-patterned and patterned wafers. Laboratory tests with a prototype system have demonstrated sensitivity down to 0.3 \u00b5m on un-patterned wafers and down to 1 \u00b5m on patterned wafers, at inspection rates of 10 seconds per wafer. An ideal application for this technology is preventing photolithography defects such as \"hot spots\" by implementing a wafer backside monitoring step prior to exposing wafers in the lithography step.", "The demands on optical metrology of etched structures continue to increase as microelectronics become more complex and use higher aspect ratios. We will show the ability of the Dainippon Screen trench measurement tool to measure linear trench device dimensions, such as trench depth, width monitoring, and mesa oxide thickness, with high precision and accuracy. The advantages of our tool are high throughput, cost effectiveness and ease of use, because of its optimization using an optical interference calculation. This tool used has demonstrated repeatability on the order of 3\u03c3 < 1 nm in Trench Depth and SiO2 thickness measurements.", "We proposed a model for highly sensitive detection of residue defects in electron beam defect inspection of photo resist patterns on a metal hard mask and verified the principle of that model. When there are photo resist residue defects on the bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC), the thickness of total organic layer is thicker at the defect pattern than in areas where there is no residue. The model proposed here focuses on this increase in layer thickness. The landing energy of the primary electrons allows electron penetration to the under layer (TiN) in the patterns where there is no defect (thin layer), but does not allow such penetration in the defective patterns (thick layer). In that landing energy region, SEM image contrast differs according to the primary electron penetration or nonpenetration in the non-defective patterns and in the defective patterns. This method detects defects according to the contrast change (penetration contrast method). The principle of this model (i.e., the penetration contrast method) is verified in this report. The behavior of the defect that caused with the variation of an actual exposure condition was compared with this method and without this method. This method was also applied for quantitative detection of defects considered to be caused by dose amount of lithography process. This method was shown to be clearly effective in ADI for the metal hard mask.", "In advanced DRAM manufacturing, the process scaling to increase memory cell density creates a difficult challenge for conventional optical or SEM metrology tools to characterize wafer surface profiles after plasma etching. Dry plasma etch processes are used to form critical contact plugs within a stacked capacitor DRAM cell, two of which will be discussed in this article. One contact plug connects a buried digit line to an active area in array, while another contact plug connects a capacitor container to an active area through the first plug. In both cases, the etched surface structure features a complex three-dimensional (3D) topography with a minimum space at ~50nm (see Figure 1). Etch profiles are directly related to the DRAM yield and must be monitored inline. Scanning probe based atomic force microscopy (AFM) is particularly beneficial for this type of dimension measurements. This article presents the methodology and recent results of applying AFM as inline metrology for contact etch control at 70nm node and below. AFM is an advanced, high-resolution 3D imaging tool. It provides nondestructive and direct in-die measurements of the active circuit region on product wafers at the contact etch steps and other critical process layers. Calculated automatically from AFM images, the dry etch depth is used as inline metrology for process control and is a critical metric for process optimization.", "The merits of hyper NA imaging using 193nm exposure wavelength with water immersion for 45nm is clear. Scanner focus and dose control is always improving to allow small DOF manufacturing in immersion lithography. However, other process parameters can affect focus and dose control and a real-time monitor capability to detect local focus and exposure conditions on production wafers is required. In this paper we evaluated a focus-exposure monitor technique based on Spectroscopic Critical Dimension (SCD) metrology following the promising results obtained by Kelvin Hung [1] et al. The key attributes of this technique are the implementation on standard production wafers, the high sensitivity to pattern profile modifications and the unique capability of spectroscopic ellipsometry to provide all the information needed to decouple the effects on pattern formation coming from process variations of Advanced Patterning Films (APF) [2], largely adopted for 65/45nm patterning, from coating and, finally, from the pure scanner imaging contributors like focus and exposure. We will present the characterization of this technique for 2 critical layers: active and contacts of a non-volatile memory device, 45nm technology.", "We measured the pitch of a 144-nm pitch, two-dimensional grid in two different laboratories. Optical Diffraction gave very high accuracy for mean pitch and Atomic Force Microscopy measured individual pitch values, gaining additional information about local pitch variation. The measurements were made traceable to the international meter. Optical diffraction gave mean value 143.928 \u00b1 0.015 nm (95% confidence limit, per GUM). AFM gave mean value 143.895 \u00b1 0.079 nm. Individual pitch values had standard deviation 0.55 nm and expanded uncertainty \u00b1 1.1 nm. Mean values measured by the two methods agreed within 0.033 nm. Because this was less than the uncertainty due to random variation in the AFM results, it suggests that the AFM measuring and analysis procedures have successfully corrected all systematic errors of practical significance in microscopy. We also discuss what precision may be expected from the AFM method when it is applied to measure smaller pitches.", "In this paper, a scatterometry software named ODP(R) by Timbre Technologies was used to develop BEOL applications to measure the trench and complicated dual damascene structures. Diffraction spectra were collected with Nanometrics normal incidence polarized reflectometer system in the wavelength range of 220~800nm. The measured spectra were analyzed and used as target spectra by ODP-PAS(R) system. Then the associated models were built to generate the simulated spectra which were used to match the measured spectra. We studied four different structures related to the post trench-and-via etch and post copper CMP processes, including two two-dimensional (2D) line\\space structures and two three-dimensional (3D) trench-over-via dual damascene structures. Cross-section TEM (transmitted electron microscopy) measurements were performed to evaluate the performance of ODP measurements. The results show that the correlation between TEM and ODP of CD measurements is good, and the correlation between TEM and ODP of the trench depth measurements is also good. ODP is able to measure the trench and complicated dual damascene structures and further to be used to optimize the process conditions.", "With the advancement of lithography, the overlay budget is becoming extremely tight. As the accuracy of overlay is important for achieving a good yield, the demand for the accuracy of overlay is ever increasing. According to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), the overlay control budget for the 32nm technology node will be 5.7nm. The overlay metrology budget is typically 1/10 of the overlay control budget resulting in overlay metrology total measurement uncertainty (TMU) requirements of 0.57nm for the most challenging use cases of the 32nm node. The current state of the art imaging overlay metrology technology does not meet this strict requirement, and further technology development is required to bring it to this level. Especially for exposure tool inspection (e.g. alignment, overlay, wafer stage and distortion), more high accuracy should be required using 'resist to resist' pattern. In this work we simulated the measurement sensitivity for two types of scatterometry based overlay metrology, one is differential signal scatterometry overlay (SCOL), the other is double exposure type (DET).", "As semiconductor technology has advanced, the films have become thinner and changed to multi-layer films, such as gate dielectric construction. To deal with these trends, we are continuing development of our spectroscopic ellipsometer with elliptical polarization. We chose a Rotating-Analyzer Ellipsometer (RAE) configuration. The incident light in this type of device is usually polarized linearly, because polarizers do not disperse the light. But the incident light in the ellipsometer described in this paper is elliptical, which has a nearly circular polarization. In this paper, we introduce a technique for solving the dispersion problem.", "In the sub-90 nm technology nodes, optical metrology techniques are essential for process control of gate formation steps, from lithography to etch layers such as gate, trench, and dielectric interconnect layers and to spacers and straining layer depositions. Conventionally, optical metrology is based on measurements of periodic line or hole arrays (i.e., gratings) using spectroscopic ellipsometers or polarized reflectometers, collecting data across wide wavelength spectra at a single angle of incidence. In this paper, we present results of measurements on periodic etched amorphous-Si gate line arrays using focused beam ellipsometry (FBE), illuminating at three discrete laser wavelengths while data is collected over angles of incidence ranging from 45\u00b0 to 65\u00b0. Results on thoroughly characterized samples representative of 65 and 45 nm technology are presented. These samples include a variety of both line critical dimensions (CDs) (from 18-50 nm) and line pitches (from 200-700nm) for dense and isolated lines arrays. We discuss precision and accuracy in terms of total measurement uncertainty; spot size, navigation, and tool matching are also presented. FBE-based metrology will meet current process control requirements within a substantial margin.", "Optical metrology techniques are essential for process control of the gate formation process steps from lithography to the dielectric, spacers, gate and straining layer deposition in the sub-65nm technology nodes. Traditionally, optical metrology is based on the measurements of periodic lines or hole arrays using a spectroscopic ellipsometer or reflectometer, collecting data across a wavelength range at a single angle of incidence. In this paper, we discuss measurements using Focused Beam Ellipsometry (FBE), illuminating at discrete laser wavelengths while data is collected over a wide angle of incidence range. We verify precision estimates of the different model parameters with actual values obtained from measured data. We show sensitivity ranges for different applications over the space of measured wavelength spectrum from DUV to IR, angle of incidence range, and sample azimuthal orientations. Major factors contributing to the projected recipe performance - wavelength, orientation of the incident beam are discussed.", "The interpretation of scatterometry measurements generally assumes that the grating extends over an area large enough to intercept all the illumination provided by an incident beam. However, in practice, the gratings used in scatterometry are relatively small. Thus, the detected light also includes both that scattered by the grating as well as that from a region surrounding the grating because, generally, the incident beam illuminates both the grating and the surrounding region. To model the effects of such real structures, simulations of the effective reflectance were performed whereby the reflection from the grating was considered to be the sum of the diffraction by the grating and the diffraction of the surrounding region, taking into account the beam profile. To demonstrate the model, the illumination field was assumed to be Gaussian. Results are shown for a specific target design consisting of a 50 \u03bcm square measured by normal incidence reflectometry. Significant errors occur when the incident profile has wings that fall outside of the profile and when the scattered light is partially apertured.", "Optical metrology techniques are essential for process control of gate formation process steps from lithography to the dielectric, spacers, gate and straining layer deposition in sub-90nm technology nodes. Traditionally, optical metrology is based on the measurement of periodic lines or hole arrays using a spectroscopic ellipsometer or reflectometer, collecting data across a wide wavelength spectrum at a single angle of incidence. In this paper, we present results of measurements on periodic Poly-Si gate line arrays using laser based Focused Beam Scatterometry (FBS), illuminating at 3 discrete laser wavelengths while data is collected over an angle of incidence range from 45\u00b0 to 65\u00b0. Accuracy, repeatability, and tool-to-tool matching results for the poly-Si gate line arrays are discussed. Comparison with the CD-SEM and cross-section TEM result for measurement/modeling accuracy is also presented.", "Scatterometry is one of the advanced optical metrology techniques has been implemented in semiconductor manufacturing for monitoring and controlling critical dimensions, sidewall angle and grating heights as well as thicknesses of underlying films, due to its non-destructive nature, high measurement precision and speed. In traditional scatterometry approach, the optical properties (n&k's) of film stack have been used as fixed inputs in a scatterometry model, therefore, the process engineers have to assume that there is no significant impact on measurement results by small deviation from pre-extracted n&k's. However, n&k's of actual production wafers will always vary from the fixed values used in the model. The magnitude of the variations and its impact on the accuracy of scatterometry measurements has not been well-characterized yet. In this study, a low-k dielectric stack with noticeable n&k's variations was generated. The low-k dielectric stack has the refractive index (n) variation around 0.01 @ 633nm within a wafer, and is under two layers of patterned PR and BARC. Different scatterometry models with fixed and floated n&k's have been analyzed. Although comparable repeatability was obtained with either fixed or floated n&k's model, the correlation (R2) to CD-SEM result has been improved by floating n&k in the model in comparison to that of fixed n&k model. In this paper, we also discuss some differences in applying various optical models (i.e, EMA and Cauchy) in scatterometry measurements.", "Gate critical dimension (CD) common window (UDOF) is less than 0.25\u03bcm below 110nm-node. It's a serious impact by scanner leveling tilt due to it'll result in defocus, profile changed and then suffer etch bias. Here, we provide an easy and convenient method to monitor daily leveling tilt of ASML 193nm by SCD. Of course, it can also be used for other vendors' scanner including DUV 248nm, 193nm & immersion 193nm. SCD can measure side wall angle (SWA) of photo resist and it's a factor of focus. We can design one mask with SCD grating pattern and layout them at four corners of mask. Collect the SWA data of four corners by different tilt at x and y direction and then we can find the correlation within SWA bias and leveling. It's an easy method to monitor scanner leveling issue and early alert for excursion case.", "In this paper, we analyze the nonstandard finite-difference time-domain (NS-FDTD) method for the rectangular prismatic and cylindrical medium mounts that are put on the substrate periodically. FDTD is useful for analyzing the light scattering from arbitrary shape grooves and mounts. Using the NS-FDTD algorithms, we can get the deep null in the dispersion error at the design frequency and the error is nearly sixth power of grid size with a same computational cost. First, the 3D NS-FDTD formulation is obtained from Maxwell equation for the conducting medium. We analyze structures of rectangular prismatic and cylindrical mounts on the substrate. We show the propagation characteristic calculated by NS-FDTD. Next, the standard (S) FDTD and NS-FDTD reflectance convergences are checked for the grid size h (=\u0394x=\u0394y=\u0394z) changes. The reflectance is compared with the RCWA results. For the case that the layer lattice and the substrate were the same silicon and had some extinction coefficient, the NS-FDTD reflectance convergences are better than the S-FDTD convergences. Finally, we calculate the reflectance from the cubic and cylindrical periodic mounts put on the silicon substrate.", "Increase of Depth of Focus (DOF) and higher Numerical Aperture (NA), make of immersion lithography a sub-50nm technology node enabler. At the same time it introduces a range of new defect types, also known as immersion defects. According to the ITRS roadmap, the Smallest Defect Of Interest (SDOI) for the 45nm node has a size of 30nm [1] which is the minimal defect size which poses risk to the integrity of the post litho chain processes. A novel approach of Immersion Defectivity Baseline creation and monitoring has been developed for the 45nm technology node by ASML, supported by Applied Materials. An Immersion Defectivity Baseline consists of: a qualified stack, a dedicated defectivity reticle, a Defect Inspection Tool with an optimized inspection recipe, a Defect Review SEM with an optimized defect review recipe and a defect qualification scheme. The new approach to Immersion Defectivity Baseline creation is based on the combined capabilities of highest resolution bright-field inspection and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) review that are available today, with a unique qualification methodology using printed programmed defects that cover the full printable size range. The inspection tool's SDOI detection sensitivity has been optimized for engineering, production as well as monitoring modes, with negligible nuisance rate and basic classification capability followed by highly accurate SEM review and classification. As a result, it enables a stringently controlled, highly efficient, automated defect classification for baseline monitoring and increased productivity. The SEM material analysis sub-apparatus complete the control loop for baseline creation and excursion control. This paper presents a protocol for Immersion Defectivity Baseline creation and control methodologies used for the latest ASML immersion scanner.", "The growing demands of metrology have tightened the allowable tolerances of depth and step height measurements in semiconductor and nanotechnology fabrication. With manufacturing tolerances in the range of 1 nm to 3 nm, special care is required to achieve calibration traceable to the SI (Systeme International d'Unites, or International System of Units) meter in order to meet manufacturing requirements. This paper describes the steps taken to achieve this level of measurement capability. The methodology used to achieve this traceable calibration is to use an inclined plane to establish linearity over the step height range of interest of a reference critical dimension atomic force microscope (CDAFM) and then to link a single traceable step height somewhere within this range. The deviations from perfect linearity in the vertical position are shown in the paper. Then using this newly calibrated reference CD-AFM, various step height structures were used to transfer the traceable calibration from the reference CD-AFM to one-dimensional AFMs (1DAFM) used for manufacturing process control. A traceable step height calibration, with an expanded uncertainty of 2.24 nm (k = 3) is demonstrated for the reference CD-AFM. From this result, a traceable calibration of the manufacturing AFMs with a combined expanded uncertainty of 2.8 nm (k = 3) for a nominal 164 nm step height is developed.", "Patterning of contact hole is always the most difficult process among many types of pattern formations. Specially for the Extreme Ultra-Violet Lithography (EUVL), it will be even more difficult to make perfectly circled contact hole due to the shadow effect. The shape of contact hole will be elliptical because the vertical axis opening is different from the horizontal axis opening. We studied this behavior for 22 nm node contact hole patterns. We varied the pitch of the regular contact hole array. The dependency of the position and density is studied for the random array. In addition to that the thickness of the absorber and the reflectivity of the multilayer are varied to see non-circular contact hole. In order to make desired circular contact hole with uniform width, direction dependent mask bias is applied in addition to the normal optical proximity correction.", "As the advanced IC device process shrinks to below sub-micron dimensions (65nm, 45 nm and beyond), the overall CD error budget becomes more and more challenging. The impact of lithography process parameters other than exposure energy and defocus on final CD results cannot be ignored any more. In this paper we continue the development of the advanced lithography parameters model which we presented last year. This year we achieved to decouple 4 lithography parameters: exposure, focus, PEB temperature and laser bandwidth (or z-blur). To improve the accuracy and precision of the model, new scatterometry marks are designed to reduce the pitch dependent accuracy impact of sidewall angle and photoresist height for scatterometry metrology. The concept of this kind of scatterometry mark design is from T.A. Brunner's paper \"Process Monitor Gating\" [SPIE Vol. 6518, 2007]. With this concept, new scatterometry marks are designed to increase the accuracy of scatterometry measurement without sacrificing the process sensitivity and thus improve the model prediction accuracy.", "As the Integrated Circuit manufacturing market has begun a concerted effort toward the mass production of 45nm node material, the emergence of inaccurate defect sizing and subsequent mis-identification of surface and subsurface defects from Surface Scanning Inspection Systems (SSIS) has become a major impediment for accurate Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Automated Defect Redetection (ADR) and Automated Defect Classification (ADC). Due to the increased manufacturing cost of Silicon Wafers (Silicon on Insulator, Strained Silicon, Strained Silicon on Oxide, Silicon on Silicon Germanium) and the desire from IC manufacturing companies for a continually increasing level of Incoming Quality Assurance (IQA) wafer cleanliness, the cost of IC manufacturing has dramatically risen in recent years. The increased cost of manufacturing for both IC manufacturing and Silicon Wafer manufacturing is driving the requirement for a high throughput Defect Review SEM that is able to independently overcome the defect sizing and defect classification challenges from both the 45nm and 90nm nodes. The benefits of improved SEM ADR and ADC performance must not come at the expense of the SSIS throughput. This paper provides a study of the methods employed in multiple manufacturing lines to provide rapid feedback of yield impacting defects, allowing for improved root cause analysis and improved fab productivity.", "This paper will investigate the potential benefits and limitations of increasing the refractive index of the photoresist for water and high-index immersion based lithography. The primary potential benefits are increased exposure latitude due to restoration of the TM polarization component and improved depth of focus due to a delay in the onset of image-induced top-loss. After first understanding the physical origins of these effects, a series of simulation studies will probe the level of impact they may have for the 32nm and 22nm technology nodes. It is concluded that, although they may provide some process latitude relief, the benefits are minimal for 1.35NA water immersion, especially when weighed against the likely required development effort and cost. The benefits are slightly more compelling for high-index immersion (>1.5 NA), but a high index resist does not appear to be critical, provided the resist is at least as large as the immersion fluid index. A comparable benefit can be achieved with a conventional resist by using polarized illumination (a trend already happening for various reasons) and thinning the resist by ~9% for 1.35NA water immersion and ~15% for 1.55NA high-index immersion. Additionally, increasing the refractive index is typically accompanied by a corresponding increase in absorption. This will be addressed, concluding the limitations of absorption are likely chemical and not optical in nature. High absorption is likely tolerable, provided the chemistry can be engineered to account for exponential intensity decay. The level of difficulty in doing so is addressed.", "ArF immersion lithography using water as a fluid medium enables production of 45 nm features. Extending immersion lithography to 32 nm or below requires increases in the refractive indices of the lens material, the immersion fluid, and the resist material. However, a material with a high refractive index generally also has high absorbance. In attempt to design a resist with high refractive index and low absorbance, we studied several types of sulfur-containing polymers and determined which sulfur groups increase the refractive index without increasing the absorbance at 193 nm. We describe new thioester and sulfone structures that enable high index with low absorbance. This chemistry has been exploited to produce polymers with a refractive index of 1.8 at 193 nm and an absorbance less than 1.4 &mgr;m-1. The compatibility of the sulfur functionality with chemically amplified imaging chemistry was demonstrated by printing at 193 nm.", "Generation-three (Gen-3) immersion lithography offers the promise of enabling the 32nm half-pitch node. For Gen-3 lithography to be successful, however, there must be major breakthroughs in materials development: The hope of obtaining numerical aperture imaging \u2265 1.70 is dependent on a high index lens, fluid, and resist. Assuming that a fluid and a lens will be identified, this paper focuses on a possible path to a high index resist. Simulations have shown that the index of the resist should be \u2265 1.9 with any index higher than 1.9 leading to an increased process latitude. Creation of a high index resist from conventional chemistry has been shown to be unrealistic. The answer may be to introduce a high index, polarizable material into a resist that is inert relative to the polymer behavior, but will this too degrade the performance of the overall system? The specific approach is to add very high index (~2.9) nanoparticles to an existing resist system. These nanoparticles have a low absorbance; consequently the imaging of conventional 193nm resists does not degrade. Further, the nanoparticles are on the order of 3nm in diameter, thus minimizing any impact on line edge roughness (LER).", "At the 32nm node, the most important issue for mass production in immersion lithography is defectivity control. Many methods have been studied to reduce post-exposure immersion defects. Although a topcoat process demonstrates good immersion defect prevention, a topcoat-less resist process is an attractive candidate for immersion lithography due to cost reduction from a simplified process. In this paper we took the innovative approach of chemically designing an internal self-assembling barrier material that creates a thin embedded layer which functions as a topcoat. Data will be presented on this novel self assembly concept, illustrating the control of leaching, contact angle and immersion defects. Several optimized process flows with non-topcoat resists were also studied to decrease the amount of immersion defects. This study was used to verify the capability of a topcoat-less immersion process to achieve the low-defectivity levels required for 32nm node production.", "In this paper, we employ the self-segregating materials approach used in topcoat-free resists for water immersion lithography to extend the performance of topcoat materials for water immersion and to increase the contact angles of organic fluids on topcoat-free resists for high index immersion lithography. By tailoring polymers that segregate to the air and resist interfaces of the topcoat, high contact angle topcoats with relatively low fluorine content are achieved. While graded topcoats may extend the performance and/or reduce the cost of topcoat materials, the large amount of unprotected acidic groups necessary for TMAH development prevent them from achieving the high contact angles and low hysteresis exhibited by topcoat-free resists. Another application of this self-segregating approach is tailoring resist surfaces for high index immersion. Due to the low surface tension and higher viscosities of organic fluids relative to water and their lower contact angles on most surfaces, film pulling cannot be prevented without dramatically reducing wafer scan rates; however, tuning the surface energy of the resist may be important to control stain morphology and facilitate fluid removal from the wafer. By tailoring fluoropolymer additives for high contact angles with second generation organic high index immersion fluids, we show herein that topcoat-free resists can be developed specifically for high index immersion lithography with good contact angles and lithographic imaging performance.", "The need to extend 193nm immersion lithography necessitates the development of a third generation (Gen-3) of high refractive index (RI) fluids that will enable approximately 1.7 numerical aperture (NA) imaging. A multi-pronged approach was taken to develop these materials. One approach investigated the highest-index organic thus far discovered. The second approach used a very high refractive index nanoparticle to make a nanocomposite fluid. This report will describe the chemistry of the best Gen-3 fluid candidates and the systematic approach to their identification and synthesis. Images obtained with the Gen-3 fluid candidates will also be presented for a NA \u2265 1.7.", "In immersion lithography a fluid with a high refractive index is used to enable increases in the numerical aperture (NA) of the imaging system and therefore decrease the minimum feature size that can be patterned. Water has been used in first generation immersion lithography at 193 nm for the 45 nm node. To generate still smaller features, fluids with a higher index than water are needed. Both saturated hydrocarbons and a new class of salts with incorporated alkane groups have been studied. Both of these types of fluids possess the \"adjustable\" absorbance edge behavior needed to provide a fluid with a high index and low absorbance at 193 nm. Since alkanes have physical properties that are difficult to integrate into current fluid handling systems, the aqueous solutions are particularly attractive as more semiconductor-friendly fluids. A full characterization of the optical properties of these fluids will be reported, as well as physical property results and confirmation of the feasibility of 32 nm l/s imaging with 1.5 NA using the salt solutions.", "We report here, new non-acetal containing low bake (PEB < 100\u00b0 C ) resists that are suitable for immersion lithography. These resists are based on novel low activation energy (low-Ea) tertiary ester protecting groups. One major obstacle to imaging in the sub-50 nm regime using chemically amplified resists is the diminished image integrity in the pattern (\"image blur\") due to photo-generated acid diffusion into unexposed regions. Low processing temperatures are predicted to decrease the degree of photoacid diffusion and, in turn, decrease the image blur. Even though many low bake resist compositions have previously been reported, they are all based on acetal/ketal protecting groups. Unfortunately, these materials require a stoichiometric amount of water for the photoacid-catalyzed deprotection reaction to proceed. It is usually assumed that the water for the reaction comes from the environment in the bake station. However, fluctuations in humidity could affect the performance of the resist. Furthermore, acetal/ketal-based resists generally lack storage stability. For these reasons, acetal/ketal-based resists did not receive widespread acceptance in the lithography community. With the introduction of water based immersion lithography, acetal/ketal-based resists are expected to have further performance difficulties. Therefore, we targeted the development of new \"low blur\" resists for 193nm lithography that do not contain acetal/ketal protecting groups.", "It has been found that 193nm immersion lithography technology can achieve smaller patterns without any modification to the technology infrastructure of existing state-of-the-art 193nm dry lithography. This has made 193nm immersion lithography a promising technology for mass production processes. Recently, scanning speed of the exposure stage has been increasing in order to achieve high throughput for mass production. At present, the adoption of a topcoat is one of the promising candidates for this high speed scanning process. On the other hand, the demand for a non-topcoat process is being pursued from a C.O.O. (cost of ownership) point of view but there are still issues being revealed and concerns to be solved. In this report, feasibility of a comprehensive process for high scanning ArF immersion lithography was discussed. As for the topcoat process, a high receding contact angle topcoat, such as TC-A (JSR), is proving to be a good candidate for mass production using high scanning speed immersion lithography. TC-A has a similar defectivity and lithographic performance to TCX041 (JSR). On the other hand, the feasibility of a non-topcoat process was also investigated. CD uniformity, defectivity and lithography performance of AIM5120JN and AIM5570JN (JSR) data indicate that the non-topcoat process can be adopted for mass production process. An immersion cluster comprised of a high volume production immersion exposure tool, S610C (NIKON) having 1.3 NA and CLEAN TRACKTM LITHIUSTM i+ (TEL) track system were used in this study.", "Key issues of resist process design for 32nm node logic device were discussed in this paper. One of them is reflectivity control in higher 1.3NA regime. The spec for the reflectivity control is more and more severe as technology node advances. The target of reflectivity control over existent substrate thickness variation is 0.4%, which was estimated from our dose budget analysis. Then, single BARC process or stacked mask process (SMAP) was selected to each of the critical layers according to the substrate transparency. Another key issue in terms of material process was described in this paper, that is spin-on-carbon (SOC) pattern deformation during substrate etch process. New SOC material without any deformation during etch process was successfully developed for 32nm node stacked mask process (SMAP). 1.3NA immersion lithography and pattern transfer performance using single BARC", "A new negative tone imaging with application of new developer to conventional ArF immersion resist materials is proposed for narrow trench pattern formation, which is effective to the double trench process that is one of the candidates of double patterning process for 32 nm node semiconductor devices. No swelling property was realized in the developing step, in which the dissolution mechanism was discussed. Significantly better LWR and resolution on narrow trench pattern were observed with this negative tone development compared to positive tone development. These results suggest that this negative tone development process is one of the promising candidates for double trench process. Feasibility of double development with negative and positive development process was evaluated as a candidate for pitch frequency doubling process, and quite low k1 number of 0.23 was obtained.", "In this study, we have developed a thermal freezing process to prevent intermixing between 1st patterned positive resist and 2nd positive resist. Based on solvent solubility switch characteristic of polymer after higher temperature bake, a prototype of polymer consisting of methyladmantane mathacrylate, norbornanecarbo lactone mathacrylate and hydroxyl admantane mathacrylate was selected for resist-on-resist double exposure experiment to prevent the intermixing between layers. Photo sensitivity shifting of this prototype resist after post develop bake further facilitates the design by preventing 1st layer resist distortion from 2nd exposure. Lastly, through composition and formulation optimization, 35nm L/S patterns were successfully demonstrated by using a 1.2NA stepper.", "Double patterning based on existing ArF lithography technology is one of the most promising candidates for sub-40nm half-pitch devices. Several variation of double patterning processes have been reported by research groups, including a dual-trench process (litho-etch-litho-etch) and a dual-line process (litho-litho-etch). Between these, the dual-line process is attracting the most attention because it is a simple process that achieves high throughput. However, there is concern that the second lithographic process damages the first litho patterns in the dual-line process. Therefore, new technology must be developed to keep the configuration of first litho patterns during the second lithographic step for this patterning process to be practical. Recently, we have succeeded in forming sub-40nm half-pitch litho patterns by the introduction of a new \"freezing\" step to this process. This step involves covering the first litho pattern with chemical freezing materials to prevent damage by the second litho pattern creating a dual-line process composed of litho-\"freezing\"-litho-etch processes. In this paper, the details of dual-line process including a \"freezing\" step are explained and sub-40nm half-pitch litho patterns by this process are shown.", "Double patterning (DP) lithography appears to be a likely patterning technology for 32 nm node manufacturing. Litho-Litho-Etch DP may offer lower cost-of-ownership than Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch DP methods, but uses novel materials and processes that have not been fully characterized. In this work, one LLE approach (negative resist processed over a positive resist image) is studied; the results are used to develop a rigorous physical model that describes the process behavior. Experimental observations suggest that processing during the second lithographic pass influences the resist features produced by the first pass. A prototype simulator has been developed which can model the behavior of the first resist through the entire double patterning process. The model can also predict the response of the second lithographic pass by accounting for the optical and physical-chemical interactions with the first pass features. After validating the simulation predictions with experimental results, a modeling study investigates the interactions between the two passes as a function of alignment error. The study shows that for materials with similar refractive indices (&Dgr;n \u2a7d 0.1, &Dgr;k \u2248 0) optical effects are small and interactions between the passes are dominated by the boundary conditions, even if the materials are inert to each other.", "A novel molecular resist based on a new amorphous molecule, a truxene derivative, was designed and synthesized. Truxene is characterized as an amorphous solid with a high glass transition temperature (Tg). 70 nm line-and-space (1 : 1) positive pattern was fabricated by the exposure of a low-energy electron beam (5 keV) using the new molecular resist. The new molecular design of resists based on the truxene derivative is promising with regard to development of more efficient molecular resists.", "An ionic and non-ionic single molecule chemically amplified resist have been synthesized, characterized, and imaged under high resolution e-beam. The ionic single molecule resist is based on a tBoc protected triarylsulfonium (TAS) core that generates a free superacid upon exposure. TAS demonstrates a low LER (3&sgr;) of 3.9 nm under 100 keV e-beam exposures with a resolution of 55 nm. Under EUV exposures, it exhibits a LER of 5.2 nm with a sensitivity of 60 mJ/cm2 and 50 nm half-pitch resolution. The non-ionic single molecule resist is based on a sulfonic acid containing molecular glass core that uses a norbornene dicarboximide PAG. It images with a low LER of 3.9 nm and a resolution of 40 nm. The non-ionic resist shows multiple improvements over the ionic system including improved resolution, reduced dark loss, and improved solubility. Both resists successfully demonstrate the feasibility of using a single component molecular resist system with high PAG loading. They also show that single molecule resists provide improved LER compared to conventional PAG blended systems, even for unoptimized systems.", "Surface roughness of molecular and polymer resists were probed with an atomic force microscope (AFM) and analyzed using the power spectrum density (PSD) function. The PSD curve obtained from AFM image of the molecular resist showed a broad profile dependent on the exposure dose and small roughness. The PSD increased more in the low spatial frequency range after the exposure and the correlation length was increased. Meanwhile, the PSD of the polymer resist showed a narrow profile with respect to the dose and large roughness. Overall increase in PSD with respect to the spatial frequency was observed after the exposure.", "The minimum lithographic feature size for microelectronic fabrication continues to shrink, and resist properties are beginning to dominate the achievable resolution. There is a strong need for a high resolution, high sensitivity resist for future nodes that is not met by conventional polymeric resists at this time. Molecular resists, such as fullerene derivatives have the potential for lower LWR and improved resolution, but have typically been insufficiently sensitive to irradiation. Here we present a fullerene based three component chemically amplified resist system with high resolution and sensitivity, and wide process latitude. The sensitivity of this resist is between 5 and 10 \u03bcC/cm2 at 20 keV for various combinations of post application bake and post exposure bake conditions. Using 30 keV electron beam exposure, sparse patterns with 12 nm resolution were demonstrated, at a line dose of 300 pC/cm, whilst dense patterns with half-pitch 20 nm were achieved at 200 pC/cm. The LWR for the densely patterned resist (measured at 20 nm half pitch) is ~ 4.4 nm, whilst for the 12 nm sparse feature the measured LWR is ~ 2.5 nm. The etch durability is comparable with commercial novolac resists", "We developed a chemically amplified molecular resist based on a fullerene derivative and evaluated the lithographic performance using 75 keV electron beam (EB) exposure tool to explore the potential of fullerene derivatives as a positive-type EB resist with high resolution and high sensitivity properties. The etching rate of fullerene derivative is almost similar to that of ZEP and UVIII. Also, the fullerene derivative resist containing 6 wt% acid generator shows a sensitivity of 33 &mgr;C/cm2 when it was exposed to 75 keV electron beam and postbaked at 170 \u00b0C. Although it required a dose of 800 &mgr;C/cm2, a fullerene derivative film yielded line resolution of better than 30 nm. Moreover, the effect of the types of acid generators to the resist performance of fullerene derivatives was investigated. It is very important for a fullerene derivative resist to select appropriate acid generator and process conditions. Fullerene derivative resists are a promising candidate for nanolithography.", "The ability of the semiconductor industry to reduce device dimensions below 45 nm is hindered by limitations in both resist material and processing techniques. High resolution and sensitivity along with low line edge roughness are key requirements of next generation resist materials. In order to meet future demands of the semiconductor industry, new resist design strategies are being considered. In the past few years, we have focused on developing small molecule resists capable of high resolution patterning. Despite their small size, these molecules known as molecular glasses can be designed to demonstrate high glass transition temperature (Tg) comparable to polymeric resists. Several ring and branched architectures with high Tg values that have attained feature resolution as small as 30nm through Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) exposure will be discussed. In addition to potential performance advantages, the small size of these resist molecules also allows solvent free processing techniques to be utilized. Our efforts on physical vapor deposition and supercritical CO2 development of molecular glass resists will also be highlighted. Furthermore, we are also investigating hybrid resist materials by combining short polymeric arms with various molecular glass cores. These innovative architectures are being explored at 193nm wavelength through fundamental structure - property analysis.", "The trade-off between line edge roughness (LER), sensitivity and resolution is the most challenging issue associated with the development of resist processes for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. It has been reported that quenchers (base compounds) affect the sensitivity, the resolution and the extent of LER. However, the details are still unclear. In this study, the effects of quencher diffusion constants in 22 nm pattern formation were investigated using a simulation based on the reaction mechanism of chemically amplified EUV resists. For the suppression of line width expansion due to acid diffusion, mobile quenchers are effective. The quality of latent image is also improved with the increase of diffusion constant. However, the high mobility of quenchers increases the pattern dependence of line width. The same order of diffusion constants for acids and quenchers are preferable at sub-30 nm fabrication.", "A mesoscale model of molecular resists has been created and implemented that allows for the investigation of the effect of material composition and physiochemical properties, such as PAG loading and photoacid diffusion coefficient, on the lithographic performance (i.e. resolution, line edge roughness, and sensitivity or as commonly referred to \"RLS\") of molecular glass photoresists. This model is shown to produce results that are in good agreement with many of the conventional LER scaling arguments. In cases where critical dimension is not held constant, it was found that higher photoacid diffusion improves LER at low acid concentrations, but induces higher LER at high acid concentration as compared to smaller diffusion coefficients. Increased PAG loadings were found to provide comparatively lower LER at the same resolution and sensitivity as lower PAG loadings, or alternatively to provide better sensitivity at the same resolution and LER as lower PAG loadings. Even at ultra-high PAG loadings, CARs were found to exhibit RLS limitations. By normalizing all PAG loadings by the total amount of acid produced, it is shown that LER is controlled primarily by photoacid concentration in the resist at the imaging dose for the case where constant critical dimension is maintained with no use of base quencher in the resist. Thus, the most direct and functional scaling argument for LER under such cases is, which is similar to the more common scaling arguments that state, but as this work shows it is more universal to state that which automatically normalizes for different PAG loadings and photoreaction rate constants across different resist formulations.", "The reduction of semiconductor device dimensions necessitates, amongst others, a reduction of the line-edge roughness (LER) of the lithographically patterned device components. Experimentally, the impact of many process and material parameters on resist LER has been demonstrated. The impact of some parameters on LER has also been described quantitatively. This paper presents a mesoscopic (i.e., discrete and stochastic) modeling approach including all exposure, post-exposure bake (PEB), and development related parameters and their impact on LER. This allows a prediction of the resulting resist profiles including average dimensions as well as LER. The mesoscopic models are applied for simulating the impact of aerial image contrast, acid diffusion length, and quencher base concentration on LER. The results are compared to experimental data. After this validation of the models, they are applied for LER optimization. The optimum combination of acid and base diffusion length is identified for resist formulations with various levels of base concentration. While the impact of acid diffusion length is already known in principle, it is shown in this paper for the first time how the optimum acid diffusion length depends crucially on base di\u00aeusion length and initial base concentration of the resist.", "It is well-known that line edge roughness (LER) of patterned features in chemically amplified (CA) resists is formed in the acid generation stage and expected to be moderated by the acid diffusion and development process. To provide an insight into the limit of LER is essential for the realization of next-generation lithographies such as electron beam or extreme ultraviolet. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulation which reproduces dynamics of chemical intermediates in positive-tone CA resist, we discuss the possibility of low LER (high frequency) after development. It is found that low LER is achievable; however, the process condition is still strict.", "The objective of this work is to understand, from a simulation perspective, how current EUV resist chemistries compare to mature 193nm (ArF) photoresist systems. Accurate resist models for EUV resists may be developed using the same in-house calibration methodology used for ArF resists. Using this methodology, key resist properties, such as optical density, dissolution behavior, and imaging characteristics, are correlated to model parameters that have a significant impact on resist imaging performance. Such resist models, once calibrated, are used to make predictions of key lithographic metrics, such as MEF and process latitude. In this work, model calibration results for ArF and EUV resist systems are compared and the resulting resist models are used to contrast fundamental resist behavior at the ArF and EUV wavelengths.", "Spin-on trilayer materials are increasingly being integrated in high density microfabrication that use high NA ArF lithography due to dwindling photoresist film thicknesses, lower integration cost and reduced complexity compared to analogous CVD stacks. To guide our development in spin-on trilayer materials we have established etch conditions on an ISM etcher for pattern transfer through trilayer hard masks. We report here a range of etch process variables and their impact on after-etch profiles and etch selectivity with AZ trilayer hard mask materials. Trilayer pattern transfer is demonstrated using 1st and 2nd minimum stacks with various pattern types. Etch recipes are then applied to blanket coated wafers to make comparisons between etch selectivities derived from patterned and blanket coated wafers.", "Immersion lithography for the 32nm node and beyond requires advanced methods to control 193 nm radiation reflected at the resist/BARC interface, due to the high incident angles that are verified under high numerical aperture (NA) imaging conditions. Swing curve effects are exacerbated in the high NA regime, especially when highly reflective substrates are used, and lead to critical dimension (CD) control problems. BARC reflectivity control is also particularly critical when underlying surface topography is present in buried layers due to potential reflective notching problems. In this work, a graded spin-on organic BARC was developed to enable appropriate reflectivity control under those conditions. The graded BARC consists of two optically distinct polymers that are completely miscible in the casting solution. Upon film coating and post-apply baking, the two polymers vertically phase-separate to form an optically graded layer. Different characterization techniques have been applied to the study of the distribution of graded BARC components to reveal the internal and surface composition of the optically graded film, which includes Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (VASE) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS). Also, optical constant optimization, substrate compatibility, patterning defectivity and etch feasibility for graded BARC layers are described. Superior 193 nm lithographic performance and reflectivity control of graded BARC beyond 1.20 NA compared to conventional BARCs is also demonstrated.", "This work discusses the development and characterization of Honeywell's middle layer material, UVAS, for trilayer patterning. The UVAS polymer contains high Si content constructed by polymerizing multiple monomers selected to produce a film that meets the requirements as a middle layer for trilayer patterning. Results of ArF photoresist patterning evaluations, plasma and wet etch studies, and photoresist and full stack rework tests will be presented and discussed. ArF photoresist patterning tests show that UVAS exhibits organic BARC like performance with respect to MEEF (Mask Error Enhancement Factor), DOF (Depth of Focus) and EL (Exposure Latitude). Shelf life data shows that UVAS maintains very stable properties even after 6 months storage at room temperature. We will also briefly discuss investigation of amine or nitrogen-based contaminant blocking by the UVAS middle layer.", "New bottom anti-reflective coatings (BARCs) have been developed that can be incorporated into multiple patterning schemes utilizing scanner-track-only processes. The BARCs have modifiable optical properties and can be removed during the resist development step. Several dual patterning schemes were investigated for trench printing. The most promising process produced 110 nm trenches with approximately 1:1 space ratios. The etch characteristics of these BARCs under fluorinated and oxygenated gases were determined.", "Advancing technology nodes in semiconductor manufacturing require more demanding lithographic performance for patterning. The advent of 45 nm development necessitated dual damascene lithography moving from a KrF-based bilayer approach to one that includes an ArF photoresist for higher resolution. There are multiple methods for an ArF dual damascene (via first, trench last) system, including bilayer, trilayer and hard mask approaches. Flash manufacturing demands are sensitive to process cost of ownership, so more complex approaches such as trilayer and hard mask film stacks were not as attractive. One method examined as an ArF dual damascene solution was a so-called \"modified bilayer\" approach, which is a combination of both KrF and ArF resist materials; in particular, this film stack allows for the use of ArF silicon-containing resists along with a variety of anti-reflective and gap fill underlayer materials. The modified bilayer approach afforded many advantages, including chemical compatibility, etch performance and process robustness. The modified bilayer approach represents a culmination of learning that has enabled 45 nm back end of the line (BEOL) dual damascene processing with ArF silicon-containing photoresists.", "The ability to accurately quantify the intrinsic resolution of chemically amplified photoresists is critical for the optimization of resists for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. We have recently reported on two resolution metrics that have been shown to extract resolution numbers consistent with direct observation. In this paper we examine the previously reported contact-hole resolution metric and explore the sensitivity of the metric to potential error sources associated with the experimental side of the resolution extraction process. For EUV exposures at the SEMATECH Berkeley microfield exposure tool, we report a full-process error-bar in extracted resolution of 1.75 nm RMS and verify this result experimentally.", "This report will introduce novel resist materials including specific photo acid generator (PAG) to improve flare issue from the resist standpoint. We have developed a method to control the acid diffusion length from the PAG. It previously reported that acid diffusion length can be altered by the PAG anion size. In this report, we focused on the effect of the Tg of a resist film. The thermal flow rate of a resist film can suggest the approximate resist Tg. Therefore, we measured the thermal flow rate of the resist. And we found out passivity of acid diffusion control by changing PAG species and volume. Moreover, newly designed PAG tested was confirmed to have uniform distribution in the resist film with no PAG clustering at the resist surface at compared to our conventional PAG. This new positive tone resist formulation shows good performance under flare condition. In addition, we focused on the pattern density variation as one of the key parameters for flare value. Low pattern density indicated less flare value. It is considered that negative tone resist to have advantage for isolated line type features. Novel positive and negative tone type resists were compared side-by-side and discussed for its advantages at varying pattern densities.", "A new series of methacrylate substituted benzene sulfonic photoacid generators (PAGs) and a perfluoro alkanesulfonic PAG, bound polymeric resists based on hydroxystyrene (HS) and 2-ethyl-2-adamantyl methacrylate (EA) were prepared and characterized. The acid yield of these PAG bound polymer resists was among the range of 54-81% under deep ultraviolet exposure (254 nm) that agrees well with the electron withdrawing effect of the substituents on the PAG anion for enhancing acid generation efficiency. The intrinsic lithography performance of these polymer-bound PAG resists showed sub-50 nm half-pitch resolution and < 5 nm LER (3\u03c3).", "The main development issue regarding EUV resist has been how to concurrently achieve high sensitivity, high resolution, and low line width roughness (LWR). This paper describes the current status of EUV resist development at Selete with a small field exposure tool (SFET). Selete standard resist 2 (SSR2) can simultaneously resolve 26-nm dense and isolated lines with the SFET. Our top data for resolution with annular illumination shows a 25-nm half-pitch. In evaluating resist performance, resist blur should be estimated separately from exposure tool fluctuations. By considering the aberration, flare, and actual illumination shape, resist blur can be estimated more accurately. We estimate the resist blur for SSR2 to be between 9.5 and 10.4 nm as sigma of the Gaussian convolution. We also present benchmarking results for suppliers' samples. Though sensitivity has been improved somewhat in some resists, further improvement is necessary. Further reduction of LWR is especially needed.", "In order to meet the CDU specifications for the 22, 16 and 11nm technology nodes, EUV systems can be designed that provide sufficiently high aerial image contrast. This can be done by higher NA designs and/or by applying off-axis illumination. The contrast loss from the exposure system can be minimized to less than 10-20% by controlling the lens aberrations, flare and vibrations. However, EUV resist model calibration studies revealed that resist induced contrast loss exceeds 50% thus limiting resolution capability. Experiments were performed to assess state-of-the-art photoresist that showed significant improvements in EUV photoresist contrast while improving sensitivity. Finally, a method to experimentally quantify resist contrast loss was proposed.", "The fundamental understanding of photo acid generator (PAG) leaching and water uptake is important for the design of robust immersion imaging processes; including resist, scanner and track hardware design. Experimental studies show that PAG leaching occurs over a very short time scale (< 10 seconds). Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) analysis also reveals that PAG leaching occurs at the top surface of a resist film. The time scale and depth of PAG leaching is important to understanding the fundamental impact of immersion process steps on imaging performance. Finite element modeling is used to study the diffusion of water into a resist and the diffusion of PAG out of a resist into flowing water. Experimental mass uptake of water in a 150 nm resist film was collected experimentally using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The diffusion coefficient of water in the thin resist is calculated to be 1.5e-11 cm2/s. PAG leaching data was collected from an experimental apparatus that can flow water over a resist coated 200 mm wafer (dynamic WEXA2). The PAG diffusion model shows that the diffusion coefficient transitions from 1.4 e-14 cm2/s in the surface of the film to 1.0 e-16 cm2/s in the bulk of the film. The finite element simulations show an excellent physical correlation to the experimental PAG leaching data. The extraction of resist component diffusion coefficients enables the modeling of component depth profiles in thin resist materials. The component depth profile information is then used to model the impact of resist design and immersion resist processing on 32 nm node imaging performance.", "Chemically amplified resists (CARs) are likely to continue to be the main resist materials platform for next generation lithography using shorter wavelength and higher energy radiation sources, such as extreme ultra-violet (EUV) and electron-beam (EB) lithography, to pattern features at and below the 32 nm technology node. As the cost of generating and manipulating high energy radiation in these techniques increases dramatically, photoacid generators (PAGs) with high sensitivities to these exposure sources are required to efficiently utilize such radiation and maintain high lithography tool throughputs. On the other hand, the high energy radiation used in current and next generation lithography tools can increasingly interact non-selectively with the PAG and polymer resin. Photoacid generation from PAG sensitization pathways involving the photoresist resin (e.g. polymer) becomes another potential route for boosting the photospeed of CARs if the PAG and matrix resin chemistry is selected properly. In this work, a fast, convenient, and material saving method which can measure the acid generation rate and yield under photolysis and radiolysis, as well as determine the efficiency of acid generation through direct PAG excitation and indirect PAG sensitization pathways has been developed. This method utilizes on-wafer ellipsometry to determine the absorption of protonated Courmarin 6 (C6) dye, which is incorporated into the polymer resin as a proton indicator. In this work, triphenylsulfonium triflate PAG is used in two different matrix resins, poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(hydroxystyrene), to illustrate this point that matrix sensitization of the PAG can be important and can be studied using the method developed in this work. This study serves as the starting point for building the structure property relationships needed for intelligent PAG and matrix design to optimize exposure energy utilization in CARs. The validity of this new analytical method is verified by comparing our results in selected PAG-polymer combinations with results obtained from previous studies using different techniques. The potential measurement errors possible when using dye as the proton indicator in a solid-state medium, such as the probability of proton-dye contact and acid generation through dye radiation absorption and sensitization of the PAG, are also analyzed and discussed in this paper.", "It has been recently postulated that sub-22 nm photolithography with polymeric photoresists has reached a materials design barrier due to its large molecular mass and distribution. In this argument, the \"pixel\" size, which is related to the smallest molecular unit, determines the feature fidelity and resolution of the lithographic process. This hypothesis remains unproven, but molecular glass photoresists can provide a test because they can share similar chemical functionality to polymer resists, but with low molecular mass and a monodisperse molecular mass distribution. The low molecular mass leads to the smaller pixel size compared to the radius of gyration of the polymer photoresist. In this work, we compare the deprotection reaction-diffusion kinetics of a common photoacid generator in a polymer and molecular glass resist with similar resist chemistry to elucidate effects of molecular architecture on photoresist performance. We determine the mechanism of reaction, photoacid trapping behavior, and diffusivity by measuring and comparing the reaction kinetics parameters as a function of temperature and exposure dose. These results permit an analysis of the latent image formation which is a crucial factor in resolution and line-edge roughness. Further, knowledge of the reaction-diffusion parameters of each type of resist provides a quantitative approach to predict line-space features, crucial for design for resolution-enhancement features.", "Lactones are almost ubiquitously employed in 193 nm resists to increase the polarity of hydrophobic alicyclic polymers. What else do lactones do in 193 nm resists? We studied the behavior of methacrylate (MA) resists consisting of different protecting groups, hexafluoroalcohols, and norbornane lactone methacrylate (NLM, 2-oxo-3-oxatricyclo[4.2.1.04,8]nonan-5-yl methacrylate). When the protecting group is large [ethylcyclooctyl (ECO) and methyladamantyl (MAd)], thinning of the resist film that occurs in highly exposed areas upon postexposure bake (PEB) is significantly smaller than what is expected from the polymer composition. When the concentration of isopropylhexafluoroalcohol methacrylate (iPrHFAMA) is increased in the ECOMA-NLM polymer, the thinning increases and reaches 100% of theory and the ECOMA-norbornenehexafluoroalcohol methacrylate (NBHFAMA) resist loses quantitative thickness in highly-exposed areas upon PEB at 90 \u00b0C. This indicates that small lactones which are more basic than esters can trap deprotection fragments especially when the protecting group is large. Such entrapment was detected by IR spectroscopy and also observed at temperatures as high as 200 \u00b0C in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Incorporation of lactone appears to decrease the bake temperature sensitivity and the sensitivity of the resist perhaps due to trapping of photochemically generated acids by basic lactone. The lactone ring can be hydrolyzed during aqueous base development but does not seem to affect the dissolution rate, indicating that hydrolysis occurs in aqueous base solution after dissolution. Poly(methacrylic acid-NLM) dissolves as fast as poly(methacrylic acid) in 0.26 N tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) aqueous solution. While exposed P(ECOMA47-NLM53) resist dissolves in 0.26 N developer at about the same rate as authentically prepared poly(methacrylic acid47-NLM53), the dissolution rate of highly-exposed P(MAdMA44-NLM56) resist is much slower, indicating that the deprotection fragment from the former does not interfere with the development but that from the latter does. When the NLM concentration is increased to 75 %, highly exposed P(ECOMA-NLM) resist dissolves slowly at ca. 600 A/sec and swells significantly, indicating that NLM can be a dissolution inhibitor and swelling enhancer when its concentration is high. Low activation energy protecting groups such as ethylcyclooctyl allows imaging at temperatures as low as 60 \u00b0C. However, the temperature dependence of the dose to clear is very large and the chemical contrast is quite small in the low temperature range. Thus, for PEB temperature stability and contrast enhancement, baking 20-30 \u00b0C above the lowest practical temperature is recommended.", "We have measured the acid generation efficiency with EUV exposure of a PAG in different polymer matrixes representing the main classes of resist polymers as well as some previously described fluoropolymers for lithographic applications. The polymer matrix was found to have a significant effect on the acid generation efficiency of the PAG studied. A linear relationship exists between the absorbance of the resist and the acid generation efficiency. A second inverse relationship exists between Dill C and aromatic content of the resist polymer. It was shown that polymer sensitization is important for acid generation with EUV exposure and the Dill C parameter can be increased by up to five times with highly absorbing non-aromatic polymers, such as non-aromatic fluoropolymers, over an ESCAP polymer. The increase in the Dill C value will lead to an up to five fold increase in resist sensitivity. It is our expectation that these insights into the nature of polymer matrix effects on acid generation could lead to increased sensitivity for EUV resists.", "In chemically amplified resists, amines (base compounds) play important roles such as the\u3000control of acid diffusion, the sharpening of image slope and the improvement of environmental resistivity of resist materials. However, the details in the reactions between amines and protons in solid films are still unknown. In this research, we have investigated the neutralization of acids by amines in poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS). Proton dynamics in the presence of amines in PHS films is discussed.", "To meet the challenges for resist materials raised by high resolution lithography technologies, tailor-made photoacid generators (PAGs) with controlled acid diffusion and improved miscibility with polymers are very important. We have developed new ionic PAGs containing functionalized semifluorinated sulfonates. These PAGs have excellent solubility in polymer matrices and common organic solvents, high thermal stability, high acid strength and low volatility of the generated acids, and make them attractive PAGs for high resolution lithography. In this contribution, the preparation and characterization of several new ionic PAGs, the influence of the host matrix on PAG properties, and a comparison of their lithographic performance are presented. Specifically their lithographic performance at EUV wavelength is discussed.", "Acid diffusion during the post-exposure bake of chemically amplified resists (CARs) is a major contributing factor to line width roughness (LWR) and resolution limits at the 32 nm node and beyond. To overcome these limitations, non-CAR materials are becoming more attractive because acid diffusion is eliminated. We have therefore focused our effort on the synthesis of copolymers that have both a diacyldiazo side chain unit as well as a hexafluoroalcohol unit. This copolymer shows better contrast than that of copolymers containing lactone units due to their inhibition behavior. Furthermore, polymer blends containing hexafluoroalcohol groups show good 100 nm line and space patterning property for 193 nm lithography. This paper describes the design, synthesis, and characterization of these non-CARs, and thier improvement to photolithography.", "Resolution and accuracy needs for the most advanced nodes, as well as fab capacities management are requirements that encourage the use of ArF resists for post-gate implant levels. In this paper, we investigate several key integration criteria that an ArF resist needs to fulfill to be used for implant applications. Outgassing level is followed during the first seconds of the implantation step and is systematically found under the chamber pressure limit. As well, stopping power efficiency is evaluated. SIMS analysis and simulation tests with SRIM software are performed to define the minimum resist thickness that prevents ions to penetrate the layers underneath. Data indicate that both experimental and simulation tests are in good agreement and that at low energies the stopping layer thickness is found to be in the order or lower than 80 nm. Finally, the impact of implantation step on patterned wafers is carried out. Features of interest are dense and isolated lines with a nominal CD of 130 nm. We control the CD and profile with a standard CD SEM and a CD AFM in order to get access to additional information such as height of the feature, top rounding and the CD through height. Results underline that our patterned resist doesn't show significant degradation under our implant conditions.", "Line width roughness (LWR) reduction is a critical issue for low k1 ArF immersion lithography. Various approaches such as materials, exposure technology and the track process have been performed for LWR reduction during lithography process. It was reported that the post-development bake process had good performance for LWR reduction (1). However, the post-development bake process induced large CD change owing to the degradation of large isolated resist pattern. Therefore post-development process with small iso-dense bias is required in low k1 ArF immersion lithography. The resist smoothing process is one of the candidates for LWR reduction with small iso-dense bias. This method whereby the resist pattern surface is partially melted in organic-solvent atmosphere was shown to have a significant LWR reduction effect on resist patterns. This paper reports on the application of the resist smoothing process to the ArF immersion resist pattern after development. It was found that the resist smoothing process was effective to reduce LWR for ArF immersion resist. As a result of LWR trace from after development to after the hard mask etching process, the effect of LWR reduction with the resist smoothing process continued after the hard mask etching process. Furthermore CD change of large isolated patterns with the smoothing process was smaller than in the case of post-development bake process. We confirmed that the resist smoothing process is an effective method for decreasing LWR in ArF immersion lithography.", "The aim of the paper is the development of an all-dry photolithographic process in which the film preparation step as well as the development step is performed without the use of solvent. To implement an all-dry photoresist system we focused on coumarin derivatives, as this class can be photodimerized in the solid state and features sufficient high thermal stability. The dimerized product exhibits sufficiently different physical properties. The monomer can be evaporated at elevated temperatures whereas the dimerized product remains non-volatile under these conditions. With a tailored glass forming coumarin derivative we demonstrated the capability to develop clear patterns. A combinatorial approach, i.e. producing a compositional library in combination with the variation of exposure dose was utilized to efficiently optimize the all-dry photoresist system.", "A water developable, non-chemically amplified, negative tone single molecule resist (tris(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)sulfonium tosylate, otherwise referred to as TAS-tBoc-Ts) was synthesized, characterized, and imaged using high resolution electron beam lithography. The solubility switching in the negative tone imaging mode in this material, which occurs for no or low temperature post-exposure bakes, occurs through photolytic conversion of some fraction of the ionic PAG molecules into non-ionic photoproducts which act as strong dissolution inhibitors to the remaining unreacted molecules in the film. It was also shown that this resist system can dmonstrate positive tone chemically amplified imaging behavior under different processing conditions, i.e. when using higher temperature post-exposure bakes above 100 \u00b0C . Pure water was found to be the preferential developer as compared to conventional aqueous alkaline TMAH developers in this particular system for negative tone imaging. Under 100 keV e-beam imaging and water development, a sensitivity of 66 &mgr;C/cm2 and contrast of 7.9 was obtained. TAS-tBoc-Ts obtained 40 nm 1:2 line-space resolutions with a low LER of 5.3 nm using electron beam imaging with no apparent swelling or residue problems. This new material and its negative tone imaging process provide a possible path forward for designing non-chemically amplified resists that may obtain higher resolutions than current chemically amplified resists at competitive sensitivities.", "The adamantane-based molecular glass resist were studied its functional capability for lithography process in this work. GR-5 represented adamantane-based molecular glass resist were described as compared with the conventional polymer for 193 nm lithography. Low molecular weight which is one of the features of the molecular glass resist are expected to reduce the line width roughness (LWR) and the line edge roughness (LER). We evaluated the surface roughness (Ra; arithmetic mean departures of roughness profile from the mean line) by using the atomic force microscopy (AFM) instead. GR-5 has actually lower Ra value of 0.345 nm after the exposure and the development process. As the result of the confirmation of the GR-5's performance between the refractive index (n) and transparency (T), although n value stood on over 1.8, T value was less than 30% at 193 nm wave length. It is not likely to solve the higher refractive index and the higher transparency simultaneously. Further the scope of the adamantane-based molecular glass resist to apply for the EUV lithograph was found.", "Molecular glass resists are low molecular-weight organic photoresist materials that readily form stable amorphous glasses above room temperature. They can lead to high resolution patterns. New families of ester acetal molecular glass materials have been created by the reaction between monocarboxylic acid and divinyl ethers. These organic materials are monodisperse and amorphous. They can be dissolved in common solvents and possess high thermal stability. The ester acetal compounds can be quickly decomposed at the presence of strong acid generated by photoacid generator (PAG) at room temperature or higher temperature and become easily soluble in dilute aqueous base. They can form positive photoresists together with PAG. The lithographic performance of the resist materials is being evaluated.", "The idea of using small molecules instead of polymers for next generation lithography may enable improved resolution and line edge roughness (LER). Rather than using polymeric materials we are focusing on a new class of materials known as molecular glasses (MGs). These are low molecular weight organic materials that demonstrate high glass transition temperatures despite their modest size. Unlike polymeric resists, these molecules have the added advantages of distinct size and uniformity. We have synthesized a series of molecular resists containing rigid aromatic backbones and phenolic moieties suited for electron beam and Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography as both positive tone and negative tone photoresists. An increase in glass transition temperature is observed with increasing size and rigidity. Glass transition temperatures (Tgs) between 80-130\u00b0C have been observed for t- BOC protected positive tone resists with molecular weights within the range of 800-1200g/mol. MGs with branched, dense structures are explored to design high Tg resist systems with improved sensitivity and contrast. The effects of protection ratio, high and low activation protecting groups, post exposure bake conditions, etch resistance and outgassing have been tested using selected phenolic MG resists. These new resist architectures are synthesized and evaluated to attain sub 30nm feature sizes required of candidates for next generation lithography.", "We have examined four molecular glasses (MGs) which are candidates for EUV photoresist formulations. These derivatized glasses, and their unprotected precursors, were investigated by both proton and 13C solid state NMR techniques in the bulk state as pure materials and as mixtures with 5 or 10 % by mass of the photoacid generator (PAG), triphenyl sulfonium perfluorobutanesulfonate. The 13C techniques gave information about crystallinity, purity, and the presence of the PAG. This paper characterizes the intimacy of mixing of the PAG and the MGs using proton spin diffusion methods. Phase separation of the PAG into PAG-rich larger domains was never seen; the PAG was always finely distributed. A maximum diameter for any PAG clustered into spherical domains was estimated to be 3.8 nm, which is too small to reflect thermodynamic incompatibility as the driving force during relatively slow removal of solvent. Hence, PAG blended samples are deduced to be thermodynamically compatible, with differential solubility in the preparation solvent the most likely candidate for producing the significant inhomogeneities in PAG concentration observed in a few samples. For one of the unprotected crystalline calix[4]resorcinarenes precursor materials, the solvent, N-methyl 2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) was used. The resulting solid was crystalline with a segregation of isomers, one of which formed a solid adduct with a 1:1 molecular ratio with NMP. Qualitatively, the strong NMP affinity for the calix[4]resorcinarenes is also evident in a) the immobility of the NMP, b) the fact that the 14N quadrupolar interaction changes when NMP goes from the crystalline, unprotected host to a glassy, protected host, and c) that NMP tends to remain as a significant residue. Only the underivatized materials display crystallinity implying that the mixing of the PAG with any derivatized MG is not restricted by crystallization, at least not before the post-exposure bake step. As a final note, very strong hydrogen bonds exist in three underivatized materials which is reduced or eliminated with partial protection with t-BOC.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography at a wavelength of 13.5 nm has been prepared for next generation lithography for several years. Of primary concern in EUV lithography is line edge roughness as well as high sensitivity. In recent years, various types of resist, such as protected PHS resin resist and molecular resist, have been investigated. In order to reduce LER, we have studied novel molecular resists which are promising alternative to polymeric photoresists for use as imaging materials with improved resolution and line edge roughness. The work reported in this paper has focused on the development of a new class of chemically amplified molecular resists that are composed of a single molecule which contains all of the different functionalities desired in a chemically amplified resists. For the purpose of improvement of the resist performance, we have designed the resist material of a protected polyphenol derivative (protected Compound A). PAG moiety is bonded to Compound A to achieve uniform PAG density and to control the acid diffusion length in a resist film. We analyzed uniformity of PAG density in a resist film by using gradient shaving preparation and TOF-SIMS analysis. From the TOF-SIMS spectra, the ions intensities of the PAG moiety are almost constant from the surface to the bottom of the film. Therefore, we can conclude that PAG is distributed homogeneously. Under e-beam exposure, a 100nm thick film of the PAG bonded molecular resist resolved lines down to 100nm. We also discussed the new design for molecular resists, their synthesis and lithographic performance.", "Successful fluids for use in 3rd generation 193 nm immersion lithography must have refractive indices of \u2265 1.80 at 193 nm, \u2264 0.15/cm absorbance at 193 nm, and be photochemically inert to 193 nm radiation. Various classes of organic compounds were prepared and evaluated for use as 3rd generation 193 nm immersion fluids. Functional groups that were evaluated included: sulfones, sulfoxides, sulfonic acids, ammonium sulfonate salts, alkanes, alkyl chlorides, alkynes, and nitriles. Several compounds were synthesized including three sulfone and three sulfonic acid compounds. Other commercially available compounds of interest underwent extensive purification prior to evaluation. Although this work did not lead to any specific solutions to the challenge of identifying 3rd generation 193 nm immersion fluids, it can be concluded that high density hydrocarbons based on cubane may have the best chance of meeting these goals.", "The objective of to develop high refractive index (HRI) chemical amplified resists (CAR), which are composed of HRI photoacid generator (PAG) bound polymer resists, and incorporate HRI nanoparticles into the polymer matrix. Therefore, this new series of nanocomposite resists should be effective for 193 nm immersion lithography with high RI, to obtain feature sizes down to 32 nm or lower.", "On the device manufacturing, the film edge control around the wafer edge has been critical at the point of edge control of deposited film. So far, the film edge control is operated by the wafer edge exposure system and/or the edge beam remover. The immersion lithography which is applied to the device generation below 65 nm node requires more additional and severe items for film edge control. These typical requirements are position control of coating film and wafer bevel cleanness. For examples, top coat film is widely applied to the immersion lithography. But this topcoat film is easily peeled off, if top coat film edge should be directly located on the wafer substrate like Si wafer. Thus, the edge position of topcoat film must be controlled very carefully. And the particle or residues on the wafer bevel is thought to be one of the causes to generate immersion defect. Wafer bevel must be clean in order to reduce the immersion defect. Then we have developed novel application technology in order to solve these kinds of immersion defectivities. This new application technology is based on rinse solution technology and new hardware concept. This new application technology can control the edge position of coating film with high accuracy and can reduce the particle and residues. We show the edge position accuracy using our application technology and furthermore, the stability of edge position accuracy in case of multi-layered resist process. We also show the cleanness of the wafer bevel area at the same time. And we can achieve the immersion process with wide process latitude with innovative application technology.", "In this study, the top coating (TC) resist and new top coating free (TCF) resist at the condition of immersion patterning process have been evaluated and compared in the respect of leaching rate, process margins and immersion related defects. The 55nm of dense L/S patterns are defined by using immersion process. The leaching rates of TCF resist are investigated for the different conditions of baking temperatures and leaching times. Their measurements have been done for the cation and anion dissociated from PAG under the conditions of unexposed and exposed areas. The cation leaching rate of new TCF resist is 1.4 \u00d7 E-13 mol/cm2.sec at the unexposed area. It is lower than the spec suggested by ASML. From the leaching data, it is confirmed that the TCF resist can apply for the patterning without top coating material. The process margins of TCF resist are slightly wider than those of TC resist in the respect of depth of focus and energy latitude. And the top loss of TC resist and TCF resist are 20nm and 8nm, respectively after development process. The immersion related defects are also investigated for these resists. The defect map of TCF resist shows much fewer defects than those of TC resist. The immersion related defect of TCF resist is not founded among the patterns and the number of micro-bridge defect is fewer than 5. The defect level of TCF resist is more stabilized by optimizations of chemical structure of resist and process. From the experimental results, it is confirmed that the TCF resist is available to apply for device production of sub-55nm technology. Especially, the application of TCF resist can reduce the process step of top coating and also make the improvement of through-put with cost of ownership in process. Therefore, the TCF resist should be progressively studied and applied for device production in the respect of improvement of device property and process simplification.", "In immersion lithography, the impact of water on resist performance and the possibility of damage to the lens by the components eluted from the resist material are seriously concern. And much work has shown that controlling the water-resist interface is critical to enabling high scan rates. Many topcoat materials have been developed to control the aforementioned interfacial properties. Developable topcoats have been particularly investigated as suitable candidates for its applicability to the resist developing process. Achieving the balance between the low surface energy required for higher receding contact angle and the base solubility for topcoat removal is challenging. We have already reported FUGU polymer which have partially fluorinated monocyclic structure and hexafluoroalcohol(HFA) group and showed that its developer solubility was excellent but hydrophobicity was insufficient for high scan rate. We have also reported that co-polymers of FUGU and highly fluorinated monomers which have perfluorinated cyclic structure had sufficient hydrophobicity but lower developer solubility. We have found that it was difficult to use these copolymers in themselves as topcoat. But by blending of moderate amount of these copolymers into FUGU polymer, we have finally obtained highly hydrophobic developer-soluble topcoat. Hydrophobicity can be controlled by blending ratio. Furthermore we have newly successfully synthesized a series of fluoropolymers, FIT polymer partially fluorinated monocyclic structure and having carboxylic acid group as developer-soluble unit. When FIT polymer as well as FUGU polymer, was blended to highly hydrophobic copolymer, the blended polymer also showed higher hydrophobicity keeping sufficient developer solubility.", "In this study, we focus on the controllability of a wafer bevel from adhesion and hydrophobicity viewpoints in order to solve the problems of film peeling and microdroplet formation around wafer bevels, which result in pattern defects. Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) treatment is a common solution to these problems. We examine a novel wafer bevel treatment utilizing silane coupling agents (SCAs) for obtaining high adhesion and hydrophobicity. SCAs comprise trimethoxysilanol and organic functional groups. These groups react with inorganic substrates and films just over the surface subjected to a novel chemical treatment (NCT), respectively. Several organic functional groups both with and without fluorine are examined. The hydrophobicity is estimated from the static and receding contact angles of water. The adhesion strength is measured from the stress required for pulling the topcoat film away from the substrate subjected to the NCT. The coating performance of chemicals on the surface by the NCT and the aging stability of the formulated solution of the SCAs are examined for optimizing the composition of the NCT solution. Further, we verify the film peeling behavior and water leakage in wafers having a topcoat, ArF resist, and bottom antireflective coating (BARC) using a quasi-immersion exposure stage.", "In order to prepare for the next generation technology manufacturing, ASML and TEL are investigating the process manufacturability performance of the CLEAN TRACKTM LITHIUS ProTM-i/ TWINSCANTM XT:1900Gi lithocluster at the 45nm node. Previous work from this collaboration showed the feasibility of 45nm processing using the LITHIUSTM i+/TWINSCAN XT:1700i. 1 In this work, process performance with regards to critical dimension uniformity and defectivity are investigated to determine the robustness for manufacturing of the litho cluster. Specifically, at the spinner and PEB plate configuration necessary for the high volume manufacturing requirement of 180 wafers per hour, process data is evaluated to confirm the multi-module flows can achieve the required process performance. Additionally, an improvement in the edge cut strategy necessary to maximize the usable wafer surface without negative impact to defectivity is investigated.", "The formation mechanism of various 193nm immersion-related defects is investigated. The experimental results are reviewed and compared to the simulation results, which enables us to form a clear picture of how the immersion defects are generated. Based on the understanding of defects mechanisms, a series of the defect reduction measures is proposed for the 193nm immersion process.", "Immersion lithography is being actively developed toward mass production for 55nm node devices and beyond. Advances are being made toward large depths of focus and higher resolution, but the underlying problem of machine and material cost increases remains. Our work over the past few years has shown that the main-chain fluorinated base resins realized by the co-polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and norbornene derivatives offer high dissolution rates and moderate surface properties. However, it is difficult to synthesis these materials and their high cost is disadvantageous. Recently, we switched our attention to &agr;-fluoroacrylate and have synthesized various monomers and polymers for immersion lithography. &agr;-fluoroacrylate has a polymerization rate faster than acrylate and methacrylate, and its polymers are superior to theirs. In this paper, we will report these synthesis methods and immersion specific properties such as the dissolution rate in standard alkaline solution and water contact angle. Furthermore, we consider with relationship between dissolution rate and polymer structure by infrared method.", "For this paper, we have performed a fundamental characterization of various resists and topcoats supplied by different vendors. The resists and topcoats were selected based on the inherent properties of these chemicals (elemental composition, contact angle, etc.). The goal of this study is to better understand the resist and topcoat interaction under various process conditions. We have characterized these materials using a number of analytical techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We have also provided data on the effect of the constitution of the resist and topcoat materials on the resist profile, under both dry and immersion exposure.", "We have developed a unique resist stabilization process for double patterning that uses 172 nm UV curing to 'freeze' a first photoresist pattern prior to application and patterning of a second photoresist film. 172 nm cure offers many potential advantages over other resist stabilization processes, including improved pattern fidelity vs. other cure processes and track-based implementation scenarios that are relatively simple, compact, and inexpensive. Assessment of 172 nm double imaging process requirements and limitations indicates that pattern distortions in the 'frozen' first photoresist may arise during all 2nd patterning steps, including coating, exposure, and development. Careful optimization to maximize overall pattern fidelity is needed. Process optimization using a conventional 193 nm photoresist suggests that pattern freeze approaches based on resist cure are best suited to extremely regular structures due to line-end and other resist distortions. Nevertheless, the method allows cross-grid contact printing at lithographic k1 = 0.385.", "With regard to the resist stacking process, it was proposed that the implantation of ions whose acceleration voltage was below 50 kV could make the lower-layer resist insoluble for the upper-layer resist patterning process. But the lower-layer resist pattern was observed to be peeled off in a pattern. In another type of the pattern whose lower-layer pattern was fastened by the upper-layer pattern, there were caves in the bottom of the lower-layer resist pattern. From the calculation of the projected range of the ions, it was found that the ions cannot reach the bottom of the lower-layer resist pattern, so that the bottom of the lower-layer resist was not hardened. The peeling-off was due to the dissolution of the bottom in the lower-layer resist during the development of the upper-layer resist pattern. When the acceleration voltage of the implanted ions is set so that the projected range of the ions is larger than the resist thickness, the lower-layer resist can be made effectively insoluble for the upper-layer resist patterning process. The ion implanted pattern can be used as the etching mask. Moreover, the ions can be prevented from penetrating the film to be etched by adjusting the acceleration voltage.", "Pattern reduction has created a great deal of interest in finding effective methods to reduce the feature sizes of microelectronic and data-storage devices. These methods are divided between top-down approach such as photolithography and bottom-up approach such as self-assembly. For below 32 nm node technology, top-down approach has obstacles such as diffraction-limited resolution and high cost of ownership. Bottom-up approach has obstacles such as the insufficient support of processes and mass production. As one of solutions, double patterning technology (DPT) has been researched. In this paper, DPT is analytically shown more dense patterns then single or double exposures. For the reduction of the DPT complexity, a mask design method, which is the inverse lithography technology (ILT) based on pixels and the lithography model, is described as an integrated computational lithography platform to handle the DPT. The ILT can use the decomposition of design and optical proximity correction for below 32 nm half pitch pattern generation. A simple example is performed for its verification.", "This paper describes our initial investigation into building a greater understanding of the complex mechanism occurring during extreme ultraviolet (EUV) exposure of resist materials. In particular, we are focusing on the number and energy of photoelectrons generated and available for reaction with photoacid generators (PAGs). We propose that this approach will best enable the industry to develop resists capable of meeting resolution, line width roughness (LWR), and sensitivity requirements.", "A new methodology that allows monitoring the deprotection kinetic of UV sensitive thin resist films was recently developed at LTM. This tool measures by ellipsometry changes in optical properties of thin resist films heated at a PEB temperature and exposed to UV. This article presents results of the deprotection kinetic of model resist supplied by Rohm and Haas. Films thicknesses range from 58nm to 150nm. Two thermal protocols were used to check an impact of the film thickness on the deprotection kinetic. The first one is a thermal ramp were temperature increases at a given rate. Prior to this ramp the sample was exposed to UV for 60s with the help of a broadband Xe lamp. This protocol allows detecting the temperature that initiates the deprotection reaction into the film. The second test consists in heating the samples at a fixed temperature for a given time and to expose to UV the film at this temperature. This studies supplies information on the deprotection kinetic occurring in the film at this temperature. The work we did on 193 nm resist films clearly shows that this technique can monitor both the thermal initiation of the deprotection and the real time measurement of the compaction kinetic of the film during the PEB. The initial film thickness impact on the deprotection kinetic is presented in this paper to check whether lithography processes should be adapted to the film thickness.", "Critical dimension uniformity (CDU) has both across field and across wafer components. CD error generated by across wafer etching non-uniformity and other process variations can have a significant impact on CDU. To correct these across wafer variations, compensation by exposure dose and/or PEB temperature, have been proposed. These compensation strategies often focus on a specific structure without evaluating how process compensation impacts the CDU of all structures to be printed in a given design. In a previous study, the authors evaluated the relative merits of across wafer dose and PEB temperature compensation on the process induced CD bias and CDU. For the process studied, both metrics demonstrated that using PEB temperature to control across wafer CD variation was preferable to using dose compensation. The previous study was limited to a single resist and variations to track and scanner processing were kept to a minimum. Further examination of additional resist materials has indicated that significant variation in dose and PEB temperature induced CD biases exist from material to material. It is the goal of this work to understand how resist design, as well as track and scanner processing, impact process induced bias (PIB). This is accomplished by analyzing full resist models for a range of resists that exhibit different dose and PEB temperature PIB behavior. From these models, the primary resist design contributors to PIB are isolated. A sensitivity analysis of the primary resist design as well as track and scanner processing effects will also be simulated and presented.", "Strong off-axis illumination at contact hole level is used to improve the process latitude and the imaging contrast. As consequence the circularity of the contact can be affected and its shape can become elliptical. Aim of this work is to investigate the impact of film thickness and resist formulation on the lithographic performances of contact holes when printed by a dipole illumination. Using a commercially available ArF photoresist as a baseline, after the process window, the main focus was on the circularity of the contact hole, which is defined as the CD-ratio between Y- and X-directions as measured by top-down CD-SEM. We observed that a different resist thickness can modify the circularity of the contact hole. Besides, when using a resist formulation with changed absorbing photo acid generator (PAG) we observed a similar effect. We looked further into the impact of the anion size of the PAG and a PAG which combines both different absorbances with different anion size. We continued this study with an investigation of the effects of base quencher loading level, polymer type and solvent.", "Poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS) has been used in KrF excimer laser (248 nm) lithography as a backbone polymer, and is also a promising material for EUV or electron beam lithography. Analysis of the intermediate species is important for the control of reactions in resist materials. Since the size of integrated circuits fabricated for mass production will decrease below 30 nm and the size error must also be decreased to the molecular level, the elucidation of proton dynamics at the molecular level is also important for reducing the deviation of the resist pattern size. In this study, the dynamics of PHS radical cations were studied, because PHS radical cation is main source of proton. The transient absorption of PHS was observed in the near-infrared region (NIR) in p-dioxane solutions by pulse radiolysis. The intramolecular PHS dimer radical cation (M2+.) were observed, whereas p-cresol shows no distinct CR band. Although the radical cations of phenol derivatives are known to be easily deprotonated, it was found that M2+. formation prevents deprotonation by its charge resonance stabilization.", "The trade-off between resolution, sensitivity, and line edge roughness (LER) is the most serious problem for the development of sub-30 nm resists based on chemical amplification. Because of this trade-off, the increase in acid generation efficiency is essentially required for high resolution patterning with high sensitivity and low LER. Under such circumstances, the absorption coefficient and the acid generation efficiency are elemental key factors for the design of chemically amplified extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resist because the acid distribution in resist films is primarily determined by these two factors. In this study, we investigated the dependence of acid generation efficiency on the molecular structure and concentration of acid generators in chemically amplified EUV resists. The acid generation efficiency (the number of acid molecules generated by a single EUV photon) was obtained within the acid generator concentration range of 2-30 wt % for several kinds of ionic and nonionic acid generators.", "Current extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresist materials do not yet meet performance requirements on exposure-dose sensitivity, line-width roughness, and resolution. In order to quantify how these trade-offs are related to the materials properties of the resist and processing conditions, advanced measurements and fundamental studies are required that consider EUV-resist specific problems. In this paper, we focus on the correlations between the latent image and developed image in EUV exposed line/space features. The latent images of isolated lines produced by EUV lithography are characterized by atomic force microscopy through the change in topology caused by change in film thickness that occurs upon deprotection. The resulting latent-image deprotection gradient (DGL), based on line cross-sections, and latent-image line-width roughness (LWRL) provide metrics and insight into ways to optimize the lithographic process. The results from a model poly(hydroxystyrene-co-tert-butylacrylate) resist and a model calix[4]resorcinarene molecular glass type resist show the general applicability of the metric before development.", "Against the backdrop of remarkable strides in recent EUVL research, EUV chemically amplified resists were discussed as a critical issue in last year's International EUVL Symposium. Important concerns involving resists include improvements in resolution and sensitivity and reductions in outgassing and roughness. One important factor in improving resolution and sensitivity is understanding the behavior of the de-protection reaction of a photoresist during EUV exposures. We examined a system to analyze de-protection reactions in an ultra-thin-film process suitable for the EUV resist process.", "Reversible Addition Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) technology has been developed for use in producing high yield low polydispersity (PD) polymers for many applications. RAFT technology is being used to produce low PD polymers and to allow control of the polymer architecture. A variety of polymers are being synthesized for use in advanced photoresists using this technique. By varying the RAFT reagent used we can modulate the system reactivity of the RAFT reagent and optimize it for use in acrylate or methacrylate monomer systems (193 and 193i photoresist polymers) or for use in styrenic monomer systems (248 nm photoresist polymers) to achieve PD as low as 1.05. RAFT polymerization technology also allows us to produce block copolymers using a wide variety of monomers. These block copolymers have been shown to be useful in self assembly polymer applications to produce unique and very small feature sizes. The mutual compatibilities of all the components within a single layer 193 photoresist are very important in order to achieve low LWR and low defect count. The advent of immersion imaging demands an additional element of protection at the solid/liquid interface. We have used RAFT technology to produce block copolymers comprising a random \"resist\" block with composition and size based on conventional dry photoresist materials, and a \"low surface energy\" block for use in 193i lithography. The relative block lengths and compositions may be varied to tune solution behavior, surface energy, contact angles, and solubility in developer. The use of this technique will be explored to produce polymers used in hydrophobic single layer resists as well as additives compatible with the main photoresist polymer.", "Chemically amplified resists (CAR) have successfully facilitated the development of deep ultra-violet (DUV) and 193 nm lithography techniques for more than two decades due to their acid-catalyzed deprotection scheme that enhances their photospeed. This acid-catalyzed mechanism provides a method for amplifying the initial chemical reactions caused by interaction of radiation with the resist film, thus making each interaction event between radiation and resist more productive. However, when switching from low energy photolysis to high energy radiolysis, changes in the manner in which the radiation interacts with the resist material can alter the acid generation efficiency and mechanism of PAG excitation. In high energy radiation cases where the radiation energy exceeds the ionization potential of the PAG and the polymer resin, the radiation absorption in the resist film becomes non-selective. The ratio of PAG excited by direct excitation as compared to polymer or matrix sensitization pathways can shift heavily in favor of matrix sensitization in such high energy exposure cases. Such sensitization pathways may become a potential method for enhancing resist sensitivity under high energy radiation through careful selection of matrix and PAG materials. A better understanding and study the efficiency of acid generation through direct and indirect PAG excitation pathways and the effect of PAG and matrix structure on these pathways would be extremely valuable for the design of future high sensitivity resist materials. In this work, the acid generation of typical ionic (onium salt) and non-ionic PAGs under DUV (248 nm) and electron-beam exposure in polymer film have been studied. The effect of PAG type and structure on its acid generation under photolysis and radiolysis has been determined. The effect of polymer resin structure on PAG photoacid generation under photolysis and radiolysis has also been investigated. Concepts for PAG and polymer design for producing enhanced sensitivity resists for excitational and ionizational exposure is discussed.", "Plasma etching is an integral part of semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) processing and is widely used to produce high-resolution patterns and to remove sacrificial layers. Bottom anti-reflective coatings (BARCs) under the resist absorb light to minimize reflectivity during lithography and are typically opened during pattern transfer using plasma etching. High etch selectivity is required in the BARC opening process to minimize resist loss to allow further substrate etching. Because the plasma etch process combines physical bombardment and chemical reaction, the factors affecting etch rate and selectivity are complex. The results are related to etch conditions and the chemical nature of polymer. This paper addresses plasma etch properties as they relate to polymer type and etch gas composition. Polyacrylate, polyester, and polymers containing nitrogen and halogens have been investigated. The research was carried out by a series of designs of experiments (DOEs), which varied the flow rate of Ar, CF4, and O2 in plasma gas. The selectivity of BARC to resist depends not only on the carbon content but also on the different ways polymer compositions and structures respond to an oxidizing gas, a reducing gas, and plasma bombardment. Based on a polymer decomposition mechanism, we discuss what could happen physically and chemically during the polymer's exposure to the high-energy reactive plasmas. We also modified the Ohnishi parameter for the polymers containing nitrogen and halogen using our polymer decomposition theory. The contribution of nitrogen and halogen in the etch equation can be positive or negative depending on the chemical properties of the plasma.", "The pattern shrinkage of semiconductor devices has been achieved by moving to shorter and shorter wavelengths in the optical lithography technologies. According to the ITRS, it is estimated that this trend will be continued through advanced lithography techniques such as Hyper NA immersion lithography, double patterning technique and EUV lithography. In the future, photo-resist film thickness requirements will approach 100 nm or less to achieve suitable aspect ratios. Therefore, organic bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) film thicknesses must also be reduced from the viewpoint of the etching process. Due to these design changes, the performance of BARCs, especially photo-resist profile control and maintaining enough of a lithography process margin at the critical CD has become more crucial. Problem of photo-resist profiles, such as missing holes or scumming for contact holes (C/H) and footing in line-space (L/S) patterns by contamination from the substrate are known as resist poisoning. In order to prevent this issue, BARC films need to have not only reflection control properties but they also need to capable of contamination or poison blocking. Therefore, barrier properties to prevent contamination or poisoning should be included in the design of these new BARC materials. For developing these BARC that are designed to have both barrier properties and reflection control at around 30 nm thickness, we investigated their performance by evaluating both the chemical and physical property of BARC film. The design of these barrier films and details of evaluation experiments are discussed in this paper.", "As chip size and pattern size continue to shrink, the thickness of photo resist is getting thinner and thinner. One of the major reasons is to prevent the small resist features from collapse. It's very challenging to get enough etch resistance from such thin resist thickness. An approach of Si-tri-layer stack which consists of resist, Si ARC (Si contenting anti-reflection coating), organic underlayer from top to bottom has been adopted by many IC makers in the manufacturing of 45 nm node. Even higher resist etching selectivity is needed for 32 nm node. Si ARC, of Si content as high as 43%, provides good etch selectivity. At the same time, tri-layer also provides good control over reflectivity in high NA immersion lithography. However, there are several well know issues concern Si-rich ARC. Resist compatibility and shelf life are on top of the list. An aim of our development work was to overcome those issues in order to produce manufacturing-worthy Si-rich ARC. Several synthesis methods were investigated to form Si-rich ARC film with different properties. Collapse of resist patterns is used as an indicator of lithographic compatibility. Lithographic performance was checked by accelerated shelf life tests at high temperature in order to predict the shelf life at room temperature. It was found that adhesion between resist and Si-rich ARC is improved when contact angle of Si-rich ARC is increased to more than 60 degree. Certain synthesis methods improve shelf life. After optimization of film properties and synthesis methods of Si-rich ARC, SHB-A940 series have best litho compatibility and shelf life is six months at storage temperature below 10\u00b0C.", "As critical dimensions in integrated circuit (IC) device fabrication continue to shrink to less than 90 nm, designing multi-functional organic bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) materials has become a challenge. In this paper, we report novel high performance BARC materials which are simultaneously capable of controlling reflectivity, planarizing on substrate surface, low bias filling without forming voids, low outgassing, high etch selectivity with resists and broad compatibility with resists. The new materials comprise of a chromophore that absorbs at 193 nm to give anti-reflective properties. By intriguing design of the crosslinking system to minimize the amount of low molecular weight additives and the by-product formation in the curing process, low-bias and low sublimation filling without formation of voids are achieved. In addition, the performance of the high etch rate BARC material can be further enhanced by blending with a low k high etch rate (~2.4X) material to achieve ultra high etch rate for ArF lithographic process. The filling properties, etch selectivity, lithographic and outgassing data of the new BARC materials will be presented.", "The use of a conventional thermal cross-link materials such as negative resists, anti-reflective coating (BARC), and planarizing layers does not lead to excellent planarization for multilevel interconnects, and specially via arrays prior to trench patterning for an advance lithography. The large thicknesses bias between the blanket areas and interconnect areas, and between the blanket areas and via arrays are usually observed. This large thickness bias creates problems during next lithography by narrowing the process latitude. Recently, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) technology has been proposed to achieve global planarization. However, the CMP planarization technique is very sensitive to pattern density, and chemical etching reaction had high possibility to increase the dielectric constant. The current CMP technique still requires a new investment in the CMP equipment. In this paper, we reported another novel approach for global planarization using UV cross-link material (XUVTM) and the dielectric ultra violet exposure unit in coater equipment (TOKYO ELECTRON LTD CLEAN TRACKTM). This planar technique provides benefits for reducing the thickness bias observed in the 22-65 nm generation lithography and imprint processes. Using this technique, a remarkable reduction in via topography with 1.1 \u03bcm as a depth and 0.9-1.0 \u03bcm as a diameter has been achieved excellent thickness bias less than 20 nm. And, the planarization of the film obtained from the XUVTM was very high as compared with that of the film obtained from thermal cross-link gap fill material as the reference, particularly under severe coating conditions such as dense patterns.", "The CD shrinkage by thermal reflow technique was frequently used for the formation of contact hole (C/H) of fine size. However, such technique is seldom used for line (trench)/space type patterns with complicate layout, like 6T-SRAM pattern. One of the reasons is the shape distortion of the designed layout after thermal reflow which results in the difficulty in CD control. In this study ultra-thin hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ)-coated ZEP520A trenchs are used to investigate the CD shrinkage effect and integrity of the shape after thermal reflow. 6T-SRAM transistor gate with various width/length (W/L) ratios is used as the test pattern. HSQ diluted by methyl-isobutyl ketone (MIBK) with 1:3 and 1:14 volume ratios was coated on ZEP520A trenchs. Post-applied baking (PAB) conditions of non-HSQ coated ZEP520A are split to find the optimal CD uniformity. The effects of thickness of HSQ, dilution ratio, spin speed of HSQ on the CD and shape after thermal reflow at various temperatures for HSQ-coated ZEP520A trench patterns are also studied. Multiple thermal reflows at 160oC-180oC are applied to obtain the best shrinkage results. It is found that the non-HSQ coated ZEP520A trench with all W/L ratios shrunk at 160oC. The smallest shrunk trench of 33.6 nm top-CD with 1/50 W/L ratio is obtained for HSQ (1:14)-coated ZEP520A for two thermal reflows at 160 oC/90 sec while 35.8 nm top-CD of the same W/L ratio is obtained after one 180oC/90sec reflow. Both sizes could meet the CD requirement of 32nm node and beyond. Above all, the HSQ-coated ZEP520A keeps the shape of trench pattern after one or multiple thermal reflows.", "In this paper, we will describe the principle and the design concerns with and without PFOS of TARC materials, and then make a comparison of TARC and organic bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) which are both anti-reflective coating materials. In our discussions, we will sort the TARC applications, and then discuss the behavior of post-exposure bake (PEB) delay with and without TARC process. After that, we will discuss the material issues which we are faced of Non-PFOS TARCs, such as material being frozen during shipping process, coating performance etc. Then, we will demonstrate the Litho performances and defect results of actual Non-PFOS TARC materials. Finally, we will summarize the evaluation results of Non-PFOS TARC materials.", "Dual damascene processing for back end of the line (BEOL) layers can employ bilayer film stack approaches for lithographic patterning. These bilayer resist systems are more prevalent for KrF layers and have many unique characteristics, including silicon-containing photoresists and gap fill underlayer material that must also act as a bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC). Bilayer resists pattern for copper deposition; as such, defect levels are a critical concern, as any post-patterning bridging or residue defects can often times render an entire die inoperable due to electrical shorts or breaks. Here, two such defect types were found: missing resist patterns and resist residue. Through several experiments and with process optimization, the defect origins were elucidated and the defects themselves significantly reduced. This work will detail the examination, root causes and eventual elimination of these significant bilayer resist defects.", "The stacked-mask process (S-MAP) is a tri-level resist process by lithography and dry etching, which consists of thin resist, spin-on-glass (SOG), and spun-on carbon (SOC). However, as design rules progress below 60nm, two problems arise in the conventional S-MAP: 1) the deformation of SOC line pattern during SiO2 reactive ion etching (RIE), 2) the degradation of lithography performance due to high reflectivity at the interface between resist and SOG in high NA. In this study, we clarified the origin of the above problems and improved S-MAP materials and processes. Firstly, we found that the pattern deformation is induced by the inner stress due to volume expansion by fluorination during RIE, and that the deformation is suppressed by decreasing hydrogen content of SOC. Secondly, we developed new carbon-containing SOG that coexists with low reflectivity and acceptable etching performance. Using the above SOG and SOC, we developed a new S-MAP that shows an excellent lithography / etching performance in sub-45nm device fabrication.", "The present paper describes a novel class of bottom antireflective coating (BARC) and gap fill materials using dextrin derivatives. The general trend of interconnect fabrication for such a high performance LSI is to apply cupper (Cu)/ low-dielectric-constant (low-k) interconnect to reduce RC delay. A via-first dual damascene process is one of the most promising processes to fabricate Cu/ low-k interconnect due to its wide miss-alignment margin. The sacrificial materials containing dextrin derivatives under resist for lithography were developed in via-first dual damascene process. The dextrin derivatives in this study was obtained by the esterification of the hydroxyl groups of dextrin resulting in improved solubility in the resist solvents such as propylene glycol monomethylether, propylene glycol monomethylether acetate, and ethyl lactate due to avoid the issue of defects that were caused by incompatability. The etch rate of our developed BARC and gap fill materials using dextrin derivatives was more than two times faster than one of the ArF resists evaluated in a CF4 gas condition using reactive ion etching. The improved etch performance was also verified by comparison with poly(hydroxystyrene), acrylate-type materials and latest low-k materials as a reference. In addition to superior etch performance, these materials showed good resist profiles and via filling performance without voids in via holes.", "In current semiconductor manufacturing processes, hardmasks have become more prevalent in patterning of small features. A silicon-containing hardmask, which can be spun onto wafers, is desirable in terms of mass production throughput and cost of ownership. Previously, we reported a paper on silicon-based anti-reflective spin-on hardmask materials for 193 nm lithography. In this paper, hardmask materials for 45 nm pattern of immersion ArF lithography are described. To achieve 45 nm patterning, a different base resin platform from the previous paper has been used. Furthermore, we have improved the etch resistance by changing our synthesis method without modifying the resin platform and silicon contents. Despite these changes, an excellent storage stability, which is one of the essential requirements for the materials, is still maintained. Characterization and lithographic performance of 45 nm immersion ArF lithography using our new materials are described in detail.", "The extension of current 193nm immersion lithography technology is depending on increasing the numerical aperture (NA). High-resolution imaging requires the decrease of photoresist thickness to compensate for smaller depth of focus (DOF) and prevent pattern collapse. Poor etch selectivity between photoresist and BARC reads to the use of thinner BARC with faster etch-rate. Also, controlling reflectance over a wider range of incident angles for hyper-NA above 1.0 gives more challenge for thin BARC. To reduce substrate reflectivity, various material strategies (dual-layer BARC such as organic/inorganic BARC or organic/organic BARC, Si-based ARC/spin-on carbon (SOC), and so on) have been introduced through many papers. Organic dual-layer BARC is capable of suppressing reflectivity through wide range of incident angles. But, the inevitable increase of its thickness is not a desirable direction due to the decreasing trend of photoresist thickness. When amorphous carbon (a-C) is used as a hardmask for sub-stack, the combination of organic/inorganic BARC (i.e. SiON) is currently well known process. Si-ARC/SOC may be the promising candidates of hardmask because Si component of Si-ARC affords a high etch selectivity to photoresist and its combination with SOC decreases reflectance. The optical constants of above organic materials can be tuned to control the substrate reflectivity for hyper-NA.", "Most semiconductor companies are using Bottom Anti-Reflective Coating (BARC) on their lithography process to reduce bottom reflectivity, which is cause of standing wave, pattern collapse, and bad pattern profile, and to improve lithographic performance. BARC has been diversified to adapt to the wavelength of exposure light and refractive indices of photoresists and substrates. Recently, many semiconductor companies introduce new process, such as immersion process and double patterning process, to get high resolution for next generation semiconductor and they are trying to apply these processes to their mass production. Among those process solutions, a strong candidate for high resolution is introduction of hyper NA(Numerical Aperture) exposure tool, using immersion process. There is one thing to solve for BARC material when immersion process is applied. It is reflectivity. As NA of exposure tool increases, reflectivity from a substrate also increases, simultaneously. We simulated the difference of reflectivity with increasing NA and we found a proper way how to control reflectivity on immersion process with refractive indices of BARC. We will report simulation data for immersion process and introduce our new developed BARC for hyper NA process in this paper.", "In recent years for memory devices under 70nm using ArF lithography, spin-on organic hardmask has become an attractive alternative process to amorphous carbon layer hardmark (ACL) in mass production due to ACL hardmask's limited capacity, high cost-of-ownership, and low process efficiency in spite of its excellent etch performance. However, insufficient plasma etch resistance of spin-on hardmask makes the etch process an issue resulting in inadequate vertical profiles, large CD bias, and narrow etch process window compared to ACL hardmask. In order to be able to apply these spin on hardmasks to varies layers including critical layers, the aforementioned problems need to be resolved and verified using several evaluation methods including etch pattern evaluation. In this paper, we report the synthesis of novel organic spin-on hardmasks (C-SOH) that incorporate various fused aromatic moieties into polymer chain and the evaluation of etch performance using dry etch tools. Organic spin-on hardmasks with 79-90 wt% carbon contents were synthesized in-house. Oxygen and fluorine based plasma etch processes were used to evaluate the etch resistance of the C-SOH. The results show our 3rd generation C-SOH has etch profiles comparable to that of ACL in a 1:1 dense pattern.", "A family of dye-filled developer-soluble bottom anti-reflective coatings (BARCs) has been developed for use in 193-nm microlithography. This new dye-filled chemical platform easily provides products covering a wide range of optical properties. The light-sensitive and positive-working BARCs use a transparent polymeric binder and a polymeric dye in a thermally crosslinking formulation, with the cured products then being photochemically decrosslinked prior to development. The cured BARC films are imaged and removed with developer in the same steps as the covering photoresist. Two dye-filled BARCs with differing optical properties were developed via a series of DOEs and then used as a dual-layer BARC stack. Lithography with this BARC stack, using a 193-nm resist, gave 150-nm L/S (1:1). A 193-nm dual-layer BARC stack (gradient optical properties) from the well-established dye-attached family of light-sensitive BARCs also gave 150-nm L/S (1:1) with the same resist. However, the latter provided much improved line shape with no scumming. The targeted application for light-sensitive dual-layer BARCs is high-numerical aperture (NA) immersion lithography where a single-layer BARC will not afford the requisite reflection control.", "Beyond 45nm node processes, ArF hyper-NA immersion lithography systems are an inevitable choice for obtaining smaller patterns. A hyper-NA, dual BARC system is proposed to achieve low reflectivity. However, the ability for the resist to ask as a mask is severely challenged because of the increased film thickness associated with a dual BARC system. In order to obtain enough etch selectivity to the substrate, multi-layer resist processes can be applied. General multi-layer resist processes uses silicon containing an inorganic spin-on hard mask and an organic spin-on hard mask with a high carbon content. One of the problems of organic spin-on hard masks is high out-gassing, which can cause defect issues in mass production. We have developed a new organic hard mask with low out-gassing, good reflectivity control (< 0.2%) and good etch durability. Gap-filling performance also can be controlled by changing its fluidity and wettability on the substrate.", "Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) bilayer resist (BLR) processes are attractive to obtain nano-sized features with high aspect ratio by dry-transferring thin e-beam pattern to thick underlayer to strengthen the etch resistance. However, there are drawbacks of high e-beam dosage for HSQ patterning and difficulty in controlling the underlayer resist profile by O2 plasma with anisotropic etching. In this study gap-fill type HSQ/ZEP520A BLR processes were studied to overcome these problems. The advantage of gap-fill type BLR processes is that the dosage for patterning on thick ZEP520A e-beam positive resist is not as high as that for HSQ and the resist profile can be tuned by exposure and development processes without depending on O2 plasma. By gap-filling of HSQ in ZEP520A trench patterns and then stripping ZEP520A by O2 plasma the tone is conversed from trench to line. The gap filling quality attributes include (1) the void size and number of HSQ lines and (2) spacer adhesion on HSQ line edge. Only the non-diluted HSQ solution could completely fill the trench and the HSQ line formed after stripping of ZEP520A. The spacer formed by diluted HSQ is found to be composed of oxide without any ZEP520A-related elements by FTIR analysis. The ZEP520A trench CD monotonically increases with decrease of W/L ratio. The HSQ line CD also follows the same trend. The extension of HSQ in ZEP520A, i.e. HSQ line CD minus ZEP520A trench CD, basically follows the reverse trend. It is therefore concluded that extension of HSQ lines in ZEP520A and HSQ spacers are formed from the diffused HSQ in trench sidewall without any reaction with ZEP520A. Voids were generally observed at the bottom of the HSQ line. Size and quantity of voids are larger for lower W/L ratios, indicating that the voids were formed due to insufficient HSQ volume for gap-filling. Increasing e-beam dose, baking or reflow temperature, and reflow of ZEP520A before HSQ coating could reduce the void formation. Multiple gap-filling with 1:14 diluted HSQ can lead to void-free lines. The HSQ spacer becomes thicker with less diluted HSQ, slower spin speed, reduced ZEP520A development time and HSQ PCB temperature. The smallest HSQ island of 46.3 nm was obtained by two reflows plus HSQ gap filling and baking processes, a significant size for the hardmask of metal island etching or mold of contact-hole nano-imprint for 45 nm node. The width of HSQ spacers is generally within 10-25 nm, potentially applicable to transistor gate patterning in 22 nm node and beyond.", "A new dual bottom antireflectant consisting of an organic antireflectant and a SixOyNz:H (SiON) layer has been designed for metal layers to cover both 45nm and 32nm node logic devices. Simulations have been used to optimize the optical constants of the organic antireflectant. The new antireflectant system has been evaluated on a 1.2NA tool for metal layers. The same organic antireflectant has been successfully applied to via layers at a different thickness. The overall patterning performance including profiles, line width roughness (LWR), overlap depth of focus margin (ODOF) and critical dimension (CD) uniformity before and after etch has been evaluated. The new antireflectant system meets all the patterning requirements for a manufacturable process. An immersion tool at 1.2NA was used to perform lithography tests. Simulation was performed by using ProlithTM software.", "We will discuss our recent results using a second generation radiation sensitive developable 193 Bottom Antireflective coatings (DBARCs). These DBARC materials are made solvent resistant the application of a resist coating on top of them through a crosslinking mechanism that is reversible by acid catalyzed reaction upon exposure of the DBARC/resist stack. Typically this is done by crosslinking a copolymer containing a hydroxyl moiety with a polyfunctional vinylether during post applied bake. This DBARC approach, after exposure, allows for development of the stack in exposed areas down to the substrate eschewing the plasma etch breakthrough needed for conventional bottom antireflective coatings which are irreversibly crosslinked. We will give an update on the performance our latest 193 nm DBARC materials used with different Implant 193 nm resists when using a phase shift mask with off axis illumination.", "A comparison of bake temperature effects on two hardmask materials was performed. The first hardmask was a silicon-based material, BSI.M06092K, and the second was a titanium-based material, BSI.S07051. The materials have inherently different chemistries that performed differently as bake temperature was varied. BSI.M06092K undergoes condensation of silanols on the wafer during baking and BSI.S07051 undergoes removal of the ligand followed by condensation during baking. In general, the performance of BSI.M06092K showed little or no dependency on bake temperature. BSI.S07051 showed an increase in contact angle with water, slower etch rates, and square profiles as bake temperature increased.", "As design rules shrink, the goal for model-based OPC/RET schemes is to minimize the discrepancy between the intended pattern and the printed pattern, particularly among 2d structures. Errors in the OPC design often result from insufficient model calibration across the parameter space of the imaging system and the focus-exposure process window. Full-chip simulations can enable early detection of hotspots caused by OPC/RET errors, but often these OPC model simulations have calibration limitations that result in undetected critical hotspots which limit the process window and yield. Also, as manufacturing processes are improved to drive yield enhancement, and are transferred to new facilities, the lithography tools and processes may differ from the original process used for OPC/RET model calibration conditions, potentially creating new types of hotspots in the patterned layer. In this work, we examine the predictive performance of rigorous physics-based 193 nm resist models in terms of portability and extrapolative accuracy. To test portability, the performance of a physical model calibrated using 1d data from a development facility will be quantified using 1d and 2d hotspot data generated at a different manufacturing facility with a production attenuated-PSM lithography process at k1 < 0.4. To test extrapolative accuracy, a similar test will be conducted using data generated at the manufacturing facility with illumination conditions which differ significantly from the original calibration conditions. Simulations of post-OPC process windows will be used to demonstrate application of calibrated physics-based resist models in hotspot characterization and mitigation.", "As semiconductor design rules continue to shrink, studies have begun on the 32nm-node and 22nm-node generations in semiconductor lithography technology in conjunction with the development of various fine-processing technologies. Research has been especially active in the development of high-NA193nm immersion lithography and EUV lithography for 32nm processes and beyond, but at the present stage of development, many technical issues have been reported. For example, in the contact-hole and via-hole pattern formation process in 193nm immersion lithography, it is difficult to maintain good resolution performance and process margins compared to line and space patterns. Poor resolution and other defects in the lithography process are major factors behind reduced yields in semiconductor production lines, and to prevent such defects, studies have begun on double patterning technology and shrink technology applied after resist-hole-pattern formation. Here, however, the need for reducing production processes and production costs have become major issues. In response to these technical issues, we evaluated a variety of hole-shrink processes as candidates for a fine-hole-pattern formation technology, and as a result of this study, we succeeded in applying an original hole-shrink technology to the formation of 40nm hole patterns and beyond.", "Photoresists containing adamantane derivatives have been widely used with ArF exposure tools. However, the performance characteristics of adamantane derivatives with other optical sources, such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and electron beam (EB) sources, have not been well-studied. To clarify such performance characteristics for several exposure sources, we synthesized acrylic terpolymers containing adamantyl methacrylates as model photopolymers and exposed the resist samples based on these polymers to ArF, EUV and EB radiations. On the basis of the lithographic performance characteristics of these resist samples, we evaluated the performance characteristics of adamantane derivatives upon exposure to different radiations. We discuss the relationship between the chemical structures of adamantane derivatives and lithographic performance characteristics.", "There are some practical candidates for next generation lithography (NGL). However, many subjects are left behind and there is still no effective technique. One of those subjects is reduction of line edge roughness (LER)/line width roughness (LWR). As compared with 2-methyl-2-adamantyl methacrylate which is mostly used in 193nm lithography as acid cleavable monomer, it became clear that our new monomers were effective in reduction of LER/LWR by measuring surface roughness (Ra) with the analysis of atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found out that the monomers which have acetal as acid cleavable unit has high exposure sensitivity and effective in the reduction of Ra. Moreover, we tried to synthesize high refractive index polymer by introducing a sulfur atom that is another subject of NGL. By synthesizing some monomers, it became clear that the bond type of sulfur atom affects a refractive index greatly. It was also checked that a refractive index and transparency have a relation of a trade-off. The adamantyl acrylate monomers are mostly used in 193 nm lithography due to their high transparency and excellent contrast after the development. We have designed and synthesized various monomers based on adamantane moieties from 65nm node forward the 32 nm node. So, we think that it's our duty to challenge from the design of a monomer to those subjects for NGL.", "Plasma trimming is a method widely used to achieve small feature sizes beyond the capability of photolithography. Plasma processes reduce the dimensions of photoresist, anti-reflective coating, hardmask, or device substrate patterns with varying degrees of anisotropy. The vertical trim rate is higher than or equal to the lateral trim rate. As a result, much of the line-edge roughness from the resist pattern remains. High aspect-ratio resist patterns are subject to necking and collapse during this process. However, by using a developer-soluble hardmask in place of traditional anti-reflective layers, it is possible to achieve controllable, anisotropic trim rates, as well as reduced roughness. Moreover, the process benefits from a very thin resist, or imaging layer, instead of relying on a thicker mask with a high aspect-ratio. The hardmask is patterned during a standard resist develop step, and the resist may be stripped prior to substrate etching due to the high etch resistance of the hardmask. Many other advantages have been discovered from this wet trimming process, including high resolution, extended depth of focus, controllable trim rate, and lower cost than traditional methods.", "Since they have been introduced to substitute poly(hydroxystyrene) based 248nm photoresists (PR), 193nm photoresists based on acrylate chemistry have raised issues regarding their dry etch resistance. These resists undergo severe degradations during typical dry etch processes involved in gate patterning, resulting in strong film loss, resist chemical modifications, critical surface roughening and also linewidth roughness (LWR). Other studies have shown that applying plasma treatments to 193nm photoresist patterns prior to the other plasma etching processes is a way to minimize PR degradation. Among these plasma treatments, the HBr plasma cure is known to reinforce the 193nm photoresist etch resistance and to reduce the resist LWR. In this study, we propose to go further in the understanding of cure plasma treatments impact on a 193nm model resist polymer (from Rohm & Haas Electronic Materials) using real time in-situ ellipsometry experiments correlated to several characterization techniques such as in-situ X-Ray Photoelectrons Spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). The impact of Ar and HBr cure plasma treatments on 193nm PR is investigated and compared. Both treatments lead to surface and also bulk modifications of the resist films. XPS analyses show that the 10 first nanometers of the resist film are graphitized after only 20s plasma treatment, resulting in a higher carbon content and therefore indicating a better etch resistance following the Ohnishi parameter. Besides this superficial modification, FTIR show that the resist film can be completely modified after HBr cure plasma treatment with the removal of lactone and leaving groups present in the polymer. The same kinds of modifications are observed with Ar cure plasma treatment but only the first 80nm of the resist film are chemically modified. A significant decrease of the glass transition temperature is also observed with both treatments and is related to lactone and leaving group units that remain in the film Finally, we show that the resist etch resistance is indeed improved if the resist is previously cured. However, in the case of Ar plasma treatment, the etch resistance is only improved while etching the first 80nm chemically modified resist.", "The current semiconductor resist process requires a clean atmosphere for 193-nm immersion exposure. Processing involving such small dimensions and short wavelengths requires an atmosphere with extremely low concentrations of various amines, as well as ammonia. This clean space is secured by using an ion-exchange type chemical filter. In addition, a variety of organic contaminants cannot be ignored. For example, in the exposure process, siloxane and other low molecular weight compounds are transformed into high molecular weight compounds by short-wavelength light, and cause lens fogging. To deal with these organic compounds, an activated carbon filter has been used. This paper establishes an optimized design theory for an ion exchange filter based on the molecular diameters of targeted amines by examining the adsorption of various types of amines by ion-exchange resin. We verified the adsorption behavior of a chemical filter by considering the actual environment around the wafer, and established a clean environment by using adsorption theory for various types of contaminants.", "Without question, one of the most difficult layers to print with a usable process window is the contact level. As the industry moves towards the 45nm node and beyond, the challenges associated with printing contact holes with a manufacturable process window have become increasingly difficult. The authors have taken a two-pronged approach that combines chemical and plasma etch methods in order to shrink contact holes and thus obtain higher resolution. Process windows were looked at using both methods individually, and then with both techniques combined. There are several resolution-enhancing chemical shrink materials on the market. In this discussion of contact resolution enhancement, the authors chose JSR CSX004. A relatively new etch approach, focused on reducing contact hole size, will be demonstrated. The etch process utilizes a SiARC ARC, which acts as a hardmask in order to create an enhanced contact hole. In this paper, the authors will describe an approach that will illustrate a methodology that can be used to produce 45nm node contact resolution in a manufacturing environment. Lithographic process windows, side-wall angles (via SEM cross section) and etch selectivity will be studied in detail.", "In order to shrink down the contact hole which is usually much larger than other patterns, the resist reflow process (RRP) has been widely used. Various types, shapes, and pitches of contact hole arrays are made by RRP, but RRP was limited to be used only for contact hole patterns. The same RRP method is expanded to 32 nm node arbitrary and complex patterns including dense line and space patterns. There might be simple 1-dimensional patterns, but 2-dimensional proximity conflict patterns are difficult to make in general. Specially, the data split with proximity correction needs a lot of attention for double patterning. 32 nm node arbitrary patterns can be easily made by using RRP without complex data split.", "Grayscale lithography is an extension of the conventional binary lithographic process for realization of arbitrary three-dimensional features in photoresist materials, with applications especially in micro-optics fabrication. The grayscale photomask possesses a spatially varying transmission that modulates the exposure dose received in the photoresist. By using a low contrast photoresist, such as those based on diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ), the material is only partially removed during development in proportion to the local exposure dose received. In this way, an arbitrary surface topography can be sculpted in the photoresist material. It is common practice in grayscale lithography to encode the transmission levels of the photomask by using the photoresist contrast curve to determine the exposure dose required for a given photoresist thickness at each lateral point in the pattern. This technique is adequate when the surface topography is slowly varying and the photoresist film is thin. However, it is inaccurate when these conditions are not met, because the technique essentially represents a one-dimensional approximation to the lithographic process where the isotropy of the development and the diffractive imaging of the photomask are neglected. Currently we are applying grayscale lithography to the fabrication of a fiber-to-waveguide coupler based on the parabolic reflector, where the efficiency of the device is quite sensitive to fabrication errors in the coupler geometry. In this case the thin photoresist and slowly varying topography conditions are not met, and we turn to more comprehensive process models to determine the appropriate transmission levels to encode in the photomask. We demonstrate that the photomask can be optimized, based on simulation of the lithography process, to produce the required three-dimensional photoresist pattern.", "Exposure wavelength has been changing dramatically as semiconductor design rules shrink, and for 32nm-node fine processes and beyond, it is predicted that the drop in optical contrast when using 193nm immersion lithography exposure technology will make it difficult to ensure good resolution performance in fine and dense resist patterns. To address this problem, studies have begun on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology and double patterning technology that uses 193nm immersion lithography as alternative technologies, but many problems have been reported at the present stage of development. Against the above background, we investigated various process flows with the aim of reducing production processes and cost in double patterning technology that uses 193nm immersion lithography. We consequently developed an advanced process technique for use after 1st resist pattern formation and established a litho-litho-etch (LLE) process. The application of this technology decreases the number of total processes used in ordinary double patterning technology. In this paper, we focus on double patterning technology in 193nm immersion lithography and report on the performance of our original advanced process technique and on our evaluation of double patterning technology.", "We report about the development of a thick negative photoresist series, AZ(R) EXP 125nXT, and their use in electroplating levels up to 160 \u03bcm thickness. The new photoresist series enables coatings of 5-120 \u03bcm with acceptable uniformity and edge bead in a single coat step. 200 \u03bcm photoresist coating was achieved by a double coating processes. The lithographic performance of the photoresists was evaluated using broad band aligners and steppers. Optimized lithographic parameters to achieve straight and nearly vertical side wall profiles are reported. The photoresists show not only excellent adhesion to copper with no surface treatment and electroplating tolerance in a variety of metal plating solutions, but is also compatible with silicon and gold substrates. The photoresists have been found to be easily stripped with no residues in solvent based stripper solutions.", "We synthesized several new monomers with an acid-cleavable protective group and investigated their deprotection reactions. Polymers were prepared using these monomers, and their thermal properties and dissolution rates were investigated. The acidic reactivity of protective groups of these monomers was evaluated using a method we developed. The activation energies [Ea(experimental)] calculated using reaction rate constants were found to correlate to some extent with the activation energies [Ea(calculated)] calculated from MOPAC. The dissolution rates of some polymers containing similar protective groups as structures were measured. The dissolution rates were related to the polarity and molecular volume (MV) of the decomposed products of protective groups.", "As line width roughness (LWR) and depth of focus (DoF) become the critical lithography challenges, there is a growing interest in applying surface conditioner solutions during post-develops process to increase DoF and reduce LWR. Previous work1 has demonstrated that a significant LWR reduction and DoF increase can be achieved through the utilization of a surface conditioner in the features of lines/spaces patterned for 45nm node by immersion lithography. However, the previous generation surface conditioner is not able to provide effective LWR improvement for the resist pattern having LWR less than 5nm. In this paper, 45nm lines/spaces features, having 4.8nm LWR, were patterned using immersion lithography to evaluate a newly-formulated surface conditioner's performance on LWR reduction. The results showed there is about 20% LWR reduction and the LWR was reduced to 4nm, which indicates the newly-formulated surface conditioner is capable of doing further LWR reduction on the pattern whose LWR is less than 5nm. In addition, surface conditioners were applied to extend the capability of 193nm \"dry\" lithography process window below the k2 = 0.3 threshold by DoF increase. The result demonstrated there is a significant process improvement on DoF which results in a usable DoF process window in practice comparable to that of \"wet\" lithography process.", "In its relatively short history of use, the formulation complexity of bottom anti-reflective coatings (BARC) for semiconductor fabrication has become an enabling technology for nanoscale chip geometries. As lithography advancements are mastered, process material and equipment capabilities must follow. Typical photochemical solutions contain a variety of additives, often in trace amounts. The slightest unintended alteration of the photochemical formulation's chemical composition could have a detrimental effect on lithography process yield. The added complexity of BARC formulations leads suppliers of liquid microcontamination control technologies to develop filtration solutions that effectively remove the destructive particles and gels from BARC while maintaining the formulation's integrity during the filtration process. In a joint study, Entegris and Brewer Science discovered that nylon has proven to be less chemically resistant to attack by certain BARC materials than next-generation ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UPE) membrane materials. Essentially, UPE membrane-based filters remove the damaging particulate and gels without altering the delicate chemical formulation of BARC materials. It has also been experimentally proven that the UPE-based membrane maintains its material integrity during the filters' lifetime. This provides new opportunities for fabs and photochemical suppliers to enhance the performance, repeatability and reliability of semiconductor lithography processes.", "Two types of chemically amplified (CA) negative resists were compared lithographically. An acid catalyzed resist and a photopolymerizable type resist. The optimum lithographic performance of the acid catalyzed resist on Cu is in the thickness range below 15\u03bcm, with vertical profiles. This resist exhibits inverted profiles on Cu above 15\u03bcm of thickness. The Photopolymer type resist performs best above 25\u03bcm thickness, and can be used for 120\u03bcm thick applications with single coat. Top line rounding is more observed with this resist as its applied thickness is reduced below 20\u03bcm. This effect is believed to be related to oxygen uptake in the resist surface. Thus it has a more pronounced effect at relatively thinner films. Both resists are compatible with the electroplating process.", "This study reports on stain defect reduction on KrF, ArF and Immersion resist system. Stain defects that appear after develop are a common problem with i-line, KrF, ArF and ArF-immersion resists. Last year we reported a reduction of this type of defect by optimizing the developer process. However, that optimized process used a long rinse time, and this negatively impacts throughput. In this work, we designed a novel develop process that reduced stain defects on the resist. Previous work showed that stain defect formation was mainly governed by the develop process conditions. Hence, in this work we focused on develop system improvements. On this system we identified the process both significantly reduced stain defect count and used a shorter develop process time. In addition to reducing defect count, we identified the mechanism of reduction of the stain defect. This was done by analyzing the composition of the defect.", "Resist reflow techniques have widely been adopted for lithography in resolution limited region. During the reflow process, resist patterns are heated over its glass temperature through number of temperature steps. Early works have focused how the temperature steps during heat-up process can be effectively controlled for critical dimension (CD) and the pattern profile after reflow. However, for a specific application that needs moderate CD and profile change, adjusting heat-up parameters would not be sufficient to achieve good CD and profile control and additional relevant parameters should be accounted. In this paper, we count surface treatment condition on reflow process as an additional control parameter. We measured CDs with varying surface treatment parameters of substrate on square arrays of resist islands with 300 nm island-to-island gap space. We found that the amount of after develop CD to after reflow CD bias decreases as contact angles of substrates increases. In conclusion, we prove the resist reflow CD can be controlled precisely by adjusting the substrate coverage of hydroxyl groups during adhesion treatments in addition to the temperatures for the resist reflow process.", "Dissolution rates of molecular glass photoresists in supercritical CO2 have been measured with the assistance of an interferometric dissolution rate monitor coupled to the supercritical CO2 vessel. Data show that fully protected polyphenolic molecular glass cores can show dissolution rates >500 nm/min depending on processing conditions. This extends to large branched structures and ring-type molecules approaching molecular weight 2000 g/mol. Molecular glass resists of this type that possess glass transition temperatures above 100oC can be patterned and developed in scCO2 with resolution <65 nm. Using these concepts, positive-tone photoresists based on acid-catalyzed decrosslinking reactions have also been developed. This represents the first report of intrinsically positive tone photoresists developable in pure scCO2.", "This paper investigates the feasibility of using an electrostatic chuck (ESC) on a post exposure bake (PEB) plate in the track to improve the critical dimension uniformity (CDU) for bowed wafers. Although it is more conventional to consider vacuum chucking during PEB, electrostatic chucking offers some potential advantages, chief among which is the fact that electrostatic chucking does not require any type of a seal between the wafer and the PEB plate whereas vacuum chucking does. Such a seal requires contact and therefore has the potential to generate backside particles on the wafer. Electrostatic chucking therefore has the potential for a cleaner overall process. Three different PEB plates were tested in the course of this investigation, a non-chucking PEB plate (SRHP), a PEB plate equipped with a vacuum chuck (VRHP), and a PEB plate equipped with an ESC (eBHP). It was found that CD uniformities were up to 84 percent lower for bowed wafers that were chucked during PEB relative to wafers that were not chucked. In every case tested, wafers processed through chucking PEB plates showed lower CDUs than wafers processed through the non-chucking plate. CDU results were similar between vacuum chucked wafers and electrostatic chucked wafers. Based on the results presented in this paper, it can be concluded that electrostatic chucking during PEB is a feasible method for controlling CD uniformities on bowed wafers.", "Epoxy-novolak thick film resists are of interest for applications where the resist pattern remains in the device serving as mechanical alignment aids, micro channels or protection layers. For these applications, good mechanical properties are of interest. Unfortunately mechanical strength comes with high cross-linking density and, therefore, high tensile stress. We report here on a comparison of three commercially available thick film resists with respect to the following criteria: thickness and uniformity on high topography wafers, i-line photo speed, adhesion on Si3N4, hardness and plasticity, glass transition temperature and wafer warp. The three resists (2 types of SU-8 [MicroChem Corp.] and one type of TMMR [Tokyo Ohka Co., LTD]) show different behavior as a result of the different solvent, photo-acid-generator (PAG) and polymer properties, and trade-offs have to be made depending on the applications.", "As we move toward printing sub-100nm features using 193nm dry photolithography with high-contrast photoresists, effects of mask transmission and pattern density start to play an important role in critical dimension uniformity (CDU). With these two factors in existence, the linewidth for a dense feature block gradually increases from the center to the edge of the array of the block. This change in CD is typically observed for low-transmission reticles. In this paper, we have characterized variables, such as reticle tone and resist processing parameters, which have an effect on the CD uniformity. Use of high-contrast photoresist can increase the effect of chemical flare and can have higher CDU. We have further shown that by using a topcoat or by making changes in the resist bake temperature and time, the effect of chemical flare can be reduced. We also propose a mechanism by which resists exhibit this characteristic and show that both the photoacid generator and quencher can contribute to chemical flare.", "The development of semiconductor chips is making progress with an astonishing speed, enabling electronic apparatus smaller, higher speed, and higher performance. This dynamic advancement is significantly attributable from the development of photolithography technology. At an early era of integrated circuits (IC) manufacturing lithography technique was introduced with light source of g-line wavelength (436 nm). For further miniaturization of IC the wavelength of light source is getting shorter and shorter, i.e., i-line (365 nm), KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm). Currently ArF immersion is actively investigated as the most advanced technology, and EUV (13.5 nm) is discussed as the next generation lithography. Chemically amplified (CA) resist is mainly employed for the study of the advanced lithography. The CA resist is composed of polymer bearing acid-labile groups and photoacid generator (PAG). Photolytic decomposition of PAG during light exposure generates acids in the CA resist. This acid acts as catalyst to facilitate de-protection reaction of ester group or acetal group of polymer, rendering polymer matrix alkaline-soluble. For achieving desired resist performance such as resolution, depth-of-focus, line edge roughness and etching resistance, the acid-labile polymers have been intensively studied first and developed notably. For further improvement of the CA resist, PAG is the key ingredient. We have developed new oxime sulfonate type PAGs releasing strong acid. A series of oxime sulfonate compounds with various chromophors have been synthesized and the application-relevant properties are presented in this paper.", "Novel ester acetal polymers can be synthesized by the reaction of common aromatic dicarboxylic acids with divinyl ether compound in the presence of organic solvent. These polymers have good solubility in commonly used solvents. The molecular weights of the acetal polymers are measured 6000 - 7000(Mn) with Mw/Mn of 1.5-2.5. The polymers show high thermal stability. The acidolytic reaction of the polymers undergoes rapidly at room temperature or at a little higher temperature. Making use of the acidolysis activity at room temperature of the acetal polymer, we can form new type of chemically amplified positive i-line photoresist with the main contents including phenolic resin, the acetal polymer and PAG(s-triazine). Clear pattern with resolution of 2-3&mgr;m was obtained in the lithographic experiment of the photoresist. The photosensitivity of the photoresist is below 50mj/cm2.", "It is necessary to make small sized flash cells for high density flash products and it is indispensable to minimize the line and space widths of Metal lines in such a high density Flash chips. To minimize a line and space widths, the thickness of photo resists must be reduced for the process margin of photo lithography. but the reduced thickness of photo resists is normally not enough for metal etch. So hard masks are needed for metal etch. In this study we have made a metal-etch process with KrF photo resists and oxide hard mask which has lines and spaces with 120 by 120nm. We have used TEOS film as an oxide hard mask for metal etch and have made an ex-situ process to open the hard mask for metal etch, in this ex-situ hard-mask-open process we have had bad line-edge-roughness (LER) problems but we have found out the main effective parameters for LER by DOE methods and various experiments and have finally optimized the process conditions. After the hard-mask-open process, metal line can be patterned with photo resist and oxide hard mask. The side wall profile of metal lines made by oxide hard mask are different from those made by normal photo resist mask because the types and quantities of by-products from oxide masks are different from those from photo resists during etch process. Normally by-products or polymer could be re-deposited to the side wall of metal lines, so they could be protected from possible side-wall-attacks. However due to the lack of by-products from oxides, the side wall of metal lines could be damaged if they were etched only with oxide-hard-masks, so we have had a experiment of metal lines' profile characteristics according to the ratio of photo resist's thickness to oxide hard mask's thickness, and have found out that the ratio of photo resist to oxide hard mask has a significant role in metal line profiles. Despite those side wall profile problems, eventually we have optimized a condition by adjusting the proper thickness of oxide-hard-masks and by tuning the process gas in the series of etch process. Finally in 90nm s-Flash device fabrication, we have made the metal lines with the same high qualities as those of 130nm devices from the view point of profiles and Electro Migration characteristics.", "Defectivity requirements are constantly put to new standards, even in older factories where new toolsets aren't a feasible alternative. To prolong the life of this equipment, Integrated Designs has created the digital dispense valve system. Tracks with older pump systems are plagued with repeatability and suckback issues that are key factors in eliminating or reducing defectivity. The digital dispense system not only increases the pump's capability to hold suckback across significant amounts of idle time regardless of viscosity, but also allows for lower dispense volumes due to more repeatable dispenses. Combining these factors results in a significant decrease in defectivity with only minor equipment additions, that previously would have required costly pump and track upgrades.", "In this study, we reported on the evaluation result of the optimized high voltage gate patterning in liquid crystal display (LCD) driver integrated circuit (IC) with its preparation, characterization and composition of each parameter such as etching gas chemistry, RF power, and pressure. The patterning process of high voltage gate oxide was performed with the CF4/CHF3/O2/Ar based gas chemistry to avoid the leakage current from high voltage gate stack by non-uniform remnant gate oxide thickness. Albeit we obtained the minimized fluctuation of gate oxide thickness, the plasma damage by plasma patterning process affected the leakage current of high voltage gate film stack. In conclusion, we found that the major parameter for leakage current in high voltage gate stack by DOE method of gate patterning and achieved that the optimized condition of high voltage gate patterning. To optimize the performance of high voltage gate oxide, the thickness of remnant oxide must be controlled uniformly in gate patterning for improving the margin of high voltage gate transistor. Verifying that the patterning performance of physical and electrical characteristics with analytical tools such as secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and probe station as well.", "We investigated that Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) dry etching process using SiO2 hard-mask and KrF photo-resist in 90nm stand-alone flash device. As shrinkage of design rule, the thickness of photo-resist is reduced because of guarantee for process margin in photolithographic process, but the etch process margin is smaller. For the reason, the hard-mask system for etch is needed. Generally, the STI dry etching process is composed of two or three steps, such as the ARC etch, the hard-mask etch, and the Si etch. In order to etch multi-stacked layer (ARC, Oxide hard-mask (SiO2), Si3N4 as CMP stopping layer, and Si), we have controlled the parameters of etching (plasma power, gas, and pressure). In the SiO2 hard-mask and Si3N4 layer etching process, we use a mixture chemistry of CF4, CHF3, O2, and Ar and get an optimized condition for the multi-layer system. The SiO2 layer is role of mask for Si layer because the selectivity between SiO2 and Si is superior to others. Finally, we get a good horizontal and vertical profile of STI by using a mixture chemistry of Cl2, HBr, and O2.", "The develop process of traditional Novolac I-line resists with 2.38% TMAH developers was optimized at 60 second puddle time. This process was embedded in the lithographers' tradition, and so it was transferred to newer resist technologies i.e. CA resists. The dissolution rate of exposed I-line resists is in the order of 1000A/sec, while KrF resists have dissolution rate of ~12,000A/sec, and ArF resists at ~60,000A/Sec. The resist thickness of KrF and ArF resists is usually less than 0.5 micron, which means that the exposed film is dissolved within a fraction of the first second. The extended exposure of the resist features to developer was found to be a major reason for defects described as flying lines in center. There are two routes to eliminate the extended development of the resist: one is to dilute the developer as a method for improving the contrast and reducing the dissolution rate. This approach is very demanding and involves renewing the OPE data package, adding a new line to the tracks with a new material that is not a standard developer, but a special dilution. The other option is reduce develop time in order to minimize the attack on the resist-substrate interface, and resist edge. Experiments were run at 10, 20, 25 and 40-second puddle time, showing only a minor increase in exposure energy is necessary to reach CD target. OPE data was checked by simulation and SEM measurements, showing no significant difference between 60 and 25 second puddle time. Reducing puddle time improved defect density and eliminated the phenomenon of flying lines in the center.", "This study combines simulation and experiment to compare the impact that changing BARC thickness around some nominal value has on the resist profile, on an underlying reflective surface. Process window and profile effects are an important part of understanding how a BARC interacts with the resist's parameters to affect the latitude in the light of imperfect reflection control. Reflectivity simulations are made using MATLAB(r); and ProlithTM that show the effect of choosing refractive index and thickness in a multi-layer bottom anti-reflecting coating (BARC). Trends are identified for the better operating values for the index as well as specific values that meet the criterion for organic BARC in a front end application on a reflective substrate. Experimental profiles are compared to simulation using a calibrated resist model for nominal, better and ideal BARC stacks. Reflectivity, as a function of angle in resist, is convolved with the diffraction intensity distribution. This reflection, determined by a pitch's diffraction angle, identifies what can become problematic in setting up a process. Depolarization causes are discussed and while their impact affects image formation, there is little difference in reflection.", "As the IC product scribe line of logic 90nm (L90) technology shrinks from 80\u00b5m to 62\u03bcm, the wafer quality (W.Q.), will become weak and less distinguishable during the subsequent ASML scanner stepper's photo mask aligning. Many wafers having photo mask aligning errors will eventually lead to wafer scrapping. In order to improve the photo alignment signal (W.Q.) acquired from the relatively smaller 62\u03bcm scribe-line's alignment mark while proceeding with the VIA layer photo aligning directly to its previous metal layer, it is found that removing the TiN hard mask (H.M.) just above the previous inter-metal dielectric (IMD) and alignment mark area can help the deep ultra-violet (DUV) 193nm wavelength ASML scanner stepper successfully acquires a better alignment signal and alignment accuracy (A.A.). However, due to copper (Cu) residues and CMP dishing after metal copper CMP, it has been found that both large area \"half size open\" and \"full size open\" approaches for TiN removing in the scribe-line alignment area can not be used. Hence, for safer photolithography aligning margin the \"sizing + 0.25\u03bcm\" mark on the scribe line's photo alignment area is suggested for better signal acquiring, whose experimental results in UMC shows that around 90% of the alignment signal (W.Q.) can be verified. The alignment accuracy (A.A.) can also be improved through using this technique and is accurate enough as compared to the conventional scanner alignment method used for above 0.13\u03bcm generation technology.", "In order to address new technology requirements, Spray Photoresist Dispense Processing has been developed to aid in the manufacturing of High Aspect Ratio devices. The choice of process pump to affect the Spray Process is critical to the results, as the dispense uniformity is greatly influenced by the type of pump used to supply fluid to the Ultra Sonic dispense nozzle. Previous methods used had insufficient ramp rate of the dispense output. The pressure on demand dispense unit has excellent ramp rate to required flow rate, and the Patented Control Technology provides stability within tolerance to improve overall uniformity. The implementation of this method will improve cycle time and reduce the processing cost of wafers.", "To keep in pace with the highly accelerated speed of development of EUV resists, the use of the pressure rise method in the screening of EUV resist outgassing was utilized. This method was used for its advantage of in-situ applicability and evaluation speed (short evaluation time). Both \u201coutgassing rate\u201d [molecules/cm2/s] and \u201coutgassing amount\u201d [molecules/cm2] unit conventions have been obtained. In the conference, an overview of the latest EUV resist outgassing analysis results using various EUV resists (i.e. chemical amplified, PHS, acrelate, high Ea, low Ea, negative-tone, molecular, etc.) will be discussed in detail.", "Two types of EUV resists based on poly(4-hyrdoxystyrene) (PHS) were designed, i.e., PHS-bound sensitizer (PHS-FISS) and PHS/sensitizer blend (PHS/FITS). Imino sulfonate compounds were used as a photosensitizer. A PHS-bound sensitizer resist was prepared by the conventional radical copolymerization of 4-(tertbutyldimethylsilyl)oxystyrene (MSOST) and 9-fluorenilideneimino p-styrenesulfonate (FISS) and subsequent de-silylation of the copolymer. PHS with low molecular weight distribution was obtained by the anionic polymerization of MSOST and followed by de-silylation of the polymer. It was found that both types of resist were negative type and highly sensitive ( 10-20 mJ/cm2 ) on exposure at 254 nm and 13.5 nm. In the case of blended resist, the sensitivity was dependent on the amounts of sensitizer added and molecular weight of PHS. Outgassing from the present resists on EUV exposure was lower than that observed for MET-2D resist.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resist outgassing is viewed as one of the main factors to be considered in the research and development of EUV resists. The release of resist by outgassing in a high-vacuum EUV exposure tool system can mean contaminated optics which in effect causes a decrease in EUV energy reaching the wafer surface. An energy decrease could translate to lower throughputs and lesser productivity. In this paper, the quantification of resist outgassing upon EUV exposure is discussed. Special attention is given to the variation of resist outgassing quantification between evaluation tools of different beam intensities using the pressure rise method. Besides the commonly used resist outgassing rate calculation, the utilization of the resist outgassing amount as basis for comparison is proposed. Three types of resists were analyzed in two resist outgassing evaluation tools of different EUV beam intensities. As a result, resist outgassing rate was found to vary 19 to 109 times between evaluation tools. In contrast, resist outgassing amount was found to vary 1 to 2 times between evaluation tools. From these results, it is proposed that resist outgassing evaluations be performed using resist outgassing amount.", "Low molecular weight materials that form a stable glass above room temperature offer several advantages comparison with traditional linear polymers as patterning feature size decreases. Low molecular weight amorphous materials that are free from chain entanglements with smaller molecular size and high density of sterically congested peripheral molecules are expected to reduce the variations in line edge roughness (LER) at smaller feature dimensions. In addition, the small uniform molecular size offers excellent processability, flexibility, transparency and uniform dissolution properties based on elemental composition. The evaluation of the novel low molecular weight amorphous resists was carried out both at NewSUBARU synchrotron facility of University of Hyogo, and at ASET EUV process technology research lab. in Japan. Newly synthesizes low molecular weight resist has shown high performance of sensitivity and resolution under EB or EUV exposures and also etch resistance. In this paper, we outline the design and synthesis of new molecular weight resists. The material properties, photochemistry and the patterning capability of these newly synthesizes low molecular weight resist will be discussed.", "In order to improve EUVL resist characteristics, especially sensitivity, we have investigated two types of partially fluorinated resist polymers. The one was side chain fluorinated PHS type resist polymers. The other was main chain fluorinated resist polymers. Poly (p-hydroxystyrene) (PHS) type polymers with trifluorostyrene (TFSt) were synthesized and characterized their sensitivity behavior. From this evaluation, we found that PHS contained TFSt unit had a high sensitivity, keeping their etching durability. We expect that TFSt unit can work to enhance the resist sensitivity in PHS based EUVL resist polymers. Main chain fluorinated polymers based FIT unit (FITMAd and FITAdOM) were synthesized. FITMAd and FITAdOM showed high sensitivity compared to non fluorinated reference sample. From molecular weight measurement, we infer that the polymer main chain of FITMAd can be decomposed by irradiating with EUV light. The outgassing of FITMAd and FITAdoM were measured. There is no big difference between the total outgassing of FIT polymers and that of non fluorinated acrylic sample. And small amount of Hydrogen fluoride (HF) were detected. We infer that FITMAd and FITAdOM are decomposed then HF is generated under EUV exposure. From these results, we expect that FIT unit can work to enhance the resist sensitivity and can act main chain decomposed resist unit in EUVL resist polymers.", "We constructed CD budget for spacer patterning technology which is one of the strongest candidates in double patterning technologies for below 3x nm half pitch generations. In the CD budgeting, three patterning portions of grid patterns should be considered, namely, \"line\", \"paired space\" and \"adjoined space\", because they have individual process error sources that affect CD variations. Analysis of the patterning process flow revealed that the amount of CD variations for positive type spacer patterning technology was in the order of \"adjoined space\" > \"paired space\" > \"line\". Also, the experimental verifications in CD variations substantiated the constructed CD budget. From the viewpoint of design for manufacturability (DfM), these process features should be taken into account in the device engineering. Therefore, for the successful implementation of spacer patterning technology into high-end devices, we propose a cross- functional development scheme encompassing device technologies and process technologies using the constructed CD budget.", "Double patterning lithography - either with two litho and etch steps or through the use of a sacrificial spacer layer, have equal complexity and particularly tight requirements on CDU and Overlay. Both techniques pose difficult challenges to process control, metrology and integration, but seem feasible for the 32nm node. In this paper, we report results in exploring CDU and overlay performance at 32nm 1/2 pitch resolution of two double patterning technology options, Dual Photo Etch, LELE and sidewall spacer with sacrificial layer. We discuss specific aspects of CD control present in any double patterning lithography, the existence of multiple populations of lines and spaces, with overlay becoming part of CDU budget. The existence of multiple and generally uncorrelated CD populations, demands utilization of full field and full wafer corrections to bring together the CDU of these multiple populations in order to meet comparable 10% CDU as in single exposure. We present experimental results of interfield and intrafield CD and overlay statistical and spatial distributions confirming capability to improve these distributions to meet dimensional and overlay control levels required by 32nm node. After compensation, we achieved a CDU control for each population, of 2nm or better and 3nm overlay on multiple wafers and multiple state of art, hyper NA immersion scanners. Results confirmed our assumptions for existence of multiple CDU populations entangled overlay into CDU.", "Double Patterning is investigated at IMEC as a timely solution to meet the 32nm node requirements. It further extends the use of water immersion lithography at its maximum numerical aperture NA=1.35. The aim of DP is to make dense features possible by splitting a design into two more sparse designs and by recombining into the target pattern through a double patterning flow (stitching). Independently of the implementation by the EDA vendors and designers, we discuss some guidelines for split and for DP-compliant design to ensure a robust stitching through process variations. We focus more specifically on the first metal interconnect patterning layer (metal1) for random logic applications. We use both simulations and experiments to study the patterning of 2D split test patterns varied in a systematic way.", "Lithography becomes much more challenging when CD shrinks to 22nm nodes. Since EUV is not ready, double patterning combined with Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET) such as shrink techniques seems to be the most possible solution. Companies such as TSMC[1] and IBM[2] etc. are pushing out EUV to extend immersion ArF lithography to 32nm/22nm nodes. Last year, we presented our development work on 32nm node contact (50nm hole at 100nm pitch) using dry ArF lithography by double patterning with SAFIER shrink process[3]. To continue the work, we further extend our dry litho capability towards the 22nm node. We demonstrated double patterning capability of 40nm holes at 80nm pitch using ASML XT1400E scanner. It seems difficult to print pitches below 140nm on dry scanner in single exposure which is transferred into 70nm pitch with double patterning. To push the resolution to 22nm node and beyond, we developed ArF immersion process on ASML XT1700i-P system at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (Albany, NY) combined with a SAFIER process. We achieved single exposure process capability of 25nm holes at 128nm pitch after shrink. It enables us to print ~25nm holes at pitch of 64nm with double patterning. Two types of hard mask (HM), i.e. TIN and a-Si were used in both dry and immersion ArF DP processes. The double patterning process consists of two HM litho-shrink-etch steps. The dense feature is designed into two complementary parts on two masks such that the density is reduced by half and minimum pitch is increased by at least a factor of 21/2 depending on design. The complete pattern is formed after the two HM litho-shrink-etch steps are finished.", "Variation in the critical dimension (CD) of a transistor is a primary concern for advanced lithography. Because variation from sources such as corner rounding or line edge roughness does not scale with CD, variability in transistor performance increases with scaling and may impact the timing or even the functionality of critical circuits such as static random access memories (SRAM) and ring oscillators. Spacer lithography is an attractive patterning method for future technology nodes, because its use of a very uniform and controllable chemical vapor deposition (CVD) step allows for the definition of very narrow lines with low variation and reduced pitch1,2. In practice, however, the possible pitch reductions are limited by the need for conventional lithography to produce negative features (e.g., trenches and holes) and increasing CD variability with iterated spacer processing. In this work, an extension to spacer lithography is presented to overcome these limitations. Negative features down to 30nm in width are fabricated using spacer-defined features. A multi-tiered hard mask process is also presented to enable eight-fold pitch reduction with no increase in CD variation. In combination, these processes enable ultra-dense circuit integration for regular layouts.", "The spacer patterning technique (SPT) is well known as one of the methods expanding the resolution limit and mainly useful for patterning line & space of memory device. Although contact array could be achieved by both spacer patterning technique and double exposure & etch technique (DEET) 1, the former would be preferable to the latter by the issues of overlay burden and resolution limit of isolated contact. The process procedure for contact array is similar to that for line & space which involves the 1st mask exposure, etch, carbon polymer deposition, the 2nd mask exposure and etch step sequentially. With SPT, it would be possible to realize contact array of 30nm half pitch including 30nm isolated contact as well as line & space of 30nm half pitch.", "A double patterning (DP) process is introduced with application for advanced technology nodes. This DP technique is enabled by a novel low-temperature pulsed deposition layer (PDLTM) oxide film which is deposited directly on patterned photoresist. In this article, we will report the results of fabrication of sub-50nm features on a 100nm pitch by the PDL-spacer DP process using 0.85 NA dry ArF lithography. This result represents the potential of the PDL-based DP to significantly enhance the resolution of the patterning process beyond the limits of optical lithography. Components of CD variance for this spacer DP scheme will be discussed.", "Novel RET-Pixelated Phase Mask (PPM) is proposed as a novel Resolution Enhancement Technique (RET). PPM is made of pixels of various phases with lateral dimensions significantly smaller than the illuminating radiation wavelength. Such PPM with a singular choice of pixel dimensions acts as a mask with variable phase and transmission due to radiation scattering and attenuation on pixel features with the effective intensity and phase modulated by the pixel layout. Key properties of the pixelated phase masks, the steps for their practical realization, and the benefits to random logic products discussed. Wafer patterning performance and comparative functional yield results obtained for a 65nm node microprocessor patterned with PPM, as well as current PPM limitations are also presented.", "In this paper, a new resolution enhancement technique named 2D-TCC technique is proposed. This method can enhance resolution of line patterns as well as that of contact hole patterns by the use of an approximate aerial image. The aerial image, which is obtained by 2D-TCC calculation, expresses the degree of coherence at the image plane of a projection optic considering mask transmission at the object plane. OPC of desired patterns and placement of assist patterns can be simultaneously performed according to an approximate aerial image called a 2D-TCC map. Fast calculation due to truncation of a series in calculating an aerial image is another advantage. Results of mask optimization for various line patterns and the validity of the 2D-TCC technique by simulations and experiments are reported.", "In this paper, we will present comparison of attenuated phase shift mask and binary intensity mask at hyper-NA immersion scanner which has been the main stream of DRAM lithography. Some technical issues will be reported for polarized illumination in hyper-NA imaging. One att.PSM (Phase Shift Mask) and three types of binary intensity mask are used for this experiment; those are ArF att.PSM ( MoSi:\u00c5 ), thick Cr ( 1030\u00c5 ) BIM (Binary Intensity Mask), thin Cr ( 590\u00c5 ) BIM and multi layer ( Cr:740\u00c5 / MoSi:930\u00c5 ) BIM. Simulation and experiment with 1.35NA immersion scanner are performed to study influence of mask structure, process margin and effect of polarization. Two types of DRAM cell patterns are studied; one is an isolation pattern with a brick wall shape and another is a storage node pattern with contact hole shape. Line and space pattern is also studied through 38nm to 50nm half pitch for this experiment. Lithography simulation is done by in-house tool based on diffused aerial image model. EM-SUITE is also used in order to study the influence of mask structure and polarization effect through rigorous EMF simulation. Transmission and polarization effects of zero and first diffraction order are simulated for both att.PSM and BIM. First and zero diffraction order polarization are shown to be influenced by the structure of masking film. As pattern size on mask decreases to the level of exposure wavelength, incident light will interact with mask pattern, and then transmittance changes for mask structure. Optimum mask bias is one of the important factors for lithographic performance. In the case of att.PSM, negative bias shows higher image contrast than positive one, but in case of binary intensity mask, positive bias shows better performance than negative one. This is caused by balance of amplitude between first diffraction order and zero diffraction order light. Process windows and mask error enhancement factors are measured with respect to various design rules, i.e., different k1 levels at fixed NA. In the case of one dimensional line and space pattern, thick Cr BIM shows the best performance through various pitches. But in case of two dimensional DRAM cell pattern, it is difficult to find out the advantage of BIM for sub-45nm. It needs further study for two dimensional patterns. Finally, it was observed that thick Cr binary intensity mask for sub-45nm has advantage for one dimensional line and space pattern.", "This work describes the advantages, tolerances and integration issues of using Pixelated Phase Masks for patterning logic interconnect layers. Pixelated Phase Masks (PPMs) can act as variable high-transmission attenuated phase shift masks where the pixelated phase configuration simultaneously optimizes OPC and SRAF generation. Thick mask effects help enable PPMs by allowing larger minimum pixel sizes and phase designs with near equal sized zero and piphase regions. PPMs with a 3-tone pixel mask (un-etched glass, etched glass, chrome) offer more flexible patterning capability compared to 2-tone pixel mask (no chrome) style but at the detriment of a more complex mask making process. We describe the issues and opportunities associated with using PPMs for patterning a 65nm generation first level metal layer of a micro-processor.", "The use of transverse electric (TE) polarization has dominated illumination schemes as selective polarization is used for high-NA patterning. The benefits of TE polarization are clear - the interference of diffracted beams remains absolute at oblique angles. Transverse magnetic (TM) polarization is usually considered less desirable as imaging modulation from interference at large angle falls off rapidly as the 1/cos\u03b8. Significant potential remains, however, for the use of TM polarization at large angles when its reflection component is utilized. By controlling the resist/substrate interface reflectivity, high modulation for TM polarization can be maintained for angles up to 90\u00b0 in the resist. This can potentially impact the design of illumination away from most recent TE-only schemes for oblique imaging angles (high NA). We demonstrate several cases of TM illumination combined with tuned substrate reflectivity for 0.93NA, 1.20NA, and 1.35NA and compare results to TE and unpolarized cases. The goal is to achieve a flat response through polarization at large imaging angles. An additional application of TM illumination is its potential use for double patterning. As double patterning and double exposure approaches are sought in order to meet the needs of 32nm device generations and beyond, materials and process engineering challenges become prohibitive. We have devised a method for frequency doubling in a single exposure using an unconventional means of polarization selection and by making use of the reflective component produced at the photoresist/substrate interface. In doing so, patterns can be deposited into a photoresist film with double density. As an example, using a projection system numerical aperture of 1.20, with water as an immersion fluid, and a conventional polyacrylate 193nm photoresist, pattern resolution at 20nm half-pitch are obtainable (which is 0.125lambda/NA). The process to transfer this geometry into a hardmask layer uses conventional materials, including the photoresist layer and thin film silicon oxide based materials.", "As the industry hits a road block with RETs that attempt to aggressively scale k1, we propose to extend the life of optical lithography by a complete co-optimization between circuit choices, layout patterns and lithography. We demonstrate that the judicious selection of a small number of layout patterns along with the appropriate circuit topologies would not only enable k1 relaxation but also efficient implementation of circuits. Additionally, in this paper, we discuss the use of regular design fabrics to extend the life of current generation lithography equipment. We will introduce the Front End of Line (FEOL) limited regular design fabric. The metal 1 patterns for this fabric are selected such that we can utilize a 1.2 NA 32nm metal 1 lithography process without any area penalty with respect to standard cells with conventional design rules, which require a 32nm metal 1 process with a rather unrealistic k1 of 0.35 while using a more advanced 1.35 NA tool. We also demonstrate simulation results on 2-dimensional layout patterns. The results suggest that smart selection of layout patterns can enable the extension of single exposure lithography to a 32nm production lithography process.", "The imaging of Contact Hole (CH) layouts is one of the most challenging tasks in hyper-NA lithography. Contact Hole layouts can be printed using different illumination conditions, but an illumination condition that provides good imaging at dense pitches (such as Quasar or Quadrupole illumination), will usually suffer from poor image contrast and Depth of Focus (DOF) towards the more isolated pitches. Assist Features (AF) can be used to improve the imaging of more isolated contact holes, but for a random CH layout, an AF placement rule would have to be developed for every CH configuration in the design. This makes optimal AF placement an almost impossible task for random layouts when using rule-based AF placement. We have used an inverse lithography technique by Mentor Graphics, to treat a random contact hole layout (drawn at minimal pitch 115nm) for imaging at NA 1.35. The combination of the dense 115nm pitch and available NA of 1.35 makes the use of Quasar illumination necessary, and the treatment of the clip with inverse lithography automatically generated optimal (model-based) AF for all geometries in the design. Because the inverse lithography solution consists of smooth shapes rather than rectangles, mask manufacturability becomes a concern. The algorithm allows simplification of the smooth shapes into rectangles and greatly improves mask write time. Wafer prints of clips treated with inverse lithography at NA 1.35 confirm the benefit of the assist features.", "We have designed the lithography process for 32nm node logic devices under the 1.3NA single exposure conditions. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the minimum pitches should be determined as 100nm for line pattern and 120nm for contact hole pattern, respectively. The isolated feature needs SRAF to pull up the DOF margin. High density SRAM cell with 0.15um2 area is clearly resolved across exposure and focus window. The 1.3NA scanner has sufficient focus and overlay stability. There is no immersion induced defects.", "Pattern matching methods are examined as fast-CAD tools for full-chip across process window examination of postdecomposition double patterning layouts. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to anticipate lithographic weakness due to many sources. This includes the decomposition strategy itself, OPC of individual sub-layers, focus-exposure process window and illumination. This study is an intermediate step to using fast-CAD assessment tools within pattern decomposition algorithms to guide decisions based on lateral influences instead of rules. The accuracy of the pattern matcher as a method for hot spot detection is investigated, and a model relating coma match factors and edge movement is refined to have an R2 value of 0.95. The validity of the pattern matcher is explored by relating pre-OPC matches to post-OPC matches, and by showing that the lateral influence functions for Z0 and Z3 have high matches at distinct locations, implying that OPC which corrects for one of Z0 and Z3 will not necessarily correct for the other. The pattern matcher is run on a post decomposition layout and locations are identified with high variability under coma, and their sensitivity is verified with aerial image simulations. For one such example, a different split is made and the match factor drops by 55%.", "Double patterning is used to scale designs below k1 factors that can be obtained with single patterning. Because of the double litho and etch steps, however, this is an expensive and time consuming technique. Spacer defined double patterning, which is commonly used to shrink regular dense patterns as used in memory applications, is an expensive technique because of the many deposition and etch steps that are required. In this paper, we propose several alternative process flows which can reduce the cost-of-ownership by eliminating the intermediate etch step in a double litho, double etch for line/space patterns, and replace it by a process step in the track only. These alternative process flows use thermal freezing resist, positive/negative resist and coating a freezing material. For these materials 32nm node logic patterning can be demonstrated, and even 32nm half pitch can be patterned already with one technique. As alternative technique to spacer defined double patterning, dual tone development is proposed, which can generate pitch doubling in resist using a single exposure. Proof-of-concept of this technique is shown experimentally.", "Double patterning based on litho-etch-litho-etch techniques requires the fabrication of small lines or of small spaces after first patterning. If spacer techniques are used for pitch fragmentation small lines are needed as carrier in dense arrays. In any case the CD control is crucial. Focus of this paper is the patterning of small lines with bilayer resist in comparison with single layer resist as pre-requisite for both methods, for various litho conditions. The basic suitability of a bilayer patterning has been demonstrated at k1=0.146 at half pitch of 37.5nm with a sufficient process window and a good CD uniformity after litho and after etch. Single layer resists suffer from pattern collapse and resist thickness loss at defocus if a CD trim by litho \"overexposure\" is applied. This results in deficiency of masking during etch, although the resist profiles and litho process windows look perfect. If a CD trim is achieved by an etch process the CDU is diminished and the minimum patterned space is enlarged compared to bilayer, due the widening by trim etch. The bilayer resist for 193nm dry lithography showed convincing overall performance. First results with 193nm immersion bilayer look also promising but shows grass formation.", "Double patterning (DP) has now become a fixture on the development roadmaps of many device manufacturers for half pitches of 32 nm and beyond. Depending on the device feature, different types of DP and double exposure (DE) are being considered. This paper focuses on the requirements of the most complex forms of DP, pitch splitting, where line density is doubled through two exposures, and sidewall processes, where a deposition process is used to achieve the final pattern. Budgets for CD uniformity and overlay are presented along with tool and process requirements to achieve these budgets. Experimental results showing 45 nm lines and spaces using dry ArF lithography with a k1 factor of 0.20 are presented to highlight some of the challenges. Finally, alternatives to double patterning are presented.", "In June 2007, Intel announced a new pixelated mask technology. This technology was created to address the problem caused by the growing gap between the lithography wavelength and the feature sizes patterned with it. As this gap has increased, the quality of the image has deteriorated. About a decade ago, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) was introduced to bridge this gap, but as this gap continued to increase, one could not rely on the same basic set of techniques to maintain image quality. The computational lithography group at Intel sought to alleviate this problem by experimenting with additional degrees of freedom within the mask. This paper describes the resulting pixelated mask technology, and some of the computational methods used to create it. The first key element of this technology is a thick mask model. We realized very early in the development that, unlike traditional OPC methods, the pixelated mask would require a very accurate thick mask model. Whereas in the traditional methods, one can use the relatively coarse approximations such as the boundary layer method, use of such techniques resulted not just in incorrect sizing of parts of the pattern, but in whole features missing. We built on top of previously published domain decomposition methods, and incorporated limitations of the mask manufacturing process, to create an accurate thick mask model. Several additional computational techniques were invoked to substantially increase the speed of this method to a point that it was feasible for full chip tapeout. A second key element of the computational scheme was the comprehension of mask manufacturability, including the vital issue of the number of colors in the mask. While it is obvious that use of three or more colors will give the best image, one has to be practical about projecting mask manufacturing capabilities for such a complex mask. To circumvent this serious issue, we eventually settled on a two color mask - comprising plain glass and etched glass. In addition, there were several smaller manufacturability concerns, for example a \"1X1\" glass pillar (an isolated 0 phase pixel) were susceptible to collapse under the stress of mask processing, and therefore these had to be constrained out of the final configuration. A third key element was defining the objective function. We experimented with a large number of choices and eventually settled on a form that allows us to trade-off fidelity and contrast. A fourth key element was the optimization algorithm. The number of possible configurations for a trillion pixels present on our final product mask is greater than the number of total elementary particles in the known universe, so finding the proverbial needle in this haystack was difficult to say the least. We chose a mixture of stochastic and direct descent algorithms to find an arrangement that meets the demands. While we have not proved we are close to the absolute global minimum, we conducted several experiments to suggest this is the case. A fifth key element, and a large one at that, was scaling up our software system from micron length scale to centimeter length scale required for full chip tapeout. This software, in turn, has several key components - hierarchy handling, the non-trivial handling of pixelated domain boundaries, repair of regions not converged in terms of image quality, and verification of the entire assembled database. All elements described above were validated through the tapeout of an actual mask to pattern the most complex metal layer for the leading 65nm node microprocessor in high volume manufacturing. This very first experimental tapeout resulted in wafer parts yield comparable to yields on mass produced wafers made with production 65nm technology.", "In this paper, an overview of Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) based on Level Set Methods (LSM) is provided. Applications of ILT in the advanced lithography process are then shown for several different devices, including DRAM, SRAM, FLASH, random logic, and imaging devices. ILT is used to correct the main patterns, as well as automatically insert SRAFs using model-based mathematical methods. The process of SRAF generation in ILT is unified with the process of inversion. With the help of ILT, SRAFs can be inserted where physically needed, independent of source parameters or target patterns. Results that demonstrate the adaptive nature of ILT SRAF insertion capability are presented. Wafer verification results were collected by multiple advanced semiconductor manufacturing companies at advanced technology nodes, including 45nm and 32nm nodes, and compared with their current OPC solution. Final wafer results presented here demonstrate that ILT improves pattern fidelity, enlarges process window, and provides remarkable control for line-end shortening.", "In this paper we introduce a new mask imaging algorithm that is based on the source point integration method (or Abbe method). The method presented here distinguishes itself from existing methods by exploiting the through-focus imaging feature of the Extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) theory of diffraction. An introduction to ENZ-theory and its application in general imaging is provided after which we describe the mask imaging scheme that can be derived from it. The remainder of the paper is devoted to illustrating the advantages of the new method over existing methods (Hopkins-based). To this extent several simulation results are included that illustrate advantages arising from: the accurate incorporation of isolated structures, the rigorous treatment of the object (mask topography) and the fully vectorial through-focus image formation of the ENZ-based algorithm.", "There is a surprising lack of clarity about the exact quantity that a lithographic source map should specify. Under the plausible interpretation that input source maps should tabulate radiance, one will find with standard imaging codes that simulated wafer plane source intensities appear to violate the brightness theorem. The apparent deviation (a cosine factor in the illumination pupil) represents one of many obliquity/inclination factors involved in propagation through the imaging system whose interpretation in the literature is often somewhat obscure, but which have become numerically significant in today's hyper-NA OPC applications. We show that the seeming brightness distortion in the illumination pupil arises because the customary direction-cosine gridding of this aperture yields non-uniform solid-angle subtense in the source pixels. Once the appropriate solid angle factor is included, each entry in the source map becomes proportional to the total |E|^2 that the associated pixel produces on the mask. This quantitative definition of lithographic source distributions is consistent with the plane-wave spectrum approach adopted by litho simulators, in that these simulators essentially propagate |E|^2 along the interfering diffraction orders from the mask input to the resist film. It can be shown using either the rigorous Franz formulation of vector diffraction theory, or an angular spectrum approach, that such an |E|^2 plane-wave weighting will provide the standard inclination factor if the source elements are incoherent and the mask model is accurate. This inclination factor is usually derived from a classical Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, and we show that the nominally discrepant inclination factors used by the various diffraction integrals of this class can all be made to yield the same result as the Franz formula when rigorous mask simulation is employed, and further that these cosine factors have a simple geometrical interpretation. On this basis one can then obtain for the lens as a whole the standard mask-to-wafer obliquity factor used by litho simulators. This obliquity factor is shown to express the brightness invariance theorem, making the simulator's output consistent with the brightness theorem if the source map tabulates the product of radiance and pixel solid angle, as our source definition specifies. We show by experiment that dose-to-clear data can be modeled more accurately when the correct obliquity factor is used.", "The growing importance of mask simulation in a low-k1 realm is matched by an increasing need for numerical methods capable of handling complex 3D configurations. Various approximations applied to physical parameters or boundary conditions allowed a few methods to achieve reasonable run-times. In this work the theoretical foundation and simulation results of an alternative 3D mask modeling method suitable for OPC simulations are presented. We have established the throughput and accuracy of the Coupled-Dipole Simulation Method and have compared results to the rigorous FDTD approach using a test pattern. We will discuss in detail possible approximations needed in order to accelerate the method's performance.", "In this paper, we will outline general mathematical techniques applied to the solution of the inverse problem for partially coherent lithographic imaging. The forward imaging problem is reviewed and its solution is discussed within the framework of 2D sampling and matrix coherence theory. The intensity distribution on the wafer is shown to be a bilinear functional in the sampled mask transmission values, and represents a continuous sparse set of variables for optimization. We review various iterative techniques to optimize the sampled mask transmission, called a tau-map. From the optimal tau-map, a procedure is required to construct a pixelated mask representation with restricted transmission values. This mask representation is not unique since the problem is ill-posed, and leads to multiple mask solutions for a single optimal tau-map. Various procedures based on spectral techniques and principle component analysis to quantize the mask are reviewed.", "In the Hyper-NA immersion lithography regime, the electromagnetic response of the reticle is known to deviate in a complicated manner from the idealized Thin-Mask-like behavior. Already, this is driving certain RET choices, such as the use of polarized illumination and the customization of reticle film stacks. Unfortunately, full 3-D electromagnetic mask simulations are computationally intensive. And while OPC-compatible mask electromagnetic field (EMF) models can offer a reasonable tradeoff between speed and accuracy for full-chip OPC applications, full understanding of these complex physical effects demands higher accuracy. Our paper describes recent advances in leveraging High Performance Computing as a critical step towards lithographic modeling of the full manufacturing process. In this paper, highly accurate full 3-D electromagnetic simulation of very large mask layouts are conducted in parallel with reasonable turnaround time, using a Blue- Gene/L supercomputer and a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) code developed internally within IBM. A 3-D simulation of a large 2-D layout spanning 5\u03bcm\u00d75\u03bcm at the wafer plane (and thus (20\u03bcm\u00d720\u03bcm\u00d70.5\u03bcm at the mask) results in a simulation with roughly 12.5GB of memory (grid size of 10nm at the mask, single-precision computation, about 30 bytes/grid point). FDTD is flexible and easily parallelizable to enable full simulations of such large layout in approximately an hour using one BlueGene/L \"midplane\" containing 512 dual-processor nodes with 256MB of memory per processor. Our scaling studies on BlueGene/L demonstrate that simulations up to 100\u03bcm \u00d7 100\u03bcm at the mask can be computed in a few hours. Finally, we will show that the use of a subcell technique permits accurate simulation of features smaller than the grid discretization, thus improving on the tradeoff between computational complexity and simulation accuracy. We demonstrate the correlation of the real and quadrature components that comprise the Boundary Layer representation of the EMF behavior of a mask blank to intensity measurements of the mask diffraction patterns by an Aerial Image Measurement System (AIMS) with polarized illumination. We also discuss how this model can become a powerful tool for the assessment of the impact to the lithographic process of a mask blank.", "In hyper-NA imaging, the vector properties of the light become important. Therefore, to characterize and to fully exploit the state-of-the-art lithographic apparatus, reconstruction of polarization matrices in the pupil plain of a projection lens has become indispensable. We will present a reconstructed Jones matrix of a benchtest projection optic. The reconstruction method is based on the concept of the first canonical coordinate of the Lie group, which conjures up a geometrical approach. The Jones matrix of this benchtest immersion projection lens is successfully reconstructed using the data obtained by an on-body tool called iPot. A reconstructed polarized wavefront and polarized wavefront measured by iPot agree very well. This newly developed methodology is essential to capturing the nature of light transformations in the hyper-NA projection lenses. It is of fundamental importance to quantifying the properties of the state-of-the-art projection lenses used in lithography.", "Results are presented of mask imaging using the Extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) theory of diffraction. We show that the efficiency of a mask imaging algorithm, derived from this theory, can be increased. By adjusting the basic Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) algorithm, we can calculate the near field of isolated mask structures efficiently, without resorting to periodic domains. In addition, the calculations for the points on the entrance sphere of the imaging system can be done separately with a Fourier transformed Stratton-Chu nearto- far-field transformation. By clever sampling in the radial direction of the entrance pupil, the computational effort is already reduced by at least a factor of 4.", "If RET selection by simulation is to be successful for the deep sub-wavelength technologies of today, then the predictions of the simulator must be quantitatively accurate over the parameter space of interest. The Rigorous Physical resist Model (RPM) within PROLITH and Lithoware is separable from the illumination conditions and the reflection behavior of the wafer stack, and thus should be an excellent candidate for such projects. In this work, the RPM is calibrated for a commercially available ArF photoresist using topdown CD-SEM data, including focus-exposure matrices and CD vs. mask pitch data, under fixed process conditions. It will be shown that this RPM is able to predict the performance of line, trench and contact features, with quantitative accuracy, under different numerical aperture and illumination conditions, even when the wafer stack is altered significantly. The stack alterations include resist thickness change, the presence or absence of an immersion topcoat, substitution of different underlying substrate materials and the use of a single or double layer anti-reflection coating. The resist model accurately describes both the experimental calibration data and two separate experimental validation datasets. The RMS error seen in the extrapolative predictions is comparable to that observed between the model and the original calibration dataset.", "High-refractive-index fluids (HIFs) are being considered to replace water as the immersion fluid in next generation 193nm immersion scanner. We have demonstrated the attractive optical properties for our HIF candidates, HIL-001, HIL-203 and HIL-204. Especially, HIL-203 and HIL-204 have higher transmittance compared to water. In this paper, we describe our latest results on the comparative evaluations including photo-degradation behavior and lens contamination phenomenon in a flow system. For laser induced fluid degradation behavior, it was shown the higher initial transmittance resulted in the higher laser durability. However, the complicated phenomenon was observed for the lens contamination test. That is, HIL-204 with higher initial transmittance showed higher lens contamination rate than HIL-203. From several analyses, the complicated behaviors among HILs were speculated to be caused by the different nature of photo-degraded impurities. In order to control the fluid transmittance change and suppress the lens contamination during exposure, the refining process was definitely necessary for HIL reuse system. Based on the refining mechanism and the refining material design, we have developed an appropriate refinement unit named Refine B. This approach provided us with the result that Refine B could control the change of fluid transmittance and suppress the lens contamination rate.", "High index immersion lithography is one of the candidates for next generation lithography technology following water immersion lithography. This technology may be most attractive for the industry since it is effective in raising resolution without seriously changing the chip making processes. This motivates us to continue to study further NA expansion although there are many challenges with respect to either high index fluid development or high index lens material development. In this paper, the current status of high index lithography development compared with the industry's requirements is discussed while considering design feasibility.", "A two-year study on the feasibility of High-n Immersion Lithography shows very promising results. This paper reports the findings of the study. The evaluation shows the tremendous progress made in the development of second-generation immersion fluid technology. Candidate fluids from several suppliers have been evaluated. All the commercial fluids evaluated are viable, so there are a number of options. Life tests have been conducted on bench top fluid-handling systems and the results referenced to full-scale systems. Parameters such as Dose per Laser Pulse, Pulse Rate, Fluid Flow Rate, and Fluid Absorbency at 193nm, and Oxygen/Air Contamination Levels were explored. A detailed evaluation of phenomena such as Last Lens Element (LLE) contamination has been conducted. Lens cleaning has been evaluated. A comparison of High-n fluid-based technology and water-based immersion technology shows interesting advantages of High-n fluid in the areas of Defect and Resist Interaction. Droplet Drying tests, Resist Staining evaluations, and Resist Contrast impact studies have all been run. Defect-generating mechanisms have been identified and are being eliminated. The lower evaporation rate of the High-n fluids compared with water shows the advantages of High-n Immersion. The core issue for the technology, the availability of High-n optical material for use as the final lens element, is updated. Samples of LuAG material have been received from development partners and have been evaluated. The latest status of optical materials and the technology timelines are reported. The potential impact of the availability of the technology is discussed. Synergy with technologies such as Double Patterning is discussed. The prospects for <22nm (hp) are evaluated.", "A potential extension of water-based 193-nm immersion lithography involves transition to a higher refractive index organic immersion fluid coupled with a higher index last lens element. While considerable progress has been made in improving the photo-durability of the immersion fluid itself, photo-induced contamination of the last lens element caused by laser exposure in the presence of such organic fluids remains a major concern. In this work, we study remediation strategies for such contamination, which would be compatible with conventional lithographic production environments. In general, surface photocontamination layers were found to be highly graphitic in nature, where the first monolayer is strongly bound to the substrate. We have attempted to develop a surface passivation treatment for altering the monolayer chemistry and preventing large-scale contamination, but found such treatments to be unstable under laser irradiation. On the other hand, using hydrogen peroxide as a in-situ cleaning solution has been shown to be extremely effective. We also present first laser-based durability results of LuAG, which is a leading candidate material for high index last element to be used with high index fluids.", "We have performed high-index immersion fluid studies to define the levels of both soluble and insoluble impurities present. These studies have also revealed the importance of process materials' purity in fluid contact. Fluid interactions with resist, leading to both surface and imaging defects, can be minimized by proper resist selection. Our Active Recycle Package technology can greatly extend the useful life of both the fluid itself, as well as the final lens element.", "Volume production of 45nm node devices utilizing Nikon's S610C immersion lithography tool has started. Important to the success in achieving high-yields in volume production with immersion lithography has been defectivity reduction. In this study we evaluate several methods of defectivity reduction. The tools used in our defectivity analysis included a dedicated immersion cluster tools consisting of a Nikon S610C, a volume production immersion exposure tool with NA of 1.3, and a resist coater-developer LITHIUS i+ from TEL. In our initial procedure we evaluated defectivity behavior by comparing on a topcoat-less resist process to a conventional topcoat process. Because of its simplicity the topcoatless resist shows lower defect levels than the topcoat process. In a second study we evaluated the defect reduction by introducing the TEL bevel rinse and pre-immersion bevel cleaning techniques. This technique was shown to successfully reduce the defect levels by reducing the particles at the wafer bevel region. For the third defect reduction method, two types of tool cleaning processes are shown. Finally, we discuss the overall defectivity behavior at the 45nm node. To facilitate an understanding of the root cause of the defects, defect source analysis (DSA) was applied to separate the defects into three classes according to the source of defects. DSA analysis revealed that more than 99% of defects relate to material and process, and less than 1% of the defects relate to the exposure tool. Material and process optimization by collaborative work between exposure tool vendors, track vendors and material vendors is a key for success of 45nm node device manufacturing.", "We evaluate several types of wafers and investigate the effect of wafer edge geometry on focus, dynamics and defectivity performance in ArF immersion lithography. Wafer edge geometry includes both edge shape (e.g. short, long, full round etc.) and edge roll-off (ERO) here. We found that focus accuracy at wafer edge depends on ERO, especially on ZDD (Z double derivative) and if we use the specified wafer which has low ZDD value, it keeps same good focus accuracy at the edge area as the one at the wafer center area. Dynamics (stage synchronization accuracy) was independent of wafer diameter, thickness and edge geometry. We also found that defectivity was strongly dependent on the edge shape. More bridging defects were found on the short edge wafer than the long edge wafer. This is related with wafer edge conditions after coating and during exposure.", "Immersion technology is definitely the mainstream lithography technology for NAND FLASH in recent years since hyper-NA immersion technology drives the resolution limit down to the 40-50 nm half pitch region. Immersion defectivity and overlay issues are key challenges before introducing immersion technology into mass production. In this work, both long term immersion defectivity and overlay data, as well as good photoresist performance, show the Nikon S610C immersion scanner plus LITHIUS i+ cluster is capable of 40-50 nm NAND FLASH mass production. Immersion defects are classified based on their causes, and no tool specific immersion defects, e.g. bubbles and water marks, were found in the Nikon S610C plus TEL LITHIUS i+ cluster. Materials-induced immersion defects require more attention to achieve production-worthy results.", "Water-based immersion technology has overcome various challenges and is starting to be used for the 45nm-node mass production. However, even though immersion technology is being used in memory device production, significant improvement in defect performance is needed before the technology can be used for logic devices. Canon has developed an immersion exposure system, the FPA-7000AS7, with numerical aperture of 1.35. In the AS7 immersion tool, there is little influence of vibration and evaporative cooling. The AS7 has an in-situ cleaning system in order to remove particles carried into the exposure tool. We evaluated the contamination of the projection lens and immersion nozzle due to photoacid generator (PAG) leaching from resist to water. We evaluated the cleaning effects of various cleaning processes and found the suitable processes for cleaning the projection lens and immersion nozzle from the view that it does not adversely affect the exposure tool: damage-free and easy drainage treatment. In addition, we evaluated the influence of particles on the wafer stage, since there is a major concern that particles entering the water may increase the defects. The number of particles adhering on the wafer during an exposure sequence can be reduced with the wafer stage cleaning. Periodical cleaning keeps the wafer stage clean, thus preventing the increase of exposure defects caused by particles. We performed a defect evaluation with the AS7. The average defect density was 0.042/cm2 in the continuous exposure process of 25 wafers with a developer-soluble topcoat. Circle defects and bubble defects were not observed.", "While lithography R&D community at large has already gotten the mind set for 32nm, all eyes are on 22nm node. Current consensus is to employ computational lithography to meet wafer CD uniformity (CDU) requirement. Resolution enhancement technologies (RET) and model OPC are the two fundamental components for computational lithography. Today's full-chip CDU specifications are already pushing physical limits at extreme lithography k1 factor. While increasingly aggressive RET either by double exposure or double patterning are enabling imaging performance, for CDU control we need ever more accurate OPC at a greater computational efficiency. In this report, we discuss the desire for wanting more robust and accurate OPC models. One important trend is to have predictive OPC models allowing accurate OPC results to be obtained much faster, shortening the qualification process for exposure tools. We investigate several key parameters constitute to accuracy achievable in computational lithography. Such as the choice of image pixel size, numbers of terms needed for transmission cross coefficients (TCC), and \"safe\" ambit radius for assuring accurate CD prediction. Selections of image pixel size and \"safe\" ambit radius together determine % utilization for 2D fast Fourier transformation (FFT) for efficient full-chip OPC computation. For IC manufacturing beyond ArF, we made initial observations and estimations on EUV computational lithography. These discussions pave the way for developing a computational lithography roadmap extends to the end of Moore's Law. This computational lithography roadmap aims to be a complement for the current ITRS roadmap on what does it take to achieve CD correction accuracy.", "Production optical proximity correction (OPC) tools employ compact optical models in order to accurately predict complicated optical lithography systems with good theoretical accuracy. Theoretical accuracy is not the same as usable prediction accuracy in a real lithographic imaging system. Real lithographic systems have deviations from ideal behavior in the process, illumination, projection and mechanical systems as well as in metrology. The deviations from the ideal are small but non-negligible. For this study we use realistic process variations and scanner values to perform a detailed study of useful OPC model accuracy vs. the variation from ideal behavior and vs. theoretical OPC accuracy. The study is performed for different 32nm lithographic processes. The results clearly show that incorporating realistic process, metrology and imaging tool signatures is significantly more important to predictive accuracy than small improvements in theoretical accuracy.", "A new method for the simulation of diffraction limited images is presented that is suitable for application in optical proximity correction and verification, where fast execution is critical. The method is given the name hybrid Hopkins-Abbe, because it is literally a hybrid of Hopkins' and Abbe's diffraction theories. The hybrid Hopkin--Abbe method resolves the problem of the traditional Hopkins theory, namely the requirement for constant mask diffraction efficiencies. Simulation of electromagnetic scattering from the mask that takes into account the oblique angles of incidence from the illumination is performed by application of the domain decomposition method that is extended for offaxis illumination. Examples of 45nm and 32nm lines and spaces through pitch and through focus are presented to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the hybrid Hopkins-Abbe method. The results obtained are in excellent agreement with a rigorous and independent (third party) simulator. Other aspects of hybrid Hopkins-Abbe method relevant to OPC application are also discussed.", "Robust optical proximity correction (OPC) and design for manufacturability (DFM) methodology for optical variation among exposure tools is proposed. It is demonstrated that application of the methodology improves standard deviation of CD difference for target CD by 33% compared with the case of using the conventional methodology. Under the low-k1 lithography condition, hot spots induced by optical variation among exposure tools delay ramp-up of production of high-volume products. To realize robust pattern formation for all exposure tools, the following new methodologies are introduced : i) OPC modeling methodology using actual optics of primary tool, ii) OPC processing methodology using averaged or designed optics, iii) at the design stage, hot spot detection within the optical variation space centered on average or designed optics and hot spot fixing by layout modification or OPC optimization, iv) at the manufacturing stage, hot spot detection using actual optics and hot spot fixing by optical adjustment of troubled tool.", "Pixelated phase masks rendered from computational lithography techniques demand one generation-ahead mask technology development. In this paper, we reveal the accomplishment of fabricating Cr-less, full field, defect-free pixilated phase masks, including integration of tapeout, front-end patterning and backend defect inspection, repair, disposition and clean. This work was part of a comprehensive program within Intel which demonstrated microprocessor device yield. To pattern mask pixels with lateral sizes <100nm and vertical depth of 170nm, tapeout data management, ebeam write time management, aggressive pattern resolution scaling, etch improvement, new tool insertion and process integration were co-optimized to ensure good linearity of lateral, vertical dimensions and sidewall angle of glass pixels of arbitrary pixelated layout, including singlets, doublets, triplets, touch-corners and larger scale features of structural tones including pit/trench and pillar/mesa. The final residual systematic mask patterning imperfections were corrected and integrated upstream in the optical model and design layout. The volume of 100nm phase pixels on a full field reticle is on the order tera-scale magnitude. Multiple breakthroughs in backend mask technology were required to achieve a defect free full field mask. Specifically, integration of aerial image-based defect inspection, 3D optical model-based high resolution ebeam repair and disposition were introduced. Significant reduction of pixel mask specific defect modes, such as electro static discharge and glass pattern collapse, were executed to drive defect level down to single digit before attempt of repair. The defect printability and repair yield were verified downstream through silicon wafer print test to validate defect free mask performance.", "In this paper advanced OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) methods, additional with assistant features, and non-obvious methods were implemented to correct aberrations caused by aggressive illuminations in order to optimize the shape of the finger tips. OPC model and simulations were verified using 2D verification method.", "In the Hyper-NA immersion age, it is essential to optimize all optical parameters, and so exposure tools must have functions to precisely control the parameters. There have been various reports indicating that polarization aberrations of projection optics affect imaging performance, but there have been few reports on reducing their influence in tools. We have developed a new method to optimize imaging performance with polarization taken into account. This paper describes a theoretical analysis of polarization with Pauli decomposition. A strict vectorial calculation of optical images matches our expression. Then, our solver software can determine the optimum conditions of all aberration parameters of exposure tools for specific IC patterns.", "To determine the magnitude of the exposure latitude required for a process to be manufacturable, additional factors are considered that have a similar relationship between linewidth variation and image log-slope. Such parameters include resist thickness, flare, post-exposure bake temperature, and line-edge roughness. To obtain consistency between theory and experiment it is necessary to use the resist-edge log-slope generalization of image log-slope. Inclusion of these additional factors increases the required exposure latitude five to six times more than would be considered necessary from exposure tool dose control alone.", "A theoretical analysis to estimate the effect of shot noise on CDU is induced from optical imaging perspectives combined with quantum theory, and is studied for 193-nm, EUV, and electron beam lithography. We found the CDU variation from shot noise is related to the number of particles absorbed in the printed area and to the image log slope (ILS). Hence, the CDU variation contributed by shot noise gets worse when the technology node advances from 45- to 32-, 22-, and 15-nm, EUV with higher ILS is no exception. For e-beam lithography, we are interested in the values of ILS calculated from array structures with different pitches, backscattering, wafer-stage movement, and raster-scan writing.", "Depth of Focus (DOF) and exposure latitude requirements have long been ambiguous. Techniques range from scaling values from previous generations to summing individual components from the scanner. Even more ambiguous is what critical dimension (CD) variation can be allowed to originate from dose and focus variation. In this paper we discuss a comprehensive approach to measuring focus variation that a process must be capable of handling. We also describe a detailed methodology to determine how much CD variation can come from dose and focus variation. This includes examples of the statistics used to combine individual components of CD, dose and focus variation.", "This paper examines the extendibility of the scatterometry techniques to characterize structures pushing the limits of current lithographic printing technologies. In particular, we investigate the limits of normal-incidence optical CD (NIOCD) measurements using the smallest features afforded by the most recent generation of hyper-NA immersion scanners. Special analysis techniques have also been developed and applied to cases relevant to double exposure and double patterning lithography. Models were used successfully to decouple CD and overlay values associated with patterning the first and second set of features on the wafer, using a single scatterometry measurement. These advances pave the way to the development of full solutions for the general case of double patterning structures with two different populations of lines or structures. In addition, the current study focused on seeking a better understanding of the use of scatterometry 3D features characterization, particularly as it relates to OPC model building and verification. The demonstration of tip-to-tip measurements on 3D structures is very encouraging as it introduces the advantages of scatterometry, such as reduced influence of line-edge roughness (LER) and better precision, to the practice of advanced OPC model building.", "Nikon's production immersion scanners, including the NSR-S609B and the NSR-S610C, have now been in the field for over 2 years. With these tools, 55 nm NAND Flash processes became the first immersion production chips in the world, and 45 nm NAND Flash process development and early production has begun. Several logic processes have also been developed on these tools. This paper discusses the technical features of Nikon's immersion tools, and their results in production.", "Canon has developed an immersion exposure tool, the FPA-7000AS7 (AS7), with the industry's highest NA of 1.35. This paper reports on its performance. The AS7's projection lens achieves ultra-low aberration with total RMS of less than 5 m\u03bb and flare of less than 0.5%. The resolution capability is 37 nm with k1 = 0.259, and DOF of 0.8 \u03bcm was obtained owing to the ultra-low aberration and low flare. Regarding focus performance, a 3\u03c3 value of 19.3 nm for Lstage and 16.1nm for R-stage were attained in a whole area. The result of CD uniformity of 1.91nm (3\u03c3) was obtained across the wafer with a total of 4032 measurement points. Distortion was 3.9 nm at the worst value. On the other hand the most critical issue of immersion is defects, so the nozzle, lens and stage must be cleaned to reduce defects. The result of defect evaluation of the AS7 was an average of 0.042 defect/cm2 from 25 wafers in a lot and average 0.046 defect count/cm2 from long-term defect evaluation for two months. From these results, we are confident that the AS7 is capable of 45-nm node device production.", "Immersion lithography has been developed in a tremendous pace. Starting in late 2001, the technology now has moved to volume production of advanced flash memories. The immersion exposure system has been the key enabler in this progress. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the TWINSCAN immersion scanning exposure tools, and present an overview of its performance on imaging, lens heating control, overlay, focus and defects. It is shown that stable performance assures 45-nm device volume manufacturing. Extendibility of immersion towards 38-nm and 32-nm is discussed. For NAND the next device half pitch will be around 38-nm and it is shown that with 1.35 NA and low k1 dipole or CQUAD illumination a final extension with single exposure is possible. For the 32-nm node and beyond double patterning methods are required till EUV lithography is ready to be used in volume production. To secure tight CD tolerance the overlay performance of the immersion tools need to be tightened to numbers well below 3-nm. The paper presents overlay improvements towards the requirements for double patterning.", "IC manufacturers have a strong demand for transferring a working process from one scanner to another. In an ideal transfer, a reticle set that produces devices within specification on a certain scanner has the same performance on another exposure tool. In real life, however, reticles employ optical proximity correction (OPC) which incorporates by definition the inherent optical fingerprint of a specific exposure tool and process. In order to avoid the additional cost of developing a new OPC model and acquiring a new reticle for each exposure tool, IC manufacturers therefore wish to \"match\" the optical fingerprint of their scanners as closely as possible. In this paper, we report on the matching strategy that we developed to perform a tool-to-tool matching. We present experimental matching results for several tool combinations at numerical apertures (NA) 0.75, 0.85 and 1.2. Matching of two exposure tools is obtained by determining the sensitivities to scanner parameter variations like NA, Sigma, Focus Drilling, Ellipticity and Dose from wafer data and/or simulations. These sensitivities are used to calculate the optimal scanner parameters for matching the two tools.", "Double patterning (DP) lithography is expected to be deployed at the 32nm node to enable the extension of high NA (\u22651.3) scanner systems currently used for 45nm technology. Increasing the light source power is one approach to address the intrinsically lower throughput that DP imposes. Improved energy stability also provides a means to improve throughput by enabling fewer pulses per exposure slit window, which in turn enables the use of higher scanner stage speeds. Current excimer laser light sources for deep UV immersion lithography are operating with powers as high as 60W at 6 kHz repetition rates. In this paper, we describe the introduction of the XLR 600i, a 6 kHz excimer laser that produces 90W power, based on a recirculating ring technology. Improved energy stability is inherent to the ring technology. Key to the successful acceptance of such a higher power, or higher energy laser is the ability to reduce operating costs. For this reason, the recirculating ring technology provides some unique advantages that cannot be realized with conventional excimer lasers today. Longer intrinsic pulse durations that develop in the multi-pass ring architecture reduce the peak power that the optics are subjected to, thereby improving lifetime. The ring architecture also improves beam uniformity that results in a significantly reduced peak energy density, another key factor in preserving optics lifetime within the laser as well as in the scanner. Furthermore, in a drive to reduce operating costs while providing advanced technical capability, the XLR 600i includes an advanced gas control management system that extends the time between gas refills by a factor of ten, offering a significant improvement in productive time. Finally, the XLR 600i provides a novel bandwidth stability control system that reduces variability to provide better CD control, which results in higher wafer yields.", "The k1 factor continues to be driven downwards, even beyond its theoretical limit 0.25, in order to enable the 32 nm feature generation and beyond. Due to the extremely small process-window that will be available for such extremely demanding imaging challenges, it is necessary that not only each unit contributing to the imaging system be driven to its ultimate performance capability, but also that the final integrated imaging system apply each of the different components in an optimum way with respect to one another, and maintain that optimum performance level and cooperation at all times. Components included in such an integrated imaging system include the projection lens, illumination optics, light source, in-situ metrology tooling, aberration control, and dose control. In this paper we are going to discuss the required functions of each component of the imaging system and how to optimally control each unit in cooperation with the others in order to achieve the goal of 32 nm patterning and beyond.", "Ellipsometry is defined as a technique for determining the properties of a bulk material or a thin film, such as optical index and thickness, from the measurement of a polarization state of a reflected light or a change of polarization states between the incident and reflected lights. On the other hand, polarimetry is defined as a technique for determining a polarization state of a light. In other words, ellipsometry uses polarization as a probe and polarimetry measures polarization itself. We have constructed a theory of polarimetry of illumination used in lithography equipments, fabricated a polarimeter mask, and demonstrated it for a hyper-NA (numerical aperture) immersion lithography scanner. The polarimeter mask comprises polarizers and quarter-wave (\u03bb/4) plates that are crammed into a narrow space with a height of 6.35 mm. The thin plate polarizers available at a wavelength of 193 nm are made of calcite, and the \u03bb/4-plates insensitive to angle of incidence are made of four thin plates, two of which are crystalline quartz; the other two are sapphire. A light traveling through a window of the polarimeter mask reaches an image detector at the wafer level through projection optics. Stokes parameters of the illumination light can be measured without any influence from polarization characteristics of the projection optics between the mask and the image detector.", "Optical lithography has had great success in recent history in utilizing the most advanced optical technology to create NA=1.35 immersion lenses. These lenses have aberration levels at or below the 5m level. Much of this is due to advancements in lens design, materials, and aspheric polishing techniques. Now that the lenses are nearly \"perfect\", more attention is being given to the illuminator and its performance. This paper examines the fundamental metrics that are used to analyze the illumination source shape as it pertains to the optical proximity effect (OPE). It is found that the more traditional metric of partial coherence, \u03c3, is often not sufficient to explain through pitch CD performance. Metrics are introduced to compare multiple sources and compared to their correlation to OPE with respect to a reference. A new parametric model for annular illumination is introduced and shown to correlate within an RMS=0.03nm of the OPE data.", "In order to respond to the constant demand for more productivity in the manufacture of IC devices, higher throughput and higher resolution are fundamental requirements for each new generation of exposure tools. However, meeting both requirements lead to unwanted aberration we refer to as \"thermal aberration\". In our experience, the problem of the thermal aberrations does not correlated only to the duration of heavy use. It depends very strongly on both the optical settings and the mask patterns, also even on the specific interaction between the two. So, even if using the same illumination configurations, there is a possibility to observe different distribution of thermal aberrations. In this paper, we define and investigate various patterns to be used as targets for thermal aberrations compensation. These patterns are identified as the \"weak patterns\" of the thermal aberration. We assess several cases of thermal aberrations, and show how the optimized compensation for each is determined and then applied on the actual exposure tools.", "The introduction of lithographic systems with NA=1.35 has enabled the extension of optical lithography to 45 nm and below. At the same time, despite the larger NA, k1-factors have dropped to 0.3 and below. Defining the appropriate strategies for these high-end lithographic processes requires the integration and co-optimization of the design, mask and imaging parameters. This requires an in-depth understanding of the relevant parameters for imaging performance during high volume manufacturing. Besides the Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU) budget for the baseline lithographic system, it is crucial to realize that system performance may vary over time in volume manufacturing. In this paper the CDU budget will be restated, with all the well-known contributors, and extended with some new terms, such as volume manufacturing effects. Experimental low-k1 results will be shown from NA=1.35 lithographic tools and compared to model-based predictions under realistic volume manufacturing circumstances. The combination of extreme NA and low k1 makes it necessary to introduce computational lithography for scanner optimization. The potential of using LithoCruiserTM and TachyonTM for optimising scanner source and OPC will be described. Also, using the fast scanner correction mechanisms to compensate for reticle, track and etch fingerprints and variations will be discussed.", "This paper will provide experimental results of Phase-Shift Mask (PSM) Polarimetry, a previously introduced resistbased polarization monitoring technique that employs a specialized chromeless phase-shifting test reticle. The patterns derived from high-NA proximity effects have proven to be 2 to 3 times more sensitive to polarization than a previously reported generation of patterns. Example results in this paper show that for a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.93, this technique is likely capable of measuring the intensity in the preferred polarization state (IPS) to within about 3%. Data from a follow-on reticle for NAs up to 1.35 is expected soon and promises to measure IPS to within about 1.5%. This is expected to suffice for monitoring polarization at the 22nm node for water-based immersion tools over time or from tool to tool. This technique is extendable and likely offers even greater sensitivity for high-index immersion lithography, should NAs greater than 1.35 become available. Advantages and disadvantages of this technique will be addressed.", "In this study, DP (Double Patterning) and DPS (Double Patterning with Spacer) were comprehensively compared through word line layout of 50nm node product, and special focus was put on the assessments of layout discontinuity zones through experimental validation. In conventional flash manufacturing, the lithographic proximity effect and etch loading effect around the array-gap zones have been inherent characteristics to be addressed. For DP process, apart from the overlay error induced pattern displacement and CD non-uniformity, the cross-coupling effects between adjacent features around the array-gap zones by two photo and two etch steps have further complicated the process optimization, therefore careful exploration was carried out to indicate the challenges on process optimization. The DPS can maintain good resultant CD uniformity of dense array through precisely programmed exposure CD and spacer thickness, it may also keep away from the proximity around array-gap zones. But, the second exposure is necessary for trimming the unwanted patterns and delineating the peripheral patterns. In purpose of trimming the unwanted patterns at array-gap zone in the 2nd exposure, the overlay registration will account for the CD control of boundary lines as well as the defectivity around this area.", "In this paper we investigate the process margin for the 100nm half - pitch double exposure KrF lithography using binary masks for different illumination settings. The application of Double Exposure Lithography (DEL) would enlarge the capability of 248 nm exposure technique to smaller pitch e.g. for the integration of dedicated layers into 0.13 \u03bcm BiCMOS with critical dimension (CD) requirements exceeding the standard 248 nm lithography specification. The DEL was carried out with a KrF Scanner (Nikon S207D, NALens = 0.82) for a critical dimension (CD) of 100nm half pitch. The chemical amplified positive resists SL4800 or UV2000 (Rohm & Haas) with a thickness of 325nm were coated on a 70 nm AR10L (Rohm & Haas) bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC). With a single exposure and using binary masks it is not possible to resolve 100nm lines with a pitch of 200 nm, due to the refraction and the resolution limit. First we investigated the effect of focus variation. It is shown that the focus difference of 1st and 2nd exposure is one critical parameter of the DEL. This requires a good focus repeatability of the scanner. The depth of focus (DOF) of 360 nm with the coherence parameter \u03c3 = 0.4 was achieved for DEL with SL4800 resist. The influence of the better resist resolution of UV2000 on the process window will be shown (DOF = 460 nm). If we change the focus of one of the exposures the CD and DOF performance of spaces is reduced with simultaneous line position changing. Second we investigated the effect of different illumination shapes and settings. The results for conventional illumination with different values for \u03c3 and annular illumination with \u03c3inner = 0.57 and \u03c3outer = 0.85 will be shown. In summary, the results show that DEL has the potential to be a practical lithography enhancement method for device fabrication using high NA KrF tool generation.", "A new technology called the double patterning (DP) process with ArF immersion lithography is one of the candidate fabrication technologies for 32 nm-node devices. Over the past few years, many studies have been conducted on techniques for the DP process. Among these technologies, we thought that the double Si hard mask (HM) process is the most applicable technology from the viewpoint of high technical applicability to 32 nm-node device fabrication. However, this process has a disadvantage in the cost performance compared with other DP technologies since these HMs are formed by the chemical vacuum deposition (CVD) method. In this paper, we studied the DP process using a dual spin-on Si containing layer without using the CVD method to improve process cost and process applicability. Perhydropolysilazane (PSZ) was used as one of the middle layers (MLs). PSZ changes to SiO2 through the reaction with water by the catalytic action of amine in the baking step. Using PSZ and Si-BARC as MLs, we succeeded in making a fine pattern by this novel DP technique. In this paper, the issues and countermeasures of the double HM technique using spin-on Si containing layers will be reported.", "Double patterning technique is listed as the top option for 32nm technology nodes at recently updated 2007 International Technology Roadmap Semiconductor (ITRS). Double patterning (DP) effectively reduces the k1 factor to less than 0.25, however, various process challenges, including critical dimension uniformity (CDU), line edge and line width roughnesses (LER/LWR), and overlay, have to come up with solutions for the industry in device manufacturing. In this study, we developed a metal hard mask and a universal dual hard mask double patterning process and demonstrated 45nm half-pitch in dark field patterning and 32nm half pitch in bright field applications by using a 0.93NA 193nm dry scanner system. By using the optimized hard mask films and Applied Materials' Advanced Patterning Film (APFTM) as a bottom hard mask, the universal dual hard mask double patterning scheme shows significant improvement in line edge roughness and line width roughness, achieved best results of 2nm LER and 2.5nm LWR at APF hard mask.", "As the VLSI technology scales into deep submicron nodes, Double Patterning Technology (DPT) has shown its necessity for the under 45nm processes. However, the litho-related and process-related issues, such as the overlay control for CD uniformity, decomposition, feature stitching technology and some other problems make up the main challenges for the implementation of DPT. Due to Optical Proximity Correction (OPC), the complexity and data volume of DPT increase dramatically, which severely increase the application cost and create manufacturability problems. In this paper, we mainly talk about the interactions between DPT and OPC and propose a new Model-Based OPC methods for the decomposition in DPT procedures. To address the printing problems with cutting sites for feature split, we introduce an overlap correction method on the stitching locations. For any re-cut and/or redesigned pattern after verification, we categorize DP decompositions and introduce a new Adaptable OPC (Ad-OPC) algorithm by reusing post OPC layout to speed up the correction and improve its convergence according to environment surrounding. The method can be easily incorporated into existing MB-OPC framework. To test this method, total Edge Placement Error (EPE) and runtime are calculated in our experiments. Results show that over 90% runtime can be saved compared with conventional OPC procedure. It increases the robustness and friendliness of pattern correction as well as stitches features back satisfactorily.", "There has been an ongoing request to make semiconductor devices smaller and smaller. The cellblock size of SRAM is predominated by both a gate-to-contact space and a poly-to-poly space. The gate-to-contact space is defined by the leakage value from the poly electrode. So we focused on the poly-to-poly space for all shrinkage. We have been studying connected line splitting techniques. We named it ELS (end of line splitting) technology. A critical issue is to control gaps between two narrow gate-poly's line-ends or between a narrow gatepoly's line-end and a neighboring wire-poly line due to lower contrast in low-k1 lithography. In the case of standard cells, especially, the patterning of narrow gate-poly projected to wire-poly is easy to shorten. To prevent this electrical short, designers avoid keeping a narrow gap and small chip size. In order to realize a narrower gap, a splitting technique, well-known and adopted in poly's line-ends of SRAM that are regularly arrayed, is effective. We are investigating how to extend this technique as ELS technology for random logic of poly toward creating a 32-nm node. In this paper, the authors focus on the following topics: 1) data preparation technique, and 2) experimental results. Then this technology for the poly layer of random logic LSI devices is compared with result of conventional single exposure and double pattering technology. In addition, the result that overlay control issue for ELS technology is not severe compared with pitch doubling technology is described. ELS technology can help the designer and our lithographer to reduce the gap and reduce the array grid size of standard cells.", "Recently, in order to increase the number of transistors in wafer by small feature size, optical lithography has been changed to low wavelength from 365nm to 193nm and high NA of 0.93. And further wavelength is aggressively shifting to 13.5nm for more small feature size, i.e., Extreme Ultra Violet Lithography(EUVL), a kind of Next Generation Lithography(NGL)1. And other technologies are developed such as water immersion(193nm) and photo resist Double Patterning(DP). Immersion lens system has high NA up to 1.3 due to high n of water(n=1.44 at 193nm), the parameter k1 is process constant, but 0.25 is a tough limit at a equal line and space, if we use immersion lens with 193nm wavelength than limit of resolution is 37nm. Especially, Double Exposure Technique(DET) process is widely studied because of the resolution enhancement ability using a same material and machine, despite of process complication. And SADP(Self Aligned Double Patten) is newly researched for overlay and LER(Line Edge Roughness) enhancement. In this paper, we illustrate the feasibility of the shift double pattern for 65nm-node flash using a 193nm light dipole source and the possibility of decrease minimum feature size using a property of silicon shrinkage during thermal oxidation process.", "We have successfully developed a self-limiting chemical dry etch process, associated equipment, and process flow featuring no use of plasma and no mask bending. In this process and process flow, the system performs mask trimming for critical dimension (CD) adjustments after hard-mask formation. First, the CD as defined in lithography is directly transferred by reactive ion etching (RIE) to silicon oxide film that is to become the hard mask. Next, reactive gas is deposited on the surface of the silicon oxide film at low temperatures and the reaction product is evaporated at high temperatures. With this process flow, there is no need to trim a mask made of organic materials. As a result, there is no mask bending and the amount of hard-mask trimming can be set by the amount of gas flow and pressure in the chemical dry etch process enabling detailed CD control to be performed. The proposed technology means that even higher aspect ratios in masks and finer CD control can be achieved for processes such as double patterning (DP) and sidewall transfer (SWT).", "We have developed a cost-effective critical dimension (CD) shrink technique that allows all-in-one processing of CD shrinking, BARC etching, hard mask etching, and resist stripping in a reactive ion etcher (RIE) for the double patterning (DP) required in the formation of contact and via hole masks with the most critical exposure margins. This CD shrink technique was successfully applied to achieve a CD shrinkage of 60 nm and a CD uniformity of within 3 nm at 3 sigma over the wafer surface. We also determined that the CD shrink technique that employs RIE differs from CD shrink by resolution enhancement lithography assisted by chemical shrink (RELACS) [1] and low-temperature molecular layer deposition (MLD) in having an effect of expanding the lithography process window. We successfully applied our technique to form a 30-nm CD hole pattern with a duty ratio of 1:1.", "Double patterning is the best technique which allows 193nm immersion lithography to anticipate the 32 nm node, before EUV lithography. The final device pattern is formed by two independent patterning steps where the dense pitch is doubled. This allows printing each patterning step with higher k1 imaging factor. In this paper we present the overlay and CD budget applied to a double patterning (DP) technique for the definition of a 32nm technology node device, using an immersion scanner tool. A balance among different factors which affects the final CD of the device is necessary to optimize the imaging and the alignment performances of the exposure tool. A preliminary activity is also necessary to choose the most suitable mask splitting strategy. Adopting a single mask, which is exposed twice with the appropriate shift - the final pitch - , makes the overlay between the two exposures less critical than splitting the complementary layouts on two different masks. Finally, the CD uniformity of the pooled distributions from the two exposures is evaluated in order to define the requested tool performances in terms of overlay, CD control and metrology.", "As SRAM arrays become lithographically more aggressive than random logic, they are more and more determining the lithography processes used. High yielding, low leakage, dense SRAM cells demand fairly aggressive lithographic process conditions. This leads to a borderline process window for logic devices. The tradeoff obtained between process window optimization for random logic gates and dense SRAM is not always straightforward, and sometimes necessitates design rule and layout modifications. By delinking patterning of the logic devices from SRAM, one can optimize the patterning processes for these devices independently. This can be achieved by a special double patterning technique that employs a combination of double exposure and double etch (DE2). In this paper we show how a DE2 patterning process can be employed to pattern dense SRAM cells in the 45nm node on fully integrated wafers, with more than adequate overlap of gate line-end onto active area. We have demonstrated that this process has adequate process window for sustainable manufacturing. For comparison purpose we also demonstrate a single exposure single etch solution to treat such dense SRAM cells. In 45nm node, the dense SRAM cell can also be printed with adequate tolerances and process window with single expose (SE) with optimized OPC. This is confirmed by electrical results on wafer. We conclude that DE2 offers an attractive alternative solution to pattern dense SRAM in 45nm and show such a scheme can be extended to 32nm and beyond. Employing DE2 lets designers migrate to very small tip-to-tip distance in SRAM. The selection of DE2 or SE depends on layout, device performance requirements, integration schemes and cost of ownership.", "The current optical photolithography technology is approaching the physical barrier to the minimum achievable feature size. To produce smaller devices, new resolution enhancement technologies must be developed. Double exposure lithography has shown promise as potential pathway that is attractive because it is much cheaper than double patterning lithography and it can be deployed on existing imaging tools. However, this technology is not possible without the development of new materials with nonlinear response to exposure dose. The performance of existing materials such as reversible contrast enhancement layers (rCELs) and theoretical materials such as intermediate state two-photon (ISTP) and optical threshold layer (OTL) materials in double exposure applications was investigated through computer simulation. All three materials yielded process windows in double exposure mode. OTL materials showed the largest process window (DOF 0.137 \u03bcm, EL 5.06 %). ISTP materials had the next largest process window (DOF 0.124 \u03bcm, EL 3.22 %) followed by the rCEL (0.105 \u03bcm, 0.58 %). This study is an analysis of the feasibility of using the materials in double exposure mode.", "Argon ion implantation has been investigated as a means of achieving resist stabilization, such that a second resist layer may be patterned without attacking the 1st layer. The viability of such an approach has been investigated for double printing. Potential benefits include resist feature shrinkage and Line Width Roughness (LWR) improvements. Line shrinkage benefits the lithographic process window as features can be printed larger, while improvements in LWR, is a further valuable attribute. We report on the role played by ion implant dose, its impact on both lateral and vertical resist shrinkage, LWR as well as its impact on organic BARC reflectivity. The performance of such masks during dry etching of a gate layer has been additionally evaluated.", "Double patterning lithography appears a likely candidate to bridge the gap between water-based immersion lithography and EUV. A double patterning process is discussed for 30nm half-pitch interconnect structures, using 1.2 NA immersion lithography combined with the MotifTM CD shrink technique. An adjusted OPC calculation is required to model the proximity effects of the Motif shrink technique and subsequent metal hard mask (MHM) etch, on top of the lithography based proximity effects. The litho-etch-litho-etch approach is selected to pattern a TiN metal hard mask. This mask is then used to etch the low-k dielectric. The various process steps and challenges encountered are discussed, with the feasibility of this approach demonstrated by successfully transferring a 30nm half-pitch pattern into the MHM.", "With 32nm and 22nm feature size node in the near future, Double patterning type processing will be in mainstream device manufacturing in most cutting edge Fabrication facilities. These type of processes requires cooperation between the litho cell and the other processing modules. In a collaboration between ASML and TEL we have developed a integrated solution to image 30nm Contacts. We describe a novel technique to achieve a geometric shrink from a starting geometry of 65nm down to the final feature size of 30nm for each of the two contact images Processing 2 images separately could produce two distinct populations for alignment and critical dimensions. We will show the ability to image 65nm contacts on a 130nm pitch with acceptable process windows and then apply the novel CD shrink process to shrink the 65nm contacts to 30nm final dimension. The second level of contacts is imaged in between the 1st set of contacts allowing us to image a 32nm \u00bd pitch contact pattern. We show the ability to Image 2 separate sets of contacts using a split clip layout with a single distribution for critical output parameters. We address the following process challenges: 1) Overlay capability across the slit and across the field. 2) Critical Dimension capability across the slit and across the Field. 3) Sidewall angle integrity with acceptable process window. Using the novel CD shrink process TEL has developed and imaging capability of the an ASML 1700i TWINSCAN, we can achieve a double pattern contact process with acceptable process capability.", "A hyper-NA lithography tool is used in production of the latest devices. In the next generation immersion lithography, issues that had so for neglected had to be considered because NA of illumination optics is larger than conventional tools. Here, items were listed up for accurate prediction of imaging by optical simulation. These were transmittance of illumination rays to the mask, mask induced effects such as polarization and aberration, and pellicle induced effect. These were depending on incident angle. Therefore consideration of angle dependency of these effects was necessary for more accurate imaging simulation. We presented the requirements for simulation to facilitate discussion of the imaging performance of below 40 nm hp pattern node immersion lithography.", "When projected with a scanner, the latent image intensity in the photoresist has a slope that can be much lower than with an interferometer. To study finely the lithographic process and to be predictive, the Normalized image slope of 193 nm immersion interferometer built at LETI has to be controlled. The exposure latitude (EL), the Normalized Image Log Slope (NILS) and the interference contrast are closely related.", "ArF water immersion systems with a numerical aperture (NA) of over 1.3 have already introduced for the node up to 45- nm half-pitch production. For the next generation of lithography, we focus on ArF immersion lithography using high-index materials. At present, LuAG (n=2.14) is the most promising candidate as a high-index lens material. Second-generation fluids (n=1.64) have the sufficient performance as a high-index immersion fluid. The combination of LuAG and a second-generation fluid can enhance the NA up to 1.55 and the exposure system would be available for the 34-nm half-pitch node when k1 is 0.27. Although high-index immersion lithography is attractive since it is effective in raising resolution, there are some issues not encountered in water immersion system. The issues of LuAG are its availability and the intrinsic birefringence. Fluid degradation induced by dissolved oxygen or laser irradiation, lens contamination, and residual fluid on a wafer are the specific issues of the immersion system. In this article, we introduce the current status for the above issues and discuss the feasibility of ArF immersion system using high-index materials.", "The practical extendibility of immersion lithography to the 32nm and 22nm nodes is being supported on immersion microsteppers installed at SEMATECH in Albany, New York. As the industry pushes the limits of water-based immersion technologies, research has continued into developing alternative materials to extend optical lithography for upcoming device generations. High index materials have been the primary focus of investigation, including optical lens materials such as lutetium aluminum garnet (LuAG with n=2.14) and barium lithium fluoride (BaLiF3 with n=1.64), high index fluids (Gen 2 and Gen 3 with n>=1.64), and resists. On a parallel and potentially complementary path, double patterning and double exposure technologies have been proposed. For high index materials research, the Amphibian XIS has demonstrated imaging at 1.50NA (32nm half-pitch) with high index fluids. A prism module is also available to enable imaging with potential BaLiF3 and LuAG prisms. The Exitech MS193i has demonstrated performance and imaging capability at 38nm hp with k1=0.256 at 1.30NA. Modifications at the mask plane now provide a double exposure capability, offering an imaging platform to investigate experimental classes of nonlinear materials and enabling double exposure imaging below k1eff=0.25. In this paper, we will discuss recent developments in these research areas supported by the toolset at SEMATECH.", "Optical lithography in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) region is being pushed to reach the limits of printing resolution. The effort required to achieve the 32 nm structure with this technology puts very hard conditions and requests on the illumination optics. Different kinds of illumination modes are combined to get into a regime of extreme numerical aperture (hyper NA). Arrays of refractive micro-optics have been and continue to be the ideal solution for high transmission homogenizing elements for several tool generations. Illumination of the masks with high numerical aperture is critical for achieving the smallest structure on the semiconductor material. Exposure tools use different illumination modes to get better imaging of certain mask structures. The beam shaping necessary to create these illumination modes is achieved mostly with diffractive elements. Most of the currently used modes can also be created with arrays of refractive micro-optics, manufactured from fused silica and calcium fluoride. The advantage over the diffractive optical elements lies in efficiency, which comes close to 90%. An important prerequisite for these special types of optical elements is LIMO's unique production technology which can manufacture free form surfaces on monolithic arrays exceeding 200 mm edge length with high precision and reproducibility. These homogenizing elements in the illumination optics can provide a custom designed intensity distribution, and offer the possibility to correct the failure of other optical elements. Each lens can be designed individually and can also be shaped asymmetrically. Thus unusual lens sizes and shapes can be produced, and various far fields such as rectangles, lines, hexagons or multi-poles can be achieved. In this paper we present novel refractive micro-optical elements which create rectangular dipole illumination. They can also be combined in such a way as to create a quadrupole with variable intensity ratio between the vertical and horizontal poles. The huge advantage of such a multipole illumination is polarization control and variable intensity in poles. Working on this combination, the resolution can be enhanced even further.", "For 45 nm Node logic devices, we have investigated the impact of laser bandwidth fluctuation on Optical Proximity Effect (OPE) by evaluating variation in through-pitch critical dimension (CD) performance. In addition, from these results we have calculated the Iso-Dense Bias (IDB), and determined the sensitivity to laser bandwidth fluctuation. These IDB results also enable us to present the laser bandwidth stability that is required to maintain a constant OPE. And finally, we introduce results from an investigation into OPE-matching between different generations of exposure tools, whereby in addition to laser bandwidth control, tilt-scan methodology was employed.", "BaLiF3 single crystal has been studied as the candidate for the last lens material of the next generation high index immersion lithography system. Although the refractive index of BaLiF3 is 1.64 at 193nm which is not sufficient for the requirement, other optical properties such as 193nm transparency and laser durability fulfill the requirement. It is estimated that the cause of both high SBR part and inhomogeneity of refractive index of BaLiF3 seems to present along the faces of slip planes which are observed by crossed Nicol observation. As a result of comparative study of various direction perpendiculars to the growth axis, good crystallinity with less slip planes has been obtained by shifting the growth axis from <100> which is adequate for the last lens production. MgF2 single crystal studied as the polarizer material for high power ArF laser oscillator, and crystal with excellent laser durability and large diameter (>100mm) has been developed by CZ technique. In addition crystals oriented along both c-axis and a-axis were successfully grown.", "We present advancements in the manufacture of high-performance diffractive optical elements (DOEs) used in stepper/scanner off-axis illumination systems. These advancements have been made by employing high resolution lithographic techniques, in combination with precision glass-etching capabilities. Enhanced performance of DOE designs is demonstrated, including higher efficiency with improved uniformity for multi-pole illumination at the pupil plane, while maintaining low on-axis intensity. Theoretical predictions of the performance for several classes of DOE designs will be presented and compared with experimental results. This new process capability results in improved performance of current DOE designs, and enables greater customization including control of the output spatial intensity distribution for future designs. These advancements will facilitate continuous improvements in off-axis illumination optimization required by the end user to obtain larger effective lithographic process windows.", "Lens heating due to absorbed UV laser radiation can diminish the achievable spatial resolution of the lithographic process in semiconductor wafer steppers. At the Laser- Laboratorium G\u00f6ttingen a measurement system for quantitative registration of this thermal lens effect was developed. It is based upon a strongly improved Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor with extreme sensitivity, accomplishing precise online monitoring of wavefront deformations of a collimated test laser beam transmitted through the laser-irradiated site of a sample. Caused by the temperature-dependent refractive index as well as thermal expansion, the formerly plane wavefront of the test laser is distorted to form a rotationally symmetric valley, being equivalent to a convex lens. The observed wavefront distortion is a quantitative measure of the absorption losses in the sample. Thermal theory affords absolute calibration of absorption coefficients.", "Increasing productivity demands on leading-edge scanners require greatly improved light source availability. This translates directly to minimizing downtime and maximizing productive time, as defined in the SEMI E10 standard. Focused efforts to achieve these goals are ongoing and Cymer has demonstrated significant improvements on production light sources. This paper describes significant availability improvements of Cymer light sources enabled by a new advanced gas management scheme called Gas Lifetime eXtensioTM (GLTM) control system. Using GLX, we have demonstrated the capability of extending the pulse-based interval between full gas replenishments to 1 billion pulses on our XLA light sources, as well as significant extension in the time-based interval between refills. This represents a factor of 10X increase in the maximum interval between full gas replenishments, which equates to potential gain of up to 2% in productive time over a year for systems operating at high utilization. In this paper, we provide performance data on extended (1 billion pulse) laser operation without full gas replenishment under multiple actual practical production environments demonstrating the ability to achieve long gas lives with very stable optical performance from the laser system. In particular, we have demonstrated that GLX can provide excellent stability in key optical performance parameters, such as bandwidth, over extended gas lives. Further, these stability benefits can be realized under both high and low pulse accumulation scenarios. In addition, we briefly discuss the potential for future gas management enhancements that will provide even longer term system performance stability and corresponding reductions in tool downtime.", "The Argon Fluoride (ArF) immersion lithography is now shifting to mass production phase for below 45nm node. For a laser light source in this node, narrower and more stable spectrum performance is required. We have introduced GT61A ArF laser light source (60W/6kHz/10mJ/0.35pm) with spectrum E95 stabilization system which meets these requirements. The narrow and stabilized spectrum performance was achieved by developing an ultra line narrowing module and Bandwidth Control Module (BCM). It contributes to the reduction of differences of the spectrum during exposure over a wafer, wafer to wafer, during machine lifetime and machine to machine for every light source. Stable laser performance is obtained for mass production. The GT61A integrated on a common and already reliability-proven GigaTwin (GT) platform, and its inherited reliability is proved with the availability over 99.5% in the field.", "ArF immersion technology is spotlighted as the enabling technology for below 45nm node. Recently, double exposure technology is also considered for below 32nm node. We have already released an injection lock ArF excimer laser with ultra-line narrowed and stabilized spectrum performance: GT61A (60W/6kHz/ 10mJ/0.35pm) to ArF immersion market in Q4 2006. The requirements are: i) higher power ii) lower cost of downtime for higher throughput iii) greater wavelength stability for improved overlay and iv) increased lifetimes for lower operation costs. We have developed high power and high energy stability injection lock ArF excimer laser for double patterning: GT62A (90W/6000Hz/15mJ/0.35pm) based on the technology of GT61A and the reliability of GigaTwin (GT) platform. A high power operation of 90W is realized by development of high durability optical elements. Durability of the new optics is at least 3 times as long as that of the conventional optics used in the GT61A. The energy stability is improved more than 1.5 times of performance in the GT61A by optimizing laser operational conditions of the power oscillator. This improvement is accomplished by extracting potential efficiency of injection lock characteristic. The lifetime of power oscillator, which is one of the major parts in cost of ownership, is maintained by using higher output of the power supply.", "In this paper, we show that uniaxial crystals and sapphire in particular, can be used as a lens material for high-index immersion lithography. Although uniaxial crystals are birefringent and anisotropic for unpolarized light, under certain conditions they are fully isotropic for transverse electric (TE) polarizations. The strong birefringence of the uniaxial crystal defocuses the residual TM polarization relative to the TE mode so that its image does not reach the photoresist but rather creates a small background. To manifest this property, a combination of pupil-fill polarization constraints, mask design rules and crystal alignment requirements must be satisfied. Sapphire is a well-known industrial optical material featuring high optical quality and homogeneity. Its refractive index of 1.928 at 193 nm, along with its high thermal conductivity and moderate absorption, are close to industry requirements. An implementation of sapphire under these conditions is proposed, suggesting a path to the continued scaling of 193 nm lithography numerical aperture.", "Illumination for SRAM device pattern with peripheral circuit is optimized applying OPC during optimization. At first the memory cell is targeted, next library patterns that represent the peripheral circuit are added as the targets one by one, and it is investigated how the optimized illumination varies. As optimized targets ILS and dose-focus window are used. For the case of ILS the optimized illumination shapes become milder as more patterns are evaluated and the OPC result becomes weaker correspondingly. For the case of window the tendency is similar but not so intense. The illuminations optimized by ILS and window are different. The optimized illuminations by optical and resist simulation are a little different. As practical application illumination defined by functions such as annular is evaluated, where the information of actual scanners are applied. At first 1/4 divided polarization plate is used instead of tangential polarization. Secondly illumination is searched in the solution space that consists of hardware design instead of numerical expression. By introducing the information the optimized illuminations are varied. From these results it turns out that the optimization tool should handle the information of actual scanners properly. And we have developed the solution tool (k1-TUNE).", "Acceptance of Sub Resolution Assist Feature (SRAF) has been widely recognized in lithography patterning. In general, with the insertion of SRAF in optically adjacent space area of design main feature, the aerial image intensity profiles of the corresponding main features are apparently being either constructively or destructively alternated at imaging plane [Figure 1]. From lithography patterning perspective, the optimized or better pattern imaging process requires constructive SRAF. Such SRAF is inserted into available space for main feature to obtain optimal or better image contrast, better imaging resolution and depth of focus (DOF) which is similar or close to optimal focus latitude. However, the complementary destructive SRAF insertion can adversely occur in certain circumstances. In this paper, we study the theoretical understanding of the constructive and destructive effects against design main features imaging associated with the efforts to include SRAF (it's either driven by rule, model or mishap). In addition, an evaluation scheme is developed and being explored in many aspects in order to describe the constructive and destructive response of inserted SRAF. Such evaluation scheme has derived an application to detect the degree of SRAF insertion coverage accuracy, impact on manufacturing, and most usefully, to access potential layout required optimization in design space based on these complementary effects mechanism throughout several off-axis illumination conditions. eature", "As semiconductor technologies move toward 90nm generation and below, contact hole is one of the most challenging features to print in the semiconductor manufacturing process. There are two principal difficulties in order to define small contact hole pattern on wafer. One is insufficient process margin besides poor resolution compared with line & space pattern. The other is that contact hole should be made through pitches and sometimes random contact hole pattern should be fabricated. Therefore advanced ArF lithography scanner should be used for small contact hole printing with RETs (Resolution Enhancement Techniques) such as immersion lithography, OPC(Optical Proximity Correction), PSM(Phase Shift Mask), high NA(Numerical Aperture), OAI(Off-Axis Illumination), SRAF(Sub-resolution Assistant Feature), mask biasing and thermal flow. Like this, ArF lithography propose the method of enhancing resolution, however, we must spend an enormous amount of CoC(cost of ownership) to utilize ArF photolithography process than KrF. In this paper, we suggest the method of contact holes patterning by using KrF lithography tool in 90nm sFlash(stand alone Flash)devices. For patterning of contact hole, we apply RETs which combine OAI and Model based OPC. Additionally, in this paper we present the result of hole pattern images which operate ArF lithography equipment. Also, this study describes comparison of two wafer images that ArF lithography process which is used mask biasing and Rule based OPC, KrF lithography process which is applied hybrid OPC.", "As the pattern size shrinking down below 1/4 of the exposure wavelength, the NA of exposure tool has to be increased proportionally. The use of hyper NA and immersion exposure system for improving image quality may result in a small workable process window. Hence, resolution enhancement technology (RET) becomes a necessity for semiconductor manufacturing. Previous studies have demonstrated many RETs, such as CPL, DDL, IML and DPT etc. can improve the process window for different applications.1,2,3,4 In this work, we show manufacturing implementation of a 32nm node SRAM cell with different RET approaches. The diffusion, poly, contact, and metal layers were chosen as the target design. The process development project starts from the wafer exposure scheme setting, which includes the multi-exposure, illumination shape and mask type. After the RET has been specified, the process performance indexes, such as MEEF, PW, and CDU are characterized by using both simulation and empirical data. The mask design and OPC is implemented After the mask data preparation step, we then optimize exposure parameters for best printing performance and follow it by verifying actual wafer data. The mask making spec and DFM design rule constrains have been assessed and recommended for 32nm node manufacturing. Also, we have examined the immersion process defect impact and control methodology for production environment. In this paper, we report the result of optimizing RET process (including mask data generation, reticle making specifications, and wafer printing) for 32nm SRAM. With 193nm ultra high NA immersion exposure scanner (such as ASML /1900), it is capable of meeting 32nm SRAM manufacturing requirement.", "Printing random Contact Holes (C/H) is one of the most difficult tasks in current low-k1 lithography. Different approaches have been proposed and demonstrated successfully. One approach is the use of extensive Resolution Enhancement Technique such as sub-resolution assisting features, focus drilling and interference mapping lithography in combination with strong off-axis illumination. These techniques often lead to enhanced complexity at the OPC and mask making side. In order to keep the complexity low, soft illumination modes have been proposed like Soft-Annular (bull'seye) and Soft-Quasar type illumination [1]. It has been shown that the minimum k1 for the latter route is k1=0.41 using experimental results up to 0.93 NA. In this paper we demonstrate that the latter route can be extended to 45nm C/H at a minimum pitch of 120nm when using 1.35 NA. In order to achieve this we additionally applied a CD sizing technique to create the very small C/H.", "At 45 and 32 nm nodes, one of the most critical layers is the Contact one. Due to the use of hyper NA imaging, the depth of focus starts to be very limited. Moreover the OPC is rapidly limited because of the increase of the pattern density. The limited surface in the dark field region of a Contact layer mask enforces the edges movement to stop very quickly. The use of SRAF (Sub Resolution Assist Feature) has been widely use for DOF enhancement of line and space layers since many technology node. Recently, SRAF generated using inverse lithography have shown interesting DOF improvement1. However, the advantage of the ideal mask generated by inverse lithography is lost when switching to a manufacturable mask with Manhattan structures. For SRAF placed in rule based as well as Manhattan SRAF generated after inverse lithography, it is important to know what their behavior is, in term of size and placement. In this article we propose to study the placement of scatter-trenches assist features for the contact layer. For this we have performed process window simulation with different SRAF sizes and distance to the main OPC. These results permit us to establish the trends for size and placement of the SRAF. Moreover we have also take a look of the advantages of using 8 surrounding SRAF (4 in vertical - horizontal and 4 at 45\u00b0) versus 4 surrounding SRAF. Based on these studies we have seen that there is no real gain of increasing the complexity by adding additional SRAF.", "In development of optical proximity correction (OPC) for new technology nodes, optimization of assist features requires multiple placement scenarios for each line/space or hole combination. Additionally, illumination and process conditions are varied to determine the optimal process window. Under some illumination and process conditions, optimal printing of the desired features is attained; however, undesired printing of sidelobes or sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) also occurs. Currently, CD sizes are measured for the desired feature and images are hand checked for unwanted features (sidelobe or SRAF printing). This takes a large amount of time, given the hundreds to thousands of CDSEM measurements required to generate a given OPC model. This problem is multiplied if several passes of data collection are needed to optimize each OPC model and each layer. An automated method has been developed to quickly screen a large number of SEM images for unwanted features, and if they exist, flag the measurement point so it can be easily identified as an undesirable area of the process window. This method employs edge placement measurement capabilities available with automated SEM recipe generation software to identify the presence of an unwanted feature within a given image. A simple Boolean filter is used to exclude this process area as SRAF or sidelobe printing process space so it may be excluded from the OPC model and from the operational process space. This automated method for identification of SRAFs or sidelobes provides significant engineering time savings and allows characterization of the onset of undesirable features to assist in optimization of OPC within a given process window.", "Attenuated PSM (Phase Shift Mask) has been widely adopted in contact lithography to enhance the resolution and process latitude. While the main drawback associated with the use of attenuated PSM is the side lobe printing, which yields unwanted resist erosion of area among patterned holes. Side lobes, if etched and filled in the following semiconductor processing, can cause electrical shorting, chip failure and device reliability problem, hence any side lobes are extremely undesirable. Usually, the side lobe detection for simple layouts can be conducted manually through the help of lithography simulation tools, but the detection of potential side lobe printing becomes far more challenging for full-chip production layouts. An efficient side-lobe detection approach was demonstrated in this study, with the use of assistant ring, polygon-based simulation instead of grid-based simulation has been enabled for full-chip side lobe detection. Furthermore, a model-based method for side lobe suppression was also demonstrated in our flow.", "A novel RET, which enables on-grid sub-50 nm hole pattern formation with ArF immersion lithography, has been developed. One of the authors has found quasi-iso-focal point image generation at the center of square area of high transmission embedded attenuating phase shift mask (EA-PSM), where four small openings are laid out at the corners of the area, utilizing an optimized quadrupole illumination. As an extension of continuous configuration, checker-board like mask pattern arrangement is created. In the mask, small openings and opaque pads are arranged like as checkerboard, whose base pitch is around resolution limit of targeted optical system. The mask pattern arrangement is named as \"Checker-Board PSM (CB-PSM)\". By eliminating any one opening from \"checker-board\", very fine point image is generated at the place. Because four openings around the eliminated one are necessary for the fine imaging characteristic, minimum distance between the point images is about the double of that for resolution limit. After simulation study of imaging, experiments are carried out to prove the fine imaging performance utilizing ArF immersion optics with NA=1.07 and a tri-level resist system. As a result, sub-50nm isolated hole is successfully formed with DOF larger than 200 nm. Simultaneously, ~ 60 nm semi-dense hole with pitch of 240 nm is printed with over 200 nm DOF. Moreover, application of conventional mask pattern arrangement, ultimately dense hole of 140nm pitch is well formed. As a conclusion, we believe that CB-PSM is a promising candidate for hole pattern formation at 32 nm node and beyond.", "Resolution enhancement technology (RET) refers to a technique that extends the usable resolution of an imaging system without decreasing the wavelength of light or increasing the numerical aperture (NA) of the imaging tool. Offaxis illumination (OAI) and a phase shift mask (PSM) are essentially accompanied by optical proximity correction (OPC) for semiconductor device manufacturing nowadays. A chromeless PSM (CLM or CPL) is compared to an attenuated PSM (att.PSM) to make 45 nm dense line and space pattern. To obtain the best possible resolution, a proper OPC is required with CPL and the most common application of OPC technique is the use of space bias. The optical system with a high numerical aperture (NA), a strong OAI, and a proper polarization can decrease the k1 value well below 0.3. CPL has various advantages over alternating PSM such as no necessity of double exposure, small pattern displacement, and no CD error caused by the intensity imbalance. But CPL has some disadvantages. In the case of 100 % transmittance pure CPL, there is no shading material that is usually deposited on the line pattern for both att.PSM and alternating PSM to control the line width. Because of no shading material for CPL, the required resist critical dimension (CD) has to be obtained by using phase only and it is difficult to control the resist CD through pitch. As expected, CPL needs smaller dose than att.PSM to make the desired 45 nm CD with 0.94 NA. Our simulation results showed that 10 nm negative bias is optimum for CPL mask. We demonstrated that CPL mask and att.PSM technology can be used to make 45 nm node by the negative space bias.", "It is well-known that the available depth of focus (DoF) tend to decrease for each advancing technology node. Moreover the leveling control on wafer topography has become a challenge to affect the focus control on exposure tool capability, especially for the critical hole-structure layer of the back end of line (BEoL). In this study, we used the via layer from the real products as an example of optimizing the exposure tool's leveling system to reduce process-related influences to improve the intra-field focus control range. First, the focus-exposure matrices (FEMs) were applied to a wafer in different leveling modes. Then, patterns' critical dimension (CD) in different locations within the same field were measured to produce the Bossung curves required to determine the best focus. The same steps were repeated on a bare wafer to illustrate how the process reduced the common depth of focus range. We also introduced the non-optical leveling sensor, which measured the wafer by the use of physical methods. Since it does not interact with the film stack or the pattern density, the measurement accuracy will be insensitive to process variation. Therefore, it can be used to compensate the optically induced errors from the optical leveling system and to expand the useful depth of focus for improving CD uniformity. Finally, we briefly summarize the improvement ratio achieved of the common DoF using these optical and non-optical leveling systems with different leveling modes.", "In this paper, a study on customized illumination shape configurations as resolution enhancement for 45nm technology node will be presented. Several new source shape configurations will be explored through simulation based on 193nm immersion lithography on 6% Attenuated Phase Shift Mask. Forbidden pitch effect is commonly encountered in the application of off axis illumination (OAI). The illumination settings are often optimized to allow maximum process window for a pitch. This is done by creating symmetrical distribution of diffraction order on the pupil plane. However, at other pitch, the distribution of diffraction order on the pupil plane results in severe degradation in image contrast and results in significant critical dimension (CD) fluctuation. The problematic pitch is often known as forbidden pitch. It has to be avoided in the design and thus limited the pitch range to be imaged for particular illumination. An approach to modify off axis illumination to minimize the effect of forbidden pitch is explored in this study. The new customized shape for one dimensional line and space pattern is modified from current off axis illumination. Simulation study is done to evaluate the performance some customized shapes. The extent of CD fluctuation and CD through pitch uniformity is analyzed to determine the performance enhancement of the new illumination shapes. From simulation result, the proposed modification have significantly improved the through pitch performance and minimized the effect of forbidden pitch.", "As the semiconductor industry continues progressing toward increasingly complex and unforgiving processes of device shrinkage and shorter duration of device development, many industry participants from photo-lithography are taking interest in material and structure of the photolithography mask. Due to shorter wavelength of the source laser and device technology ranging around the order of magnitude for the source laser wavelength (ArF), the difference in mask material and structure shows greater performance difference then larger technology node. Especially around 50nm and beyond, many industry followers are reporting better performance from different types of mask then previously used. In this study, we will analyze the effect of the photo lithography mask material for sub 50nm device, in development perspective. Two major types of mask will be evaluated on the scale of device development. Effects such as Mask Error Effect Factor (MEEF), Depth of Focus (DOF), Exposure Latitude (EL) and Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU) will be analyzed for both binary and attenuated phase shifted mask under different process condition. Also, we will evaluate the comparison result for application on development of sub 45nm device.", "HTPSM (High-Transmission Phase Shift Mask) is one of the most promising mask technologies for photolithography resolution enhancement. However, it s well known that the use of HTPSM frequently results in unwanted patterns due to inevitable pinching effects, particularly in spacious areas. Although pinching effect can be effectively suppressed by the application of additional Cr patterns at the problematic locations, it is a critical challenge to systematically detect and automatically correct the complicated patterns in most of realistic cases. We demonstrated remarkable photolithography process window improvement by the use of HTPSM (A type and above) with the focus on the development of a systematic methodology for automatic detection and correction of abnormal patterns due to optical pinching effect. Regular optical rules check (ORC) with specific modifications was employed to precisely locate the potential pinched areas, whereas enhanced design rules check (DRC) was applied subsequently to generate the required additional Cr patterns for final mask fabrication. A variety of photolithography variables, such as wavelength and numerical aperture (NA) were extensively investigated against optical pinching effect to confirm the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed detection/correction methodology for HTPSM application.", "Model based OPC has been generally used to correct proximity effects down to ~50 nm critical dimensions at k1 values around 0.3. As design rules shrink and k1 drops below 0.3, however; it is very hard to obtain enough process window and acceptable MEEF (Mask Error Enhancement Factor) with conventional model based OPC. Recently, ILT (Inverse Lithography Technology) has been introduced and has demonstrated wider process windows than conventional OPC. The ILT developed by Luminescent uses level-set methods to find the optimal photo mask layout, which maximizes the process window subject to mask manufacturing constraints. We have evaluated performance of ILT for critical dimensions of 55nm, printed under conditions corresponding to k1 ~ 0.28. Results indicated a larger process window and better pattern fidelity than obtained with other methods. In this paper, we present the optimization procedures, model calibration and evaluation results for 55 nm metal and contact layers and discuss the possibilities and the limitations of this new technology.", "We discussed to KrF process extension for 90 nm technology node. The continuous shrinkage of critical dimensions on sub 130 nm devices becomes a key point to improve process margin with pattern resolution problem for lithography. Recently, according to development demand of high density and high integration device, it is tendency that the shrink rate of design rule is gradually accelerated. It is difficult to develop with image contrast problem around k1=0.25 which is a theoretical process limit region. We need to technology development which is available to having resolution for sub 90nm line and space by using KrF lithography not by using ArF lithography. In generally, KrF have not been used in nano-process such as 90nm technology. In this study, however, we can apply the KrF in 90nm technology by means of minimizing the error range in the nano-process, optimizing the process, and extending the process margin. This Application of KrF in 90nm technology results in elimination of additional investment for development of 90nm technology. Finally, we will show which simulation and experimental results such as normalized image log slope, pupil plane, image of focus variation, process window, top view image, photo resist and etch profile, and pitch linearity.", "The ever increasing NA to meet the stringent requirements on pitch and litho target does not come without a price. In particular for the printing of contact layers, the toll is taken in terms of decreased process latitudes and CD uniformity. Depending on the specific contact layer design, it has become increasingly important to choose the most adequate resolution enhancement technique. At the ultimate NA of 1.35, depth of focus through pitch has become a key factor, and values in the order of 100-120nm are the painful truth imposed by physics. In this paper, the attention goes to through-pitch contact imaging, with the attempt to achieve half pitches around 60nm. Thereby, the main focus lies on the relation between source shape and minimum achievable k1. In addition, the pro's and con's of two options for throughpitch process latitude enhancement are considered. These options are firstly the effect of assist feature placement in combination with off-axis illumination, and secondly the application of the Focus Drilling technique. Finally, the different contributions to contact hole CD non-uniformity are addressed.", "Immersion Lithography is the most important technique for extending optical lithography's capabilities and meeting the requirements of Semiconductor Roadmap. The introduction of immersion tools has recently allowed the development of 45nm technology node in single exposure. Nevertheless the usage of hyper-high NA scanners (NA > 1), some levels still remain very critical to be imaged with sufficient process performances. For memory devices, contact mask is for sure the most challenging layer. Aim of this paper is to present the lithographic assessment of 193nm contact holes process, with k1 value of ~0.30 using NA 1.20 immersion lithography (minimum pitch is 100nm). Different issues will be reported, related to mask choices (Binary or Attenuated Phase Shift) and illuminator configurations. First phase of the work will be dedicated to a preliminary experimental screening on a simple test case in order to reduce the variables in the following optimization sections. Based on this analysis we will discard X-Y symmetrical illuminators (Annular, C-Quad) due to poor contrast. Second phase will be dedicated to a full simulation assessment. Different illuminators will be compared, with both mask type and several mask biases. From this study, we will identify some general trends of lithography performances that can be used for the fine tuning of the RET settings. The last phase of the work will be dedicated to find the sensitivity trends for one of the analyzed illuminators. In particular we study the effect of Numerical Aperture, mask bias in both X and Y direction and poles sigma ring-width and centre.", "The semiconductor industry faces a lithographic scaling limit as the industry completes the transition to 1.35 NA immersion lithography. Both high-index immersion lithography and EUV lithography are facing technical challenges and commercial timing issues. Consequently, the industry has focused on enabling double patterning technology (DPT) as a means to circumvent the limitations of Rayleigh scaling. Here, the IBM development alliance demonstrate a series of double patterning solutions that enable scaling of logic constructs by decoupling the pattern spatially through mask design or temporally through innovative processes. These techniques have been successfully employed for early 32nm node development using 45nm generation tooling. Four different double patterning techniques were implemented. The first process illustrates local RET optimization through the use of a split reticle design. In this approach, a layout is decomposed into a series of regions with similar imaging properties and the illumination conditions for each are independently optimized. These regions are then printed separately into the same resist film in a multiple exposure process. The result is a singly developed pattern that could not be printed with a single illumination-mask combination. The second approach addresses 2D imaging with particular focus on both line-end dimension and linewidth control [1]. A double exposure-double etch (DE2) approach is used in conjunction with a pitch-filling sacrificial feature strategy. The third double exposure process, optimized for via patterns also utilizes DE2. In this method, a design is split between two separate masks such that the minimum pitch between any two vias is larger than the minimum metal pitch. This allows for final structures with vias at pitches beyond the capability of a single exposure. In the fourth method,, dark field double dipole lithography (DDL) has been successfully applied to BEOL metal structures and has been shown to be overlay tolerant [6]. Collectively, the double patterning solutions developed for early learning activities at 32nm can be extended to 22nm applications.", "Including etch-based empirical data during OPC model calibration is a desired yet controversial decision for OPC modeling, especially for process with a large litho to etch biasing. While many OPC software tools are capable of providing this functionality nowadays; yet few were implemented in manufacturing due to various risks considerations such as compromises in resist and optical effects prediction, etch model accuracy or even runtime concern. Conventional method of applying rule-based alongside resist model is popular but requires a lot of lengthy code generation to provide a leaner OPC input. This work discusses risk factors and their considerations, together with introduction of techniques used within Mentor Calibre VT5 etch-based modeling at sub 90nm technology node. Various strategies are discussed with the aim of better handling of large etch bias offset without adding complexity into final OPC package. Finally, results were presented to assess the advantages and limitations of the final method chosen.", "Within the past several years, IC design and manufacture technology node transits rapidly from 0.13um to 65nm and 45nm. Whatever the technology node is, the same goal that both the designer and the manufacturer put most of their effort on is how to improve the chip yield as high as possible. A bunch of evidences have shown that the final yield is extremely related to the pattern transfer from design to wafer. But with the critical dimension shrinks, the largest challenge that the whole industry meets is how to keep high fidelity while transferring the patterns. Since the process window is now very limited even with the assistance of kinds of resolution enhancement technology, a tiny process deviation may cause large critical dimension variation, which will result in significant device character change. Micro-lithography combined with Optical proximity correct is supposed to be the most critical stage in pattern transfer stage. But conventional OPC always use nominal model, which will not take random process variation into account during applying OPC. This work will demonstrate our experiment in OPC with process window model, which is then proved to have obvious improvement in pattern fidelity.", "The lithographic processes and resolution enhancement techniques (RET) needed to achieve pattern fidelity are becoming more complicated as the required critical dimensions (CDs) shrink. For technology nodes with smaller devices and tolerances, more complex models and proximity corrections are needed and these significantly increase the computational requirements. New simulation techniques are required to address these computational challenges. The new simulation technique we focus on in this work is dense optical proximity correction (OPC). Sparse OPC tools typically require a laborious, manual and time consuming OPC optimization approach. In contrast, dense OPC uses pixel-based simulation that does not need as much manual setup. Dense OPC was introduced because sparse simulation methodology causes run times to explode as the pattern density increases, since the number of simulation sites in a given optical radius increases. In this work, we completed a comparison of the OPC modeling performance and run time for the dense and the sparse solutions. The analysis found the computational run time to be highly design dependant. The result should lead to the improvement of the quality and performance of the OPC solution and shed light on the pros and cons of using dense versus sparse solution. This will help OPC engineers to decide which solution to apply to their particular situation.", "As tolerance requirements for the lithography process continue to shrink with each new technology node, the contributions of all process sequence steps to the critical dimension error budgets are being closely examined, including wafer exposure, resist processing, pattern etch, as well as the photomask process employed during the wafer exposure. Along with efforts to improve the mask manufacturing processes, the elimination of residual mask errors via pattern correction has gained renewed attention. The portfolio of correction tools for mask process effects is derived from well established techniques commonly used in optical proximity correction and in electron beam proximity effect compensation. The process component that is not well captured in the correction methods deployed in mask manufacturing today is etch. A mask process model to describe the process behavior and to capture the physical effects leading to deviation of the critical dimension from the target value represents the key component of model-based correction and verification. This paper presents the flow for generating mask process models that describe both shortrange and long-range mask process effects, including proximity loading effects from etching, pattern density loading effects, and across-mask process non-uniformity. The flow is illustrated with measurement data from real test masks. Application of models for both mask process correction and verification is discussed.", "We formulate the mask modeling as a parametric model order reduction problem. We then apply a robust reduction technique to generate the compact mask model. Since this model is based on first principle, it naturally includes diffraction, polarization and couplings, important effects that are poorly handled by the modified thin-mask model (MTMM). The model generation involves only a few sampling solves of the governing equation, much fewer than that needed to generate MTMM. Though the model evaluation takes marginally more CPU time than MTMM, the accuracy and the robustness of the new model are based on much more rigorous theoretical foundation.", "Resolution enhancement technologies (RET), such as optical proximity correction (OPC) help us develop sub- 100nm technology node by using photolithography equipments and materials for 130nm photolithographic process. Because the resolution of scanner and materials has arrived almost at their limit, small patterns below resolution limit are more sensitively affected by very small tolerance of various factors which were not considered by major process parameters such like lens flare, reticle haze, reticle critical dimensional (CD) errors, etc. As patterning small ones under resolution limit directly means large MEEF (mask error enhancement factor) in photo process, reticle CD errors are actually magnified on wafer. Therefore, reticle CD errors should be tightly controlled when we try to define small patterns under resolution limit. As the feature size shrinks down, the importance of OPC model accuracy grows up for the purpose of ensuring high pattern fidelity. In conventional process of OPC model generation, we don't concern how mask database CDs are exactly matched with real reticle CDs, since the specification of reticle CD is enough tight to ignore CD variation on the reticle such as 1-dimensional CD difference, linearity CD uniformity. But in the process with large MEEF, OPC model with incorrect CD information of reticle has a bad influence to prediction pattern fidelity. In this paper, we describe the effect of reticle CD errors on the OPC model accuracy. To quantify that effect, we compared two cases of OPC model generation. One is making OPC model by using mask database CDs themselves, the other is by using mask real CDs in 110nm node for poly and metal 1 (damascene) layers. As a consequence of the test, we can achieve the accuracy OPC model calibrated with reticle CD errors which better predicts wafer CDs and 2- dimensional images than the model, calibrated by original database CDs.", "The concept of focus blur encompasses the effect of laser bandwidth longitudinal chromatic aberration and scanner stage vertical vibration. The finite bandwidth of excimer laser source causes a corresponding finite distribution of focal planes in a range of 100nm or larger for the optical lithography system. Similarly, scanner vertical stage vibration puts the wafer in a finite distribution of focal planes. Both chromatic aberration and vertical stage vibration could introduce significant CD errors, hence can no longer be ignored in current lithography processes development and OPC development that require CD control within a few nanometers. We developed several methodologies to model the laser chromatic aberration and vertical stage vibration in OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) modeling tool. Extensive simulations were done to calculate chromatic aberration and vertical stage vibration focus blur's impact on lithography patterning for a variety of test structures. Chromatic aberration and vertical stage vibration focus blur effect was further included as an regression term in experimental OPC model calibration to capture its impact on litho patterning, and significant benefit to OPC model calibration was observed.", "Flare has become a significant problem for low K1 lithography process.[1] It is generally divided into three parts: long-, local-, short-range. Long-range flare is scattering over a scale of tens of microns, come from reflections within the projection lens. Short-range is scattering over a scale of about 1 micron or less, come from lens aberrations. And localrange flare is scattering over about 1 to 10 microns, comes from inhomogenieties within glass and local pattern density. Especially, local-range flare causes the printed width to vary or degrade printing accuracy. Normally, the local-range flare effect is increase by local pattern density. Therefore the local flare effect can be reduced if the effect of local pattern density within die is compensated effectively. In this paper, we discussed full chip compensation for local flare effect using OPC/DRC method. First of all, we investigated relationship between local flare and pattern density using test pattern and extracted OPC model according to pattern density and also analyzed within chip pattern density distribution using DRC. We separated original layout to OPC target layout according to local pattern density, applied different OPC model to each separated layout. We will show within chip CD variation was improved after local flare effects reduction.", "When using the most advanced water-based immersion scanner at the 32nm node half-pitch, the image resolution will be below the k1 limit of 0.25. If EUV technology is not ready for mass production, double patterning technology (DPT) is one of the solutions to bridge the gap between wet ArF and EUV platforms. DPT technology implies a patterning process with two photolithography/etching steps. As a result, the critical pitch is reduced by a factor of 2, which means the k1 value could increase by a factor of 2. Due to the superimposition of patterns printed by two separate patterning steps, the overlay capability, in addition to image capability, contributes to critical dimension uniformity (CDU). The wafer throughput as well as cost is a concern because of the increased number of process steps. Therefore, the performance of imaging, overlay, and throughput of a scanner must be improved in order to implement DPT cost effectively. In addition, DPT requires an innovative software to evenly split the patterns into two layers for the full chip. Although current electronic design automation (EDA) tools can split the pattern through abundant geometry-manipulation functions, these functions, however, are insufficient. A rigorous pattern split requires more DPT-specific functions such as tagging/grouping critical features with two colors (and hence two layers), controlling the coloring sequence, correcting the printing error on stitching boundaries, dealing with color conflicts, increasing the coloring accuracy, considering full-chip possibility, etc. Therefore, in this paper we cover these issues by demonstrating a newly developed DPT pattern-split algorithm using a rule-based method. This method has one strong advantage of achieving very fast processing speed, so a full-chip DPT pattern split is practical. After the pattern split, all of the color conflicts are highlighted. Some of the color conflicts can be resolved by aggressive model-based methods, while the un-resolvable conflicts, known as native conflicts, require a change in the design to achieve a DPTfriendly design. A model-based stitching boundary correction is then used after the color conflicts are corrected. Finally the OPC treatment is implemented on both split layouts. The OPC challenges are highlighted by examining the printed image from both exposures. The key concepts described above with additional full chip requirements have been successfully implemented onto Brion's TachyoTM system. The efficiency and accuracy of the DPT pattern split method were evaluated on a full-chip layout. The results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper is a viable solution for the DPT pattern split.", "An important step in today's Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing is optical proximity correction (OPC). In model based OPC, masks are systematically modified to compensate for the non-ideal optical and process effects of optical lithography system. The polygons in the layout are fragmented, and simulations are performed to determine the image intensity pattern on the wafer. Then the mask is perturbed by moving the fragments to match the desired wafer pattern. This iterative process continues until the pattern on the wafer matches the desired one. Although OPC increases the fidelity of pattern transfer to the wafer, it is quite CPU intensive; OPC for modern IC designs can take days to complete on computer clusters with thousands of CPU. In this paper, techniques from statistical machine learning are used to predict the fragment movements. The goal is to reduce the number of iterations required in model based OPC by using a fast and efficient solution as the initial guess to model based OPC. To determine the best model, we train and evaluate several principal component regression models based on prediction error. Experimental results show that fragment movement predictions via regression model significantly decrease the number of iterations required in model based OPC.", "Various resolution enhancement techniques have been proposed in order to enable optical lithography at low k1 imaging, e.g. alt-PSM (phase shift mask), chromeless phase lithography (CPL), double exposure technique (DET) and double dipole lithography (DDL). In spite of its low throughput in production, DDL technique is a very attractive solution for low k1 process because of the relatively low cost of binary or attenuated phase shift masks, which can be combined with strong dipole illuminations and flexible SRAF rule to enhance the process window. Another attraction of DDL is that dry scanner still can be used for 45nm node instead of expensive immersion lithography process. In this paper, two aspects for DDL application have been focused on. The first one is OPC optimization method for DDL, which includes SRAF optimization, mask decomposition and pixel-based OPC. The whole flow is optimized specifically for DDL to achieve satisfactory pattern results on wafer. The second is the overlay issue. Since two DDL masks are exposed in turn, the overlay variation between two masks becomes dominant factor deteriorating pattern quality. The effect of overlay tolerance is also studied through process window simulation. DDL has been demonstrated to be capable of 45nm node logic with dry scanner. The pattern fidelity and process window of 45nm node SRAM & Random Logic are evaluated for active/gate layer and dark field metal layer.", "At 65 nm and below, full-chip verification of OPC is done for nominal dose and focus, as well as for process corners representing a two-to-three sigma deviation from the manufacturing setpoints. Such an approach interrogates the intersection of design layout with process variation to elucidate specific locations which will tend to be yield-limiting in manufacturing. With vanishingly small margins between allowable process windows and real in-fab variability, it is of utmost importance to optimize the critical exposure parameters such as projection optic numerical aperture, illumination source mode and sigma, and source polarization. The traditional approach to optimizing these exposure conditions has involved selecting representative feature test patterns (such as 1D lines at multiple pitches, or memory cells), placing simulation cutlines across selected locations, establishing allowable CD tolerances, and calculating overlapping process windows for all cutlines of interest. Such approaches are to first order effective in coarse tuning exposure conditions, but underutilize the rich information content which is available from today's rapid large-area post-OPC simulation engines. We report here on the use of full-chip post-OPC simulation and error checking in conjunction with illumination optimization tooling to provide a more thorough and versatile statistical analysis capability. It is shown that the new method proposed here results in a more robust process window than that which would be obtained by the conditions selected using the traditional optimization method.", "Optical proximity correction (OPC) of contact-hole printing is challenging since its two dimensional shapes requires through understanding of lithographic processes compared to one dimensional line and space pattering. Moreover, recently, it is common to use \"elongated contact holes\" with large contact area, rather than simple circular ones, for small electrical resistance. These elongated contact holes make it even more difficult to generate a good OPC model than the circular ones because the elongated contact-hole patterning causes the asymmetric process effects. For example, impacts of mask CD error, resist diffusion and resist development are different depending on the orientation of the elongated contact holes. This paper presents how the OPC model for the elongated contact-hole can be improved as the mask CD error compensation, accurate resist diffusion model and a new Variable Threshold Model (VTM) are applied for the asymmetric process effects.", "Recently, there have been many studies on the mask topography effect on patterning. Most of existing papers report generally focused on the difference of the aerial image between the thin mask approximation and the rigorous topographic mask models. In this paper, the mask topography effect was analyzed from an OPC modeling perspective. We compared the accuracy of two types of the virtual OPC model of contact patterns that one model used the virtual test patterns generated by the lithography simulator based on the thin mask approximation model and the virtual test patterns of another model were made by the rigorous topographic mask simulation based on FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) method. All conditions of lithography simulations and OPC modeling between two models were same except the mask topography parameters in generating virtual test patterns. Differences in model accuracy and convergence values of regression parameters of each models indicated that current OPC modeling tool based on the thin mask approximated optical simulation did not sufficiently cover the mask topography effect, and 3D mask effect should be considered more carefully.", "Test pattern data set filtering based on the concept of parameter sensitivity is proposed to reduce OPC time-to-model requirements. The concept of parameter sensitivity-based filtering is discussed briefly, followed by a methodology to apply the filtering to test pattern sets prior to data measurement along with a number of potential data filtering algorithms. The proposed methodology is then applied to an experimental data set targeted for a 32nm logic process. Qualitative observations are made on the initial data filtering, followed by quantitative metrics based on best-fit models for each of the data filtering algorithms. Results demonstrate that a comparable model is achievable using the proposed data filtering methods and one of the filtering algorithms.", "As the patterning of IC manufacturing shrinks to the 32-nm node and beyond, high-NA and immersion lithography are required for pushing resolution to its physical limit. To achieve good OPC performance, various physical effects such as polarization, mask topography, and mask pellicle have to be considered to improve the model accuracy. The attenuation and the phase variation of TE and TM wave components induced by the pellicle would impact optical qualities in terms of resolution, distortion, defocus shift, and high-order aberrations. In this paper, the OPC model considering pellicle effects is investigated with Jones pupil. The CD variation induced by the pellicle effect can be predicted accurately. Therefore, the improvement on model accuracy for 32-nm node is demonstrated.", "OPC models have been improving their accuracy over the years by modeling more error sources in the lithographic systems, but model calibration techniques are improving at a slower pace. One area of modeling calibration that has garnered little interest is the statistical variance of the calibration data set. OPC models are very susceptible to parameter divergence with statistical variance, but modest caution is given to the data variance once the calibration sequence has started. Not only should the calibration data be a good representation of the design intent, but measure redundancy is required to take into consideration the process and metrology variance. Considering it takes five to nine redundant measurements to generate a good statistical distribution for averaging and it takes tens of thousands of measurements to mimic the design intent, the data volume requirements become overwhelming. Typically, the data redundancy is reduced due to this data explosion, so some level of variance will creep into the model-tuning process. This is a feasibility study for treatment of data variance during model calibration. This approach was developed to improve the model fitness for primary out-of-specification features present in the calibration test pattern by performing small manipulations of the measured data combined with data weighting during the model calibration process. This data manipulation is executed in image-parameter groups (Imin, Imax, slope and curvature) to control model convergence. These critical-CD perturbations are typically fractions of nanometers, which is consistent with the residual variance of the statically valid data set. With this datamanipulation approach the critical features are pulled into specification without diverging other feature types. This paper will detail this model calibration technique and the use of imaging parameters and weights to converge the model for key feature types. It will also demonstrate its effectiveness on realistic applications.", "Low K1 photolithography process increases the complexity of RET applications in IC designs. As technology node shrinks, pattern density is much denser along with much smaller geometry dimensions. Model-based OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) and post-OPC verification require more complex models and through process window compensated approaches, which significantly increase computational burden. Both lithographical challenges and computational complexity associated with 45nm process and below create a need for advanced capabilities on commercial OPC tools. To answer those challenges, hardware-accelerated OPC solution made a debut to solve runtime bottleneck issues, but they came in with very expensive price tags. As today, there are no explorations on the linkage between design styles and layout pattern OPC reusability. This paper introduces a new OPC flow with pattern-centric approach to leverage OPC knowledge of repeated design cells and patterns to achieve fast full chip OPC convergence, shorter cycle time, better OPC quality, and eventually lead to high manufacturing yields. In this paper, the main concepts of pattern-based OPC flow are demonstrated in 65nm customer memory designs. Pattern-based OPC is a natural extension of Anchor's pattern-centric approaches in DFM (Design for Manufacturing) domain.", "We establish criteria to recognize extreme OPC corrections and discuss their difference from the traditional corrections. Then we present new proximity correction methods for rigorous bi- and tri- tone mask optimization that cast problem as a constraint minimization over the space of piecewise constant or continuous functions. The primary optimization objective is stated as a contour integral over the target. The constraints on image amplitude form convex functionals for dark areas and non-convex functionals for bright areas. A Lagrangian of this constrained problem is minimized. This delivers extreme, aggressive mask corrections, which are not confined by the fragmentation schema or the orientation of its sites. We analyze performance of these corrections under challenging process conditions and evaluate fidelity benefits.", "The low k1-factor challenge in current photolithography has made OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) indispensable for critical patterning layers, and more efforts are needed in the development and calibration of OPC model. One of the key factors that affect the accuracy of wafer result is the accuracy of OPC model, and usually, only a few nanometers' fitting residual of OPC model is tolerable. So, several methods have been reported for improving the accuracy of OPC modeling, but the model fitting becomes more complex as the increase of fitting parameters accordingly. In this paper, the variable loading kernel to manipulate the behavior of OPC modeling was reported. The variable load kernel can be modified by space domain, and it also can be the combination of many load kernels, such as Kload= a1*Kload1 + a2*Kload2 + ...... + an*Kloadn. By combining of different variable load kernels, the resultant load kernel can be more flexible to manage the model behavior in different line widths and pitches. In the example of OPC fitting residuals of linearity patterns, it is obvious that the different models with different loading kernels yielded different residuals. The use of variable loading kernel achieves the satisfied small residuals for both small and large patterns simultaneously. Accordingly, easier OPC modeling with smaller fitting residual is anticipated by variable load kernel method.", "CD control specifications for poly gate patterning are becoming tighter and tighter: latest revisions of International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors require a CD control in the range of 2.2nm (3\u03c3) for the 65nm technology node. In this scenario model-based Optical Proximity Correction methodologies, traditionally developed to address optical and resist development effects, had to face the challenge to correct post-resist processing steps with the aim to guarantee a final effective CD control within expected specifications. Complex 1D rule-based corrections, applied in the past, are no more adequate to capture complex 2D effects becoming relevant starting from 90nm node; only a more comprehensive 2D model-based approach can correctly predict, and so compensate, complex physical and chemical etch phenomena inducing CD variations. In this paper we experimentally study the impact of medium and long range etch effects on poly gate patterning, trying to identify their nature and impact on intra-die CD variations. Different innovative model-based approaches for lithography and etch effects compensation are evaluated and compared on Flash memory circuitry (90, 65 and 45 nm node) with the aim to reduce intra-die CD dispersion component. Finally the impact of local and global pattern density on etch behavior is studied in relation to different dummy placement strategies.", "Model-based Optical Proximity Correction (MBOPC) has become one of the most important resolution enhancement technologies (RETs), which can effectively improve the image fidelity and process robustness. MBOPC is performed by iteratively shifting the polygon edges of mask patterns until convergence requirements are achieved. In this paper, we specifically discuss the design of feedback controllers to improve MBOPC convergence. Effective controller design rules are derived from the OPC results of several circuit layouts. Meanwhile, resist models also significantly affect MBOPC convergence. Two kinds of resist model have been proposed for MBOPC such as constant threshold resist model (CTRM) and variable threshold resist model (VTRM). We propose a novel CTRM, called pattern-based optimal threshold determination (PBOTD). By normalized mean square error (NMSE) formulation, appropriate threshold values with minimum NMSE can be determined to improve image fidelity, and effectively decrease iterations required. The effectiveness of applying both optimized controller and PBOTD is demonstrated on a 90-nm SRAM cell.", "Flare is unwanted light arriving at the wafer and light causing negative impact on pattern formation. It is caused by scattered light from lens surfaces, problem on lens design, or problem on lens manufacture. The impact of flare varies printed line widths or drops CD uniformity accuracy in full chip. And, It is an added incoherent background intensity that will degrade OPC(Optical Proximity Correction) accuracy[1]. In this paper, we discussed CD variation, MEEF (Mask Error Enhancement Factor) and OPC accuracy by the flare effects. Flare is bound up with local pattern density. Local pattern density influences background intensity by flare or stray light. So we studied CD variation, MEEF, OPC modeling data with local pattern density by several experiment. Also, in this study, we will discuss test pattern drawing for OPC modeling data, analyze CD difference between OPC test pattern with considering flare effect and test pattern with regardless flare effect and MEEF value by flare effect. MEEF is main factor that influences lithography process margin. This paper will show test pattern optimization in OPC modeling.", "The development of efficient resist models for optical and process proximity correction (OPC) is a problem of particular importance in microlithography. A resist model is considered efficient if it is fast and accurate and properly accounts for the transfer of latent image patterns into resist shapes. Here we study the runtime-accuracy tradeoff of the Compact Model 1 (CM1) resist model. The model is represented as a linear combination of the aerial image, orthogonal basis functions, and other terms designed to mimic various effects such as acid and base diffusion, slope, maximum and minimum local intensity, etc. Clearly, the greater the number of terms involved the more flexible and accurate the model becomes. On the other hand, adding too many terms to the model substantially increases the OPC runtime and may lead to overfitting. Our goal is to find model forms that are optimal with respect to both runtime and accuracy. This is achieved using a consecutive descent method for multi-objective optimization that seeks so-called Pareto optimal solutions. We found that model forms which include the diffused acid term and orthogonal basis functions almost always represent a reasonable compromise between fitness and performance.", "To avoid expensive immersion lithography and to further use existing dry tools for critical contact layer lithography at 4Xnm DRAM nodes the application of altPSM is investigated and compared to attPSM. Simulations and experiments with several test masks showed that by use of altPSM with suitable 0\u00b0/180\u00b0 coloring and assist placement 30nm smaller contacts can be resolved through pitch with sufficient process windows (PW). This holds for arrays of contacts with variable lengths through short and long side pitches. A further benefit is the lower mask error enhancement factor (MEEF). Nevertheless 3D mask errors (ME) consume benefits in the PW and the assist placement and coloring of the main features (MF) put some constraints on the chip design. An altPSM compatible 4Xnm full-chip layout was realized without loss of chip area. Mask making showed very convincing results with respect to CDU, etch depth uniformity and defectiveness. The printed intra-field CD uniformity was comparable to attPSM despite the smaller target CDs. Room for improvement is identified in OPC accuracy and in automatic assist placement and sizing.", "Patterning trench-hole type of structures with CD in nanometer dimension is very challenging in optical lithography due to limited depth of focus (DOF) and exposure latitude (EL). We have proposed an integration process to convert sub- 100nm line/post type of structure to trench/hole type of structure. The proposed method as well as its variations may have various potential applications, such as formation of plated perpendicular magnetic writer pole, bottom-up nanointerconnect, nano-wires and other out-of-plane nano-structures. We have shown the feasibility for formation of nanotrenches in various sub-100nm dimensions. Magnetic writer pole with 50nm critical dimensions (CD) and wellcontrolled sidewalls was demonstrated by using this approach. The minimum CD of the starting isolated line/post feature determines the minimum CD of the trench/hole structure.", "The extension of optical lithography to 32nm and beyond is dependent on double-patterning (DP) at critical levels. DP integration strategies result in added degrees of freedom for overlay variation. In particular, overlay control requires assessment of error among various mask/level combinations. The Blossom overlay metrology approach minimizes the size of the overlay marks associated with each mask/level while maximizing the density of marks within the overlay metrology tool's field of view (FOV). We examine Blossom enabled use cases in DP lithography control; specifically, within-field and multiple mask/level sampling.", "In modern photolithography as the feature sizes reduce, the simulation of manufacturing process calls on more and more accurate grasp of various effects in the process. While the optical simulation is calculated precisely by both firstprinciple simulators and optical proximity correction (OPC) model simulator, an accurate and computational inexpensive resist model has yet to be developed. After the exposure, resist parameters change the resist part of the proximity effects by either moving the \"optical image\" or responding differently to varying image qualities. By inspecting the wafer data, one can only see the results after development, which is the mixture of optical and resist effects. To isolate the effect contributed by resist, it is necessary to separate the optical component and resist component. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to determine the resist bias from the iso-focal structure, the critical dimension (CD) of which was measured under different defocus conditions. The results extracted from experiments indicate that a constant CD bias can catch most of resist effect at the first order of approximation.", "The impact of bottom reflection on critical dimension (CD) processing window is intensively investigated with a simulation using a full diffraction model (FDM) in which the effective reflectivity is calculated from standing wave amplitude. Most importantly, the optical phase shift of the reflection is used as a design criterion and was found to be the primary factor that affects the UV distribution, and, hence, has a strong impact on exposure latitude and depth of focus. Foot exposure (FE) is introduced as a new metric to characterize the phase shift. Some single-layer and dual-layer bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) designs were implemented with an Exitech MS-193i immersion micro-stepper (NA=1.3) for 45-nm dense lines at the Resist Test Center (RTC) at International SEMATECH, Albany, New York. The experimental results show that FE is closely related to the CD processing window. In contrast to conventional BARC usage, a small amount of substrate reflection with a controlled optical phase shift dramatically improves CD processing window.", "In this paper, it is described in great details how we perform DOE (Design Of Experiments), simulations, narrowing the candidates down, and optimizing them to achieve low COO and large process window RET in 65 nm node nested-hole patterning. We are trying to find best condition of 65 nm tech node nested hole with dry ArF lithography process, regarding porcess cost redcution and easy access to RETs.", "The industry is facing a major challenge looking forward on the technology roadmap with respect to overlay control. Immersion lithography has established itself as the POR for 45nm and for the next few nodes. As the gap closes between scanner capability and device requirements new methodologies need to be taken into consideration. Double patterning lithography is an approach that's being considered for 32 and below, but it creates very strict demands for overlay performance. The fact that a single layer device will need to be patterned using two sequential single processes creates a strong coupling between the 1st and 2nd exposure. The coupling effect during the double patterning process results in extremely tight tolerances for overlay error and scanner capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to explore a new modeling method to improve lithography performance for the 32nm node. Not necessarily unique for double patterning, but as a general approach to improve overlay performance regardless of which patterning process is implemented. We will achieve this by performing an in depth source of variance analysis of current scanner performance and project the anticipated improvements from our new modeling approach. Since the new modeling approach will involve 2nd and 3rd order corrections we will also provide and analysis that outlines current metrology capabilities and sampling optimizations to further expand the opportunities of an efficient implementation of such approach.", "Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) is a patterning technique that uses CVD spacers formed adjacent to a core (template) pattern that is defined by conventional lithography. After stripping the core (template) material, the spacers serve as a hardmask with double the line density of the original lithographically defined template. This integration scheme is an alternative to conventional double patterning for extending the half-pitch resolution beyond the current lithography tool's half-pitch limit. Using a positive tone (spacer as mask) approach, we show capability to create 22nm line and space arrays, on 300mm wafers, with full wafer critical dimension uniformity (CDU) < 2nm (3 sigma) and line edge roughness (LER) < 2nm. These 22nm line and space results stem from template lithography using 1.2NA 193nm water immersion lithography. In this paper, we also demonstrate lot to lot manufacturability, the patterning of two substrate types (STI and silicon oxide trench), as well as demonstrate the formation of gridded design rule (GDR) building blocks for circuit design.", "Scaling of designs to the 45nm and future nodes presents challenges for block level lithography. Shrinking distances between devices drive aggressive resist placement tolerances, challenging the ability to control critical dimension (CD). In particular, the potential variation in shallow trench isolation oxide may result in variation of resist profile and CD, thereby affecting edge placement accuracy. Potential sources of this include wafer-to-wafer or within-wafer STI trench depth variations, and STI CMP variations that may be induced by active area pattern density fluctuations. Some other potential sources of CD fluctuation include oxide sidewall variation, and implant level overlay or CD errors modulating the proximity to the oxide sidewall. Depending on the actual variation of isolation oxide and the exposure latitude of the resist, the CD variations simply from oxide variation may consume a large portion of the CD budget. Several examples are given of variations in resist profile and CD arising from these substrate effects. The CD uniformity of a test structure was shown to decrease dramatically with the addition of a BARC to the resist stack, most likely due to the suppression of substrate reflectivity variations. Simulations performed using Panoramic Technologies software demonstrated the potential sensitivity of the factors outlined above on CD and profile errors. A comparison of simulated vs. experimental results is made for a case of intentional overlay error, showing the failure mode of the resist profile as the mask edge passes from STI to the active area. The simulations using a full physical model provided with the simulation software predict a resist foot forming over the active area, which was confirmed experimentally.", "The pattern deformation such as photoresist lifting after lithography due to not enough photoresist adhesion to substrate is become critical issue when aspect ratio is much higher than what photoresist adhesion can support. This aspect ratio is getting higher when our design rule of device requests smaller feature size in lithography process. The BARC (Bottom Antireflective Coating), which advanced lithography is using, is very good layer to improve adhesion of photoresist since they are same kind of chemical. However, BARC needs extra etching process before main etching which is step to remove substrate. Sometimes, this BARC etching step generated defects which makes yield loss. Especially, lithography step for metallization with aluminum likes without BARC process to be free from those defect. We think that adhesion of photoresist on metal substrate such as aluminum or TiN is very important to develop lithography process without BARC. The adhesion change between photoresist and metal substrate will be changed as function of how we apply pretreatments for metal substrate. The typical pretreatments before patterning are dry ash, wet cleaning and HMDS treatment. In this paper, we study that adhesion changes as function of pretreatments and their mechanism. To understand the interaction between photoresist and substrate, we analyze surface change of wafers which prepared with several different experimental conditions using XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and Dynamic Contact Angle Analyzer. The results will explain how photoresist adhesion may be changed with different pretreatment conditions and how we can optimize process condition to improve photoresist adhesion without BARC.", "As feature size continuously decreasing new techniques to improve quality of wafer are developed. Hence a lot of new problems in semiconductor industry arise. Strict control of quality of wafer during production process is very important as many factors can influence on it, but the main contribution gives scanner error and mask. Thus at least impact of mask should be reduced. In this work we apply rigorous model to predict impact of microstructures to pattern fidelity on wafer. Such microstructures are commonly generated in quartz layer to control transmittance distribution on photomask. It is shown that effect from microstructures is not only changing of mask transmittance but also distortion of the pattern fidelity on wafer. Rigorous modeling gives us possibility to calculate aerial image and CD on wafer in case of presence of microstructures in the quartz. We vary optical parameters, such as refractive indexes, number, size and location of these elements in order to reduce the distortion of pattern fidelity on wafer. Our result allows prediction of the impact of microstructures in photomask on wafer pattern fidelity instead of doing set of experiments. Moreover, the best conditions for experiment are found and discussed.", "With the introduction of the TWINSCAN XT:1900Gi the limit of the water based hyper-NA immersion lithography has been reached in terms of resolution. With a numerical aperture of 1.35 a single expose resolution of 36.5nm half pitch has been demonstrated. However the practical resolution limit in production will be closer to 40nm half pitch, without having to go to double patterning alike strategies. In the relentless Flash memory market the performance of the exposure tool is stretched to the limit for a competitive advantage and cost-effective product. In this paper we will present the results of an experimental study of the resolution limit of the NAND-Flash Memory Gate layer for a production-worthy process on the TWINSCAN XT:1900Gi. The entire gate layer will be qualified in terms of full wafer CD uniformity, aberration sensitivities for the different wordlines and feature-center placement errors for 38, 39, 40 and 43nm half pitch design rule. In this study we will also compare the performance of a binary intensity mask to a 6% attenuated phase shift mask and look at strategies to maximize Depth of Focus, and to desensitize the gate layer for lens aberrations and placement errors. The mask is one of the dominant contributors to the CD uniformity budget of the flash gate layer. Therefore the wafer measurements are compared to aerial image measurements of the mask using AIMSTM 45-193i to separate the mask contribution from the scanner contribution to the final imaging performance.", "As the Rayleigh equations already tell us, improvements in imaging resolution often come at the price of a depth-offocus loss. Often we balance the resolution versus DoF dilemma without regard of the imaging layers location in the overall film stack. E.g. often several via or metal layers are processed with the same optical settings despite facing different amount of depth-of-focus requirements. In actuality, however, substrate induced focus variation can vary greatly from layers at the bottom of a film stack to the layers higher up in the film stack. In the age of super-low k1 lithography this variance needs to be taken into account on a layer specific basis when evaluating the resolution versus DoF tradeoff. We have studied substrate induced focus variation for a 45nm technology test-site as function of film stack sequence and spatial frequency, combining various measurement techniques into an overall topography spectrum. These techniques include data extraction from the exposure tools optical leveling sensor, a mechanical air gauge to calibrate the former and interferometric profiling tools. As a result, we can quantify our DoF requirement for a given layer and product and use this information to optimize our process design on a layer-by-layer basis. This work was performed by the Research Alliance Teams at various IBM Research and Development Facilities", "According to the ITRS roadmap, low k1 imaging requires extremely tight control of Critical Dimension (CD). Maintaining the same performance from one exposure to another for new imaging requirements has become increasingly important, particularly for matching dry and wet systems. Tool to tool CD matching depends on many factors, for example, lens aberrations, partial coherence, laser spectral bandwidth and short range flare. We have performed a detailed study of laser bandwidth effects on tool CD matching for typical 65nm node structures exposed on immersion ArF scanners. A high accuracy on-board spectrometer was used to characterize the lithography Laser bandwidth, allowing measurements of both the FWHM and E95 parameters of the laser spectrum. Spectral bandwidth was adjusted over a larger range than normally experienced during wafer exposures using Cymer's Tunable Advanced Bandwidth Stabilization device (T-ABS) to provide controlled changes in bandwidth while maintaining all other laser performance parameters within specification. Measurements of both Lines and Contact Holes on 65nm node structures through all pitches were made and correlated with bandwidth to determine the sensitivity of IDB and C/H to bandwidth variation. We demonstrated that bandwidth can be adjusted for CD matching on different tool using the T-ABS function.", "In this paper we performed an analysis of various data collection preformed on C045 production lots in order to assess the influence of STI oxide layers on the CD uniformity of implant photolithography layers. Our final purpose is to show whether the DOSE MAPPERTM software option for interfiled dose correction available on ASML scanners combined with a run-to-run feed-forward regulation loop could improve global CD uniformity on C045 implants layers. After a brief presentation of the C045 implants context the results of the analysis are presented : swing curves, process windows analysis, and intra-die CD measurements are presented. The conclusion of the analysis is that it is not possible, in the current C045 industrial environment, to use a robust and general method of interfield dose correction in order to achieve a better global CD uniformity.", "Use of specially designed reticle SMIF pods (RSPs) - with unique purge flow, internal dual-capture mechanism purifiers and an ultra-low humidity CDA purging system- have provided a practical solution to eliminate reticle haze for the useful life of the reticle in production environments. Prior publications, Kishkovich et al., described newly understood mechanisms of reticle haze formation based on chemical modification of quartz and chrome surfaces and have proposed solutions based on continual purge of the reticle environment with ultra-low humidity purified air [1]. In further publications they reported successful application of this solution in the field on single reticle-pod purge systems. [2] In this paper we provide guidance and advice for high volume manufacturing haze control practitioners, describing some challenges and solutions implemented on reticle stocker equipment, including considerations for materials of construction, purge flow levels and regulation, in-pod moisture/chemical purifiers, and on-tool flow measurement techniques.", "The immersion fluid in the lens - wafer gap of advanced lithography scanners has the propensity to be a transport media for imaging defects. A great deal of effort has been devoted to understanding and eliminating the root causes of patterned defects in immersion lithography. Characterization of patterned and unpatterned defects on the wafer top surface has helped to drive improvements in lithography equipment, processes and materials design that subsequently enabled immersion defect density levels to be commensurate with dry lithography. This has enabled the insertion of immersion lithography into mainstream manufacturing. However, the \"ever improving\" yield impetus drives the need to search for and eliminate defect sources beyond the conventional top surface. This paper describes progress in extending these efforts to and beyond the wafer's edge.", "Nowadays, high end photomasks are usually patterned with electron beam writers since they provide a superior resolution. However, placement accuracy is severely limited by the so-called charging effect: Each shot with the electron beam deposits charges inside the mask blank which deflect the electrons in the subsequent shots and therefore cause placement errors. In this paper, a model is proposed which allows to establish a prediction of the deflection of the beam and thus provide a method for improving pattern placement for photomasks.", "With the push toward the 32nm node, OPC modeling must respond in kind with additional accuracy enhancements. One area of lithographic modeling that has basically gone unchecked is mask fidelity. Mask linearity is typically built into the OPC model since the calibration data contain this information, but mask pattern fidelity is almost impossible to quantify for OPC modeling. Mask fidelity is the rounding and smoothing of the mask features relative to the post-OPC layout intent, and there is no robust metric available to quantify these effects. With the introduction of contour-based model calibration, mask fidelity modeling is possible. This work evaluates techniques to quantify mask modeling and methods to gauge the accuracy improvement that mask fidelity modeling would project into the lithographic process using contour-based mask model calibration.", "To enable development of novel signal processing circuits, a high-speed surface-channel charge coupled device (CCD) process has been co-integrated with the Lincoln Laboratory 180-nm RF fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS technology. The CCDs support charge transfer clock speeds in excess of 1 GHz while maintaining high charge transfer efficiency (CTE). Both the CCD and CMOS gates are formed using a single-poly process, with CCD gates isolated by a narrow phase-shift-defined gap. CTE is strongly dependent on tight control of the gap critical dimension (CD). In this paper we review the tradeoffs encountered in the co-integration of the CCD and CMOS technologies. The effect of partial coherence on gap resolution and pattern fidelity is discussed. The impact of asymmetric bias due to phase error and phase shift mask (PSM) sidewall effects is presented, along with adopted mitigation strategies. Issues relating to CMOS pattern fidelity and CD control in the double patterning process are also discussed. Since some signal processing CCD structures involve two-dimensional transfer paths, many required geometries present phase compliance and trim engineering challenges. Approaches for implementing non-compliant geometries, such as T shapes, are described, and the impact of various techniques on electrical performance is discussed.", "Making a sub-32 nm line and space pattern is the most important issue in semiconductor process. Specially, it is important to make line and space pattern when the device type is NAND flash memory because the unit cell is mostly composed of line and space pattern. Double patterning method is regarded as the most promising technology for sub-32 nm half-pitch node. However, double patterning method is expensive for the production and heavy data split is required. In order to make cheaper and easier patterning, we suggest a resist reflow process (RRP) method for 32 nm 1:1 line and space pattern. It is easier to make 1:3 pitch than 1:1 pitch line and space in terms of aerial image, and RRP can make 1:3 pitch aerial image to 1:1 resist image. We used home-made RRP simulation based on Navier-Stokes equation including surface tension effect. Solid-E is used for optical simulation, and e-beam lithography is used for the experiment to check the concept.", "In principle, the dose should not be changed to make the same linewidth if a perfect anti-reflection coating (ARC) is used for all the sublayers underneath the resist. However, the optimum dose for different sublayers and thicknesses are different even though perfect ARC is used. The post exposure bake (PEB) process of a chemically amplified resist is one of the key processes to make very small features of semiconductor device. The photo-generated acid makes the deprotection of protected polymer, and this deprotection highly depends on the PEB temperature and time. The diffusion length of acid is also strongly dependent on PEB temperature and time. As the linewidth of the device decreases, smaller diffusion length is required to reduce the roughness of the line edge and width. One of the key factors to determine the deprotection and acid diffusion is the initial temperature rising and the final real temperature inside the resist. The unpredictable temperature rising to the pre-set temperature mainly causes the variation of linewidth and the optimum dose. In order to predict the accurate PEB temperature and time dependency of the linewidth and dose, the heat transfer from the hot plate to the resist on the top of the multiply stacked sublayers over the silicon wafer has to be known since the reaction and diffusion occur inside the resist, not on the top of the bare silicon wafer. We studied heat transfer from the hot plate to the top of the resist including conductivity and thickness of each sublayer. For this purpose, a novel numerical approach incorporated with analytic method was proposed to solve the heat conduction problem. The unknowns for temperature are located only at the interfaces between layers, so that it is fast and efficient. We calculated the time that is consumed for the resist to attain the prescribed PEB temperature for the different multi stacks and thicknesses. Calculation shows that the temperature rising is different and final temperature on top of the resist is also different for various sublayers and thicknesses of theirs including resist itself. Experiment by us and others also clearly show that there is a definite temperature difference between on top of the bare wafer and on top of the resist. The effects for the different layer stacks and thicknesses are investigated to obtain proper dose and linewidth control due to different actual resist PEB temperature.", "New concepts about transistor structure are being introduced for sub-50nm memory products. As the memory cell design is shrinking down, conventional transistor of planar structure can not guarantee safe transistor operation. Newly introduced transistor has to ensure robust transistor operation characteristics and process stability simultaneously. One of the candidates which are being developed recently is vertical transistor. The basic layout to integrate vertical transistor include very dense 2-dimensional features. The new memory cell based on dense structure can also contribute to reduction of cell area compared to conventional memory cell such as 8F2 planar cell. While new memory structure enables the reduction of chip size, its 2-dimensional structure limits resolving performance of optical lithography inevitably. It is very challenging to build 4F2 dense features of sub-50nm node by single exposure technology using hyper NA ArF lithography before the EUV era. In this paper, the feasibility of 2-dimensional dense structure at 50nm node is presented and various techniques are introduced to realize new memory scheme as next generation memory cell structure.", "As the industry extends immersion lithography to the 32 nm node, the limits of image and resist contrast will be challenged. Image contrast is limited by the inherent numerical aperture of a water based immersion lithography system. Elements of resist design and processing can further degrade the final deprotected image contrast1,2. Studies have been done to understand the effects of image contrast on line width roughness (LER) for dry 193 nm lithography3. This paper focuses on the impacts of image and resist contrast on the formation of defects and LER in an immersion lithography process. Optical and resist simulations are combined with experiments to better understand the relationship between image quality, resist design, scanner/track processing and defect formation. The goal of this work is to develop a relationship between resist contrast metrics and defect formation for immersion processes.", "This paper describes the qualification work performed on a state-of-the-art immersion cluster and shows results for an immersion process for the 45nm node. These results demonstrate full compliance with all lithographic parameters, including CD control and defectivity. Qualification was performed on an RF3iTM wafer track from Sokudo Co., Ltd. and a 1.2NA immersion scanner. A three-layer material stack was engineered using 820\u00c5 BARC / 1800\u00c5 ArF photoresist covered by 900\u00c5 immersion top-coat. After verification of tool and process cleanliness and testing the robustness of the material stack for use in the immersion scanner, resulting photo cell monitor (PCM) defect density on a 65nm memory device was evaluated. Critical dimension was verified using both CD-SEM and optical CD metrology. Results on a 45nm L/S pattern showed 0.55nm WIW 3sigma CD uniformity using optical CD metrology. Lot to lot CD control was tested for being below 1.5nm 3sigma. As special Soak-units were used prior to post exposure bake (PEB), the influence of post exposure delay (PED) on the CD performance was studied and quantified. All immersion-related modules were optimized and qualified on both 65nm products and 45nm prototypes. Additionally, comparison data for immersion and dry lithography will be presented.", "The traditional Hopkins based microlithography aerial image simulation methods most likely require expensive 4D Singular Value Decomposition operations to obtain mutually incoherent kernels. This is often a problem when the requirement of resolution is high especially when sub-resolution assist features are present. During the process development and model fitting, kernels are required to generate frequently. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is not necessary to perform this expensive task to generate those kernels. By taking advantage of several classical matrix theories, we are able to directly extract kernels without resorting to 4D Singular Value Decomposition operations. The accuracy and efficiency will be extensively studied in the experimental results.", "Coupled eigenmode (CEM) theory for TM polarized illumination is presented and applied to the 3D modeling of a linespace reticle. In this approach, the electric and magnetic field inside a line-space reticle is described in terms of an orthogonal set of eigenmodes of Maxwell's equations. The diffraction of light by the reticle can then be expressed as a coherent sum of diffraction orders produced by each eigenmode independently. Fresnel transmission, overlap of eigenmodes with diffraction orders and propagation through the mask are shown to be the interactions that determine the complex amplitude of the diffraction orders produced by each mode. We further shown that only a small number of eigenmodes are needed to accurately calculate image contrast under TM polarized illumination.", "Rigorous computer simulations of propagating electromagnetic fields have become an important tool for optical metrology and design of nanostructured optical components. A vectorial finite element method (FEM) is a good choice for an accurate modeling of complicated geometrical features. However, from a numerical point of view solving the arising system of linear equations is very demanding even for medium sized 3D domains. In numerics, a domain decomposition method is a commonly used strategy to overcome this problem. Within this approach the overall computational domain is split up into smaller domains and interface conditions are used to assure continuity of the electromagnetic field. Unfortunately, standard implementations of the domain decomposition method as developed for electrostatic problems are not appropriate for wave propagation problems. In an earlier paper we therefore proposed a domain decomposition method adapted to electromagnetic field wave propagation problems. In this paper we apply this method to 3D mask simulation.", "In the case of hyper-NA (NA>1) imaging with the lens magnification keeping 1/4, the angle of light incidence on pellicle becomes bigger. For example, it is up to 19 degrees for NA=1.3 lens. It is already known that the effect of multiple reflections of the light inside the pellicle film becomes obvious, in that the effect contains transmission variation across the light incidence angle on the pellicle. For normal pellicle, transmission of oblique incidence light is lower than the normal incidence light and the difference is about 10% as intensity changes. And pellicle thickness error affects the transmission characteristics. Thus, pellicle thickness error causes change of iso-dense bias (or optical proximity effect; OPE) and dense line CD variation. Specs for CD uniformity in below half pitch (hp) 45nm imaging become tighter, and therefore, pellicle should not be a new root cause of CD error. The solutions for the issue are (1) tighter specs for pellicle thickness or (2) selection of optimal pellicle thickness. The latter is more effective for suppressing CD variation across the exposure field than the former. In our paper, we describe the pellicle effect for through-pitch imaging including below hp45 nm dense L/S using hyper-NA lens. We discuss pellicle thickness optimization for better CD uniformity and the results of simulation for some pellicle conditions.", "The introduction of double patterning and double exposure technologies, especially in combination with hyper NA, increases the importance of wafer topography phenomena. Rigorous electromagnetic field (EMF) simulations of two beam interference exposures over non-planar wafers are used to explore the impact of the hardmask material and pattern on resulting linewidths and swing curves after the second lithography step. Moreover, the impact of the optical material contrast between the frozen and unfrozen resist in a pattern freezing process and the effect of a reversible contrast enhancement layer on the superposition of two subsequent lithographic exposures are simulated. The described simulation approaches can be used for the optimization of wafer stack configurations for double patterning and to identify appropriate optical material properties for alternative double patterning and double exposure techniques.", "In this paper, we demonstrate how a direct coupling of a lithography simulation program and a semiconductor device simulation tool can be used to investigate the impact of lithographic process variations on nano-scaled CMOS devices. In contrast to conventional evaluation criteria such as process windows, mask error enhancement factor (MEEF), or CD (critical dimension) uniformity, the lithography process is regarded in a more holistic fashion as a means to an end. As a consequence, the ultimate figure of merit is determined by the performance of the device. Lithography simulations are conducted using a rigorous EMF solver for the computation of the mask nearfield. TCAD process and device simulations are performed for an ultra thinned body fully depleted silicon on insulator (UTB FD-SOI) nMOSFET, with a physical gate length of 32 nm. Electrical parameters such as on- and off- current, threshold voltage, sub-threshold slope, gate-capacitance, and contact resistances are computed and extracted. The impact of lithographic process variations on the electrical behavior of the target device is surveyed and illustrated. Moreover, we present an adjusted lithography process window defined by the electrical behavior of the device. In addition to a discussion of the obtained results, this paper also focuses on the software design aspects of interfacing a lithography simulation environment with a device simulator. The steps involved in extracting parameters and transferring them from one program to the other are explained, and further automation capabilities are suggested. Moreover, it is illustrated how this approach can be extended towards an integrated litho/device process optimization procedure.", "This paper proposes a new design check system that works in three steps. First, hotspots such as pinching/bridging are recognized in a product layout based on thorough process simulations. Small layout snippets centered on hotspots are clipped from the layout and similarities between these snippets are calculated by computing their overlapping areas. This is accomplished using an efficient, rectangle-based algorithm. The snippet overlapping areas can be weighted by a function derived from the optical parameters of the lithography process. Second, these hotspots are clustered using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Finally, each cluster is analyzed in order to identify the common cause of failure for all the hotspots in that cluster, and its representative pattern is fed to a pattern-matching tool for detecting similar hotspots in new design layouts. Thus, the long list of hotspots is reduced to a small number of meaningful clusters and a library of characterized hotspot types is produced. This could lead to automated hotspot corrections that exploit the similarities of hotspots occupying the same cluster. Such an application will be the subject of a future publication.", "As design rules continue to shrink beyond the lithography wavelength, pattern printability becomes a significant challenge in fabrication for 45nm and beyond. Model-based OPC and DRC checkers have been deployed using metrology data such as CD to fine-tune the model, and to predict and identify potential structures that may fail in a manufacturing environment. For advanced technology nodes with tighter process windows, it is increasingly important to validate the models with empirical data from both product and FEM wafers instead of relying solely on traditional metrology and simulations. Furthermore, feeding the information back to designers can significantly reduce the development efforts.", "We present the chip-scale CMP simulator for layer uniformity analysis within Calibre DFM framework. The CMP simulator is intended to be used during smart fill optimizations, accurate parasitic extractions, defocus variability compensations, and other DFM applications. It is tightly integrated with Mentor Graphics DFM components for yield analysis and optimization. The paper discusses the key concepts of the electro-chemical copper deposition and slurry CMP models that are used in the simulation. The data flow is described, including the use of mask information from design layout data. Application examples, including the process flow and the simulated results, are presented. Both the electroplating and the CMP models include empirical parameters that describe the width- and space- dependency. Fast and accurate global optimization search algorithms are implemented to find optimum modeling parameter values.", "For accurate analysis of circuit performance, an understanding on-chip gate length variation is required. Non-systematic OCLV was measured by SEM and the results were analyzed after being divided into local and global factors. Simple empirical models of global and local variations were proposed, and fitting was done. In the fitting, measured mask variation was used, and on-chip variation of focus, dose, and LWR were fitting parameters. The fit of our model was very consistent with experimental result. Prediction of global and local variation using lithographic characters of patterns, such as EL, DOF, and MEEF, was enabled.", "While there are several approaches being pursued to address runtime expectations in model based physical verification with sufficient accuracy against current manufacturing processes1, there is also the need to create models that embed a contract with the designers as to what are the realistic process control limits in a given technology for a particular layout. This is of special importance primarily when the process is still in development so that both design and process development can progress in parallel with a minimum risk of finding that the design does not yield due to poor imaging control due to sub optimal layout configurations. Several ideas are presented as to how target process variability bands can be generated and the limitations of actual process variability bands to meet such constrains. The main problem this work tries to answer is that while Optical Proximity Correction changes may be modified at a future time, the main source of uncertainty is determined by the choice of the selected resolution enhancement technique. To illustrate this point a constant layout is analyzed when applying different resolution enhancement techniques. Single exposure and double patterning results along with their corresponding process variability bands are shown for illustration. This provides an outlook as to how feasible is to provide target bands and if solutions may or may not exist in the future.", "The impact of lithography-induced systematic variations on the parametric behavior of cells and chips designed on a TI 65nm process has been studied using software tools for silicon contour prediction, and design analysis from contours. Using model-based litho and etch simulation at different process conditions, contours were generated for the poly and active layers of standard cells in multiple contexts. Next, the extracted transistor-level SPICE netlists (with annotated changes in CD) were simulated for cell delay and leakage. The silicon contours predicted by the model-based litho tools were validated by comparing CDs of the simulated contours with SEM images. A comparative analysis of standard cells with relaxed design rules and restricted pitch design rules showed that restrictive design rules help reduce the variation from instance to instance of a given cell by as much as 15%, but at the expense of an area penalty. A full-chip variability analysis flow, including model-based lithography and etch simulation, captures the systematic variability effects on timing-critical paths and cells and allows for comparison of the variability of different cells and paths in the context of a real design.", "Dimensions for 32nm generation logic are expected to be ~45nm. Even with high NA scanners, the k1 factor is below 0.32. Gridded-design-rules (GDR) are a form of restricted design rules (RDR) and have a number of benefits from design through fabrication. The combination of rules and topologies can be verified during logic technology development, much as is done with memories. Topologies which have been preverified can be used to implement random logic functions with \"hotspot\" prevention that is virtually context-independent. Mask data preparation is simplified with less aggressive OPC, resulting in shorter fracturing, writing, and inspection times. In the wafer fab, photolithography, etch, and CMP are more controllable because of the grating-like patterns. Tela CanvasTM GDR layout was found to give smaller area cells than a conventional 2D layout style. Variability and context independence were also improved.", "The design challenges associated with alternating phase shifted mask lithography are discussed, solutions which had been developed to address these challenges are reviewed, and parallels to current design for manufacturability implementation issues are identified. Leveraging these insights, the positive attributes of a well integrated design for manufacturability enhanced design flow are proposed. Specific topics covered in the paper are: the need to complement error-detection with streamlined layout-correction, the risk of providing too much unstable information too early in the design optimization flow, the efficiencies of prescriptive 'correct-by-construction' solutions, and the need for seamless integration into existing design flows. For the benefit of the non-lithographer, the discussion of these detailed topics is preceded by a brief review of alternating phase shifted mask lithography principles and benefits.", "If the minimum die area is the main objective of an ASIC application, then each critical layer will have bi-directional mask layout. Then advanced litho technology is required to print the layers with single exposure lithography. If however yield, electrical robustness and variability have higher priority than minimum die area, than unidirectional patterning can be a good alternative. However, then the bi-directional layout of, especially the active area- and gate-layer, must be redesigned in an unidirectional layout (at the expense of a larger cell-area). Moreover, if a design split in two orthogonal unidirectional layouts can be made then the so-called cut-mask technology can be used: this is a (well-known) double patterning technology. This paper discusses three different cut-mask compatible redesigns of the gate-layer of a complex flip-flop cell, to be used in robust, low-cost low-power CMOS-logic applications with 45 nm ground rules and 180 nm device pitches. The analogue circuit simulator from Cadence has been used. The results obtained with ASML's lithography simulator, \"Litho Cruiser\", show that cut-mask patterning gives superior CD- and end-of-line control and enables Design Rules with less Gate-Overlap. This again gives the circuit-designer more design freedom for choosing the transistor width. Furthermore, the cut-mask compatible layouts can even be processed with high-NA dry KrFlithography instead of advanced single exposure ArFi lithography. The designs are compared with a reference design which is a traditional minimum area design with bi-directional layout.", "Design rule (DR) development strategies were fairly straightforward at earlier technology nodes when node-on-node scaling could be accommodated easily by reduction of \u03bb/NA. For more advanced nodes, resolution enhancement technologies such as off-axis illumination and sub-resolution assist features have become essential for achieving full shrink entitlement, and DR restrictions must be implemented to comprehend the inherent limitations of these techniques (e.g., forbidden pitches) and the complex and unanticipated 2D interactions that arise from having a large number of random geometric patterns within the optical ambit. To date, several factors have limited the extent to which 2D simulations could be used in the DR development cycle, including exceedingly poor cycle time for optimizing OPC and SRAF placement recipes per illumination condition, prohibitively long simulation time for characterizing the lithographic process window on large 2D layouts, and difficulty in detecting marginal lithographic sites using simulations based on discrete cut planes. We demonstrate the utility of the inverse lithography technology technique [1] to address these limitations in the novel context of restrictive DR development and design for manufacturability for the 32nm node. Using this technique, the theoretically optimum OPC and SRAF treatment for each layout are quickly and automatically generated for each candidate illumination condition, thereby eliminating the need for complex correction and placement recipes. \"Ideal\" masks are generated to explore physical limits and subsequently \"Manhattanized\" in accordance with mask rules to explore realistic process limits. Lithography process window calculations are distributed across multiple compute cores, enabling rapid full-chip-level simulation. Finally, pixel-based image evaluation enables hot-spot detection at arbitrary levels of resolution, unlike the 'cut line' approach. We have employed the ILT technique to explore forbidden-pitch contact hole printing in random logic. Simulations from cells placed in random context are used to evaluate the effectiveness of restricting pitches in contact hole design rules. We demonstrate how this simulation approach may not only accelerate the design rule development cycle, but also may enable more flexibility in design by revealing overly restrictive rules, or reduce the amount of hot-spot fixing required later in the design phase by revealing where restrictions are needed.", "The growing impact of process variation on circuit performance requires statistical design approaches in which circuits are designed and optimized subject to an estimated variation. Previous work [1] has explicitly accounted for variation and spatial correlations by including extra margins in each of the gate delay and correlation factor between path delays. However, as it is recently shown, what is often referred to as \"spatial correlation\" is an artifact of un-modeled residuals after the decomposition of deterministic variation components across the wafer and across the die [2]. Consequently, a more accurate representation of process variability is to introduce these deterministic variability components in the model, and therefore generate any apparent spatial correlation as the artifact of those deterministic components, just like in the actual process. This approach is used to re-size an 8-bit Ladner-Fischer adder. The optimized circuit delay distribution is obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. A layout generation tool is also being constructed to incorporate the optimization procedure into the standard design flow. Custom circuit layouts are first subjected to design rules to extract constraints that specify the margins allowed for each transistor active area edge movement. Sizing optimization is then performed with design rule constraints taken into account. A new circuit layout is generated based on the optimization results and checked to ensure DRC cleanness. The optimized layout can be subjected to further verification such as hotspot detection to account for any additional layout dependant effects.", "Disconnection between design and manufacturing has become a prevalent issue in modern VLSI processes. As manufacturability becomes a major concern, uncertainties from process variation and complicated rules have increased the design cost exponentially. Numerous design methodologies for manufacturability have been proposed to improve the yield. In deep submicron designs, optical proximity correction (OPC) and fill insertion have become indispensable for chip fabrication. In this paper, we propose a novel method to use these manufacturing techniques to optimize the design. We can effectively implement non-uniform wire sizing and achieve substantial performance and power improvement with very low costs on both design and manufacturing sides. The proposed method can reduce up to 42% power consumption without any delay penalty. It brings minor changes to the current design flow and no extra cost for fabrication.", "With the increased need for low power applications, designers are being forced to employ circuit optimization methods that make tradeoffs between performance and power. In this paper, we propose a novel transistor-level optimization method. Instead of drawing the transistor channel as a perfect rectangle, this method involves reshaping the channel to create an optimized device that is superior in both delay and leakage to the original device. The method exploits the unequal drive and leakage current distributions across the transistor channel to find an optimal non-rectangular shape for the channel. In this work we apply this technique to circuit-level leakage reduction. By replacing every transistor in a circuit with its optimally shaped counterpart, we achieve 5% savings in leakage on average for a set of benchmark circuits, with no delay penalty. This improvement is achieved without any additional circuit optimization iterations, and is well suited to fit into existing design flows.", "Particle induced defects are still one of the major sources of yield loss in semiconductor manufacturing. In addition, optical distortion of shapes cannot be ignored in modern technologies and requires increasing design effort in order to avoid yield loss and minimize manufacturing costs. Although suppliers of automated routing tools are increasingly addressing these issues, we still see significant improvement potential even in layouts produced by routers attributed as DfM aware. We propose a post-routing clean-up step to address both defect and lithography related yield loss in the routing layers. In contrast to a \"find and fix\" approach, this methodology creates lithography friendly layout \"by construction\", based on the general concept of shape simplification and standardization.", "Yield loss due to process variations can be classified as catastrophic or parametric. Parametric variations can further be random or systematic in nature. Systematic parametric variations are being projected as a major yield limiter in sub- 65nm technologies. Though several models exist to describe process-induced parametric effects in layouts, there is no existing design methodology to study the variational (across process window) impact of all these effects simultaneously. In this paper, we present a methodology for analyzing multiple process-induced systematic and statistical layout dependent effects on circuit performance. We describe physical design models used to describe four major sources of parametric variability - lithography, stress, etch and contact resistance - and their impact on device properties. We then develop a methodology to determine variability in circuit performance based on integrating the above device models with a circuit simulator like SPICE. A circuit simulation engine for 45nm SOI devices is implemented, which shows the extent of the impact of layout-dependent systematic variations on circuit parameters like delay and power. Based on the analysis, we demonstrate that all systematic effects need to be simultaneously included to match the hardware data. We believe a flow that is capable of understanding process-induced parametric variability will have major advantages in terms of improving physical design and yield in addition to reducing design to hardware miscorrelations and advantages in terms of diagnosis and silicon debug.", "Increasing memory array sizes and low operating voltages in modern ICs expose the IC to extremely low failure rates of single memory cells. The failure probability is affected by variations in the process of IC fabrication, which yield varying transistor parameters. This may cause an erratic certification of designs that may have a low production yield. VARAN relies on analytical methods that yield controlled precision calculations involving a minimum of circuit simulation. Furthermore, VARAN is equipped with a built-in sensitivity analysis mechanism that can guide the designer as to which parameters are significant for robust design. The flow starts by setting a circuit simulation infrastructure. Each simulation returns a value of fail or pass for a given set of circuit parameters (i.e. transistor size) and environmental parameters. The probability of failure is calculated by integration over the design parameter space. VARAN uses a novel response surface modeling (RSM) to reduce the number of simulations that are needed for low probability calculations. The RSM relies on an adaptive fitting, which is capable of modeling intricate behaviors which require many parameters using ordinary polynomial modeling, with a minimal number of terms. VARAN was tested over synthetic and real circuit data yielding extremely low failure probabilities.", "Leveraging silicon validation, a model-based variability analysis has been implemented to detect sensitivity to systematic variations in standard cell libraries using a model-based solution, to reduce performance spread at the cell level and chip level. First, a simulation methodology to predict changes in circuit characteristics due to systematic lithography and etch effects is described and validated in silicon. This methodology relies on these two foundations: 1) A physical shape model predicts contours from drawn layout; 2) An electrical device model, which captures narrow width effects, accurately reproduces drive currents of transistors based on silicon contours. The electrical model, combined with accurate lithographic contour simulation, is used to account for systematic variations due to optical proximity effects and to update an existing circuit netlist to give accurate delay and leakage calculations. After a thorough validation, the contour-based simulation is used at the cell level to analyze and reduce the sensitivity of standard cells to their layout context. Using a random context generation, the contour-based simulation is applied to each cell of the library across multiple contexts and litho process conditions, identifying systematic shape variations due to proximity effects and process variations and determining their impact on cell delay. This methodology is used in the flow of cell library design to identify cells with high sensitivity to proximity effects and consequently, large variation in delay and leakage. The contour-based circuit netlist can also be used to perform accurate contour-based cell characterization and provide more silicon-accurate timing in the chip-design flow. A cell-variability index (CVI) can also be derived from the cell-level analysis to provide valuable information to chip-level design optimization tools to reduce overall variability and performance spread of integrated circuits at 65nm and below.", "With increasing chip sizes and shrinking device dimensions, on-chip semiconductor process variation can no longer be ignored in the design and signoff static timing analysis of integrated circuits. An important parameter affecting CMOS technologies is the gate length (Lgate) of a transistor. In modern technologies, significant spatial intra-chip variability of transistor gate lengths, which is systematic as opposed to random, can lead to relatively large variations in circuit path delays. Spatial variations in Lgate affect circuit timing properties, which can lead to timing errors and performance loss. To maximize performance and process utilization in microprocessor designs, we have developed and validated a timing analysis methodology based on accurate silicon contour prediction from drawn layout and contour-based extraction of our designs. This allows for signoff timing without unnecessarily large margins, thereby reducing chip area and maximizing performance while ensuring chip functionality, improved process utilization and yield. In this paper, we describe the chip timing methodology, its validation and implementation in microprocessor design.", "This paper applies process and circuit simulation to examine plausible explanations for measured differences in ring oscillator frequencies and to develop layout and electronic circuit concepts that have increased sensitivity to lithographic parameters. Existing 90nm ring oscillator test chip measurements are leveraged, and the performance of ring oscillator circuit is simulated across the process parameter variation space using HSPICE and the Parametric Yield Simulator in the Collaborative Platform for DfM. These simulation results are then correlated with measured ring oscillator frequencies to directly extract the variation in the underlying parameter. Hypersensitive gate layouts are created by combining the physical principles in which the effects of illumination, focus, and pattern geometry interact. Using these principles and parametric yield simulations, structures that magnify the focus effects have been found. For example, by using 90\u00b0 phase shift probe, parameter-specific layout monitors are shown to be five times more sensitive to focus than that of an isolated line. On the design side, NMOS or PMOS-specific electrical circuits are designed, implemented, and simulated in HSPICE.", "In this paper, we propose the novel method quantifying impacts of lithography hot spots to chip yield with lithography simulation. Our method consists of three steps. Firstly, lithography simulation is done under several conditions including process variations, exposure dose and focus, for example. Hot spots are recognized through the results of simulations and those critical dimensions (CD) are derived. Secondly, a failure rate is calculated under a process parameter at each hot spot, respectively. Assuming the distribution of wafer CD from simulated CD, a differential failure rate on a process parameter is calculated with integrating the probability that wafer CD is less than a lower limit. Also probability that process condition is equal to the process parameter is defined from a distribution of process parameter. Finally, individual failure rate of the hot spot is calculated by summing the products of the differential failure rate and the probabilities of process parameter. Systematic yield is calculating with multiplying the differences of the individual failure rate from unity, providing that all hot spots are fully individual. An advantage of this method is that the defect probability of hot spot is calculated independently from each other and systematic yield can be easily estimated regardless of layout size, from primitive cell to full chip.", "To ensure the continuation of the scaling of VLSI circuits for years to come, the impact of litho on performance of logic circuits has to be understood. Using different litho options such as single or double patterning may result in different process variations. This paper evaluates the impact of litho variations on the yield of SRAM cells. The exploration is focused on six transistor SRAM cells (6T SRAM) which have to be printed with the highest possible density with good yield to limit system's cost. Consequently, these cells impose the most stringent constraints on litho techniques. An SRAM cell is yielding if it operates correctly like a memory device (functional yield) and the performance of the cell is in spec for the chosen architecture (parametric yield). In this paper, different metrics for the stability, readability and write-ability are used to define parametric yield. The most important litho-induced variations are illumination dose, focus, overlay mismatch and line-edge roughness. Unwanted opens and shorts in the printed patterns caused by the process variations will cause the cell to malfunction. These litho-induced variations also cause dimension offsets, i.e. variations on transistors' widths and lengths, which reduces the stability, readability and write-ability of the cell, thereby increasing parametric yield loss. Litho simulators are coupled with a device parasitic extractor to simulate the impact of the litho offsets on the yield of the SRAM cell. Based on these simulations guidance will be provided on the choice between different litho options.", "Electrically testable structures (such as serpentines for testing opens and serpentine/combs for testing shorts) with varying post-OPC dimensions have been incorporated into test reticles, which were then used to process wafers through electrical test. Process window OPC verification was run on the same structures, thus allowing correlation of electrical yield to OPC-verification results. By combining OPC verification results with probability of occurrence for the various process conditions used in OPC verification, a predicted yield can be calculated. Comparisons of electrical yield to predicted yield are used to demonstrate a methodology for verifying (or setting) failure limits. Although, in general, the correlation between electrical and predicted yield is reasonable, various issues have been identified which impact this correlation, and make the task of accurately predicting yield difficult. These issues are discussed in detail in this paper.", "The evolution of high-NA projection optics design and manufacturing tolerances has been remarkable in recent years. Nevertheless, different instances of identical scanner models can still exhibit unique optical fingerprints which can impart subtle patterning differences for a given mask exposed at nominally identical conditions on different scanners. In some cases, a product can be shown statistically to yield lower when a certain layer is exposed on a particular scanner. Thus it is common to have a certain subset of the total population of tools allowed for certain critical levels, such as gate. Since a single mask is typically shared between the multiple allowed scanners, the optical proximity correction model which is employed in the generation of that mask must represent the average fingerprint of those tools. In practice, CD data may be collected from multiple tools, but more often a single tool is somehow identified as the \"golden\" tool for the purpose of calibrating the OPC model. Once the mask is generated, however, its printing behavior on multiple scanners can readily be simulated using tool-specific optical models. Such models can be easily generated based upon known optical fingerprint data, such as measured illumination source maps, Jones pupil or Zernike aberration files. This paper investigates the use of tool-specific optical models to elucidate the intersection of design and process variability, which will manifest differently on each scanner, depending upon subtle details of the scanner fingerprint.", "As transistor dimensions become smaller, on-wafer transistor dimension variations, induced by lithography or etching process, impact more to the transistor parameters than those from the earlier process technologies such as 90 nm and 130 nm. The on-wafer transistor dimension variations are layout dependent and are ignored in the standard post layout verification flow where the transistor parameters in a spice netlist are extracted from drawn transistor dimensions. There are commercial software tools for predicting the on-wafer transistor dimensions for the improved accuracy of the post-layout verification. These tools need accurate models for the on-wafer transistor dimension prediction and the models need to be re-calibrated as the fabrication process is changed. Furthermore, the model-based predictions of the on-wafer transistor dimensions require extensive computing power which can be time consuming. In the paper, a procedure to back-annotate the process induced transistor dimension changes into the post layout extracted netlist using a simple look-up table is described. The lookup table is composed of specified drawn transistor and its sounding layout as well as their on-wafer dimensions. The on-wafer dimensions can be extracted from simulations, SEM in-line pictures or electrical data of specially designed testkeys. Taking the lookup table data, accordingly, the transistor dimensions in the post-layout netlist file are then modified by a commercial software tool with a pattern search function. Comparing with the model based approach, the lookup table approach takes much less time for modifying the post-layout netlist. The lookup table approach is flexible, since the tables can be easily updated to reflect the most recent process changes from the foundry. In summary, a lookup table based approach for improving the post-layout verification accuracy is described. This approach can improve the verification accuracy from both litho and non-litho process variations. This approach has been applied to Xilinx's 65 nm and 45 nm product developments.", "GDSII is a data format of the circuit design file for producing semiconductor. GDSII is also used as a transfer format for fabricating photo mask as well. As design rules are getting smaller and RET (Resolution Enhancement Technology) is getting more complicated, the time of converting GDSII to a mask data format has been increased, which influences the period of mask production. Photo mask shops all over the world are widely using computer clusters which are connected through a network, that is, called distributed computing method, to reduce the converting time. Commonly computing resource for conversion is assigned based on the input file size. However, the result of experiments showed that the input file size was improper to predict the computing resource usage. In this paper, we propose the methodology of artificial intelligence with considering the properties of GDSII file to handle circuit design files more efficiently. The conversion time will be optimized by controlling the hardware resource for data conversion as long as the conversion time is predictable through analyzing the design data. Neural networks are used to predict the conversion time for this research. In this paper, the application of neural networks for the time prediction will be discussed and experimental results will be shown with comparing to statistical model based approaches.", "The advanced process technologies have well known yield loss due to the degradation of pattern fidelity. The process to compensate for this problem is advanced resolution enhancement techniques (RET) and optical proximity correction (OPC). By design, the creation of RET/OPC recipes and the calibration of process models are done very early in the process development cycle with data that are not made of real designs since they are not yet available, but made of test structures that represent different sizes, distances and topologies. The process of improving the RET/OPC recipes and models is long and tedious, it is usually a key contributor to quick production ramp-up. It is very coverage limited by design. The authors will present a proposed system that, by design, is dynamic, and allows the RET/OPC production system to reach maturity faster through a detailed collection of hotspots identified at the design stage. The goal is to reduce the lapse of time required to get mature production RET/OPC recipes and models.", "As the feature size of LSI becomes smaller, the increase of mask manufacturing cost is becoming critical. Association of Super-Advanced Electronics Technologies (ASET) started a 4-year project aiming at the reduction of mask manufacturing cost and TAT by the optimization of MDP, mask writing, and mask inspection in 2006 under the sponsorship of New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) [1]. In the project, the optimization is being pursued from the viewpoints of \"common data format\", \"pattern prioritization\", \"repeating patterns\", and \"parallel processing\" in MDP, mask writing, and mask inspection. In the total optimization, \"repeating patterns\" are applied to the mask writing using character projection (CP) and efficient review in mask inspection. In this paper, we describe a new method to find repeating patterns from OPCed layout data after fracturing. We found that using the new method efficient extraction of repeating patterns even from OPCed layout data is possible and shot count of mask writing decreases greatly.", "Lithography compliance check (LCC), which is verification of layouts using lithography simulation, is an essential step under the current low k1 lithography condition. However a conventional LCC scheme does not consider process proximity effect (PPE) differences among several manufacturing tools, especially for exposure tools. In this paper two concepts are proposed. One is PPE monitoring and matching using warmspots. The warmspots are patterns that have small process window. They are sensitive to difference of illumination conditions and are basically 2-dimensional patterns. The other is LCC using multiple simulation models that represent each PPE on exposure tools. All layouts are verified by these models and the layouts are fixed if hotspots (catastrophic failure on wafer) are found. This verification step is repeated until all hotspots are eliminated from the layouts. Based on these concepts, robust cell layouts that have no hotspot under the several PPE conditions are created.", "With the upcoming technology generations, it will become increasingly challenging to provide a good yield and/or yield ramp. In addition, we observe yield detractors migrating from defects via systematic effects such as litho and CMP to out-of-spec scenarios, i.e. a slow, but continuous migration into an typical environment for analog devices. Preparing for such scenarios, worldwide activities are ongoing to extract the device parameters not from the drawn layout, but from the resist image or, at best, from etched contours. The litho-aware approach allows to detect devices of high variability and to reduce the variations on the critical paths based on this analysis. We report in this paper the analysis of MOSFET parameters from printed PC contours of standard cell libraries based on litho simulation (LfD). It will be shown how to extract gate lengths and -widths from print images, how to backannotate the gate parameters into a litho-aware spice netlist and to finally analyse the effect of across chip line width variations (ACLV) and process window influence based on litho-aware spice netlist.", "During the Design-to-Manufacturing tape out flow, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is commonly adopted to correct the systematic proximity-effects-caused patterning distortions in order to minimize the across-gate and across-chip linewidth variation. With the continued scaling of gate length, the OPC correction scheme inevitably becomes more aggressive nowadays; increasing the mask complexity and cost proportionally. This could partly be attributed to the purely geometry-based OPC algorithm which tries to match every edge in the layout, without considering its actual impact on circuit performance. Therefore, possibility exists for over-corrected OPC mask that bring slight improvement in circuit performance at the expense of disproportionate higher cost. To simplify the mask design, we present a device performance-based OPC (DPB-OPC) algorithm to generate the mask based on the performance matching criteria rather than the geometrical pattern matching criteria. Drive current (Ion) and leakage current (Ioff) of transistor are chosen to be the performance indexes in this DPB-OPC flow. When compared to the conventional OPC approaches, our proposed approach results in simpler mask that achieves closer circuit performance.", "Design rules for logic device have been defined by technology requirement like shrink rate of chip area or process capability of lithography and other processes. However, those rules are usually only for minimum pitches or minimum sizes of simple layout, such as line and space patterns with enough long common run length, no intermediate corners, no jogs and no asymmetry patterns. On the other hand, actual chip layout includes many variations of pattern which often cause trouble in wafer manufacturing process due to their less process capability, would be found far later when the design rules are fixed. To solve this issue, additional design rules for two-dimensional patterns, such as line-end to lineend space, are necessary and have been applied into recent design rules. It is hard to check such many variations of pattern by the experiment with actual wafer, so checking by lithography simulation in advance is very effective way to estimate and fix design rules for these two dimensional patterns. To estimate rules with accuracy, and to minimize numbers in each rule for chip area reduction, OPC and RET must be included in the estimation, particularly for recent low-k1 lithography. However, OPC and RET are also immature in the early development term, when design rules are necessary for designers to prepare a test mask to develop the device, process and some parts of circuit. In other words, OPC, RET and design rules have been modified in parallel, sometime new RET would be required to achieve a rule, sometime the design rules would be required to relax their numbers, and sometime new design rules would be required to avoid less process capability. In this paper, we propose the parallel development procedure for OPC, RET and design rules through the actual development of 45nm node logic device, focused on metal layer which has many pattern variations, and show how to build the competitive design rules by applying the latest OPC and RET technologies.", "Design For Manufacturing (DFM) has been paid attention as the feature size on chip goes down below the k1 factor of 0.25. Lots of DFM related ideas have been come up, tried, and some of them adopted for wider process window and as a result, higher yield. As the minimum features are getting shrunk, the design rules become more complicated, but still not good enough to describe the complexity and limitation of certain patterns that imposes narrow process window, or even failure of device. Thus, it becomes essential to identify, correct, or remove the litho-unfriendly patterns (more widely called as hot spots), before OPC. One of the efforts is to write a DFM rules in addition to conventional DRC rules. In this study, we use the software, called YAM (Yield Analysis Module) to detect hot spots on pre-OPC layouts. Conventional DRC-based search is not able to surpass YAM, as it enables to identify hot spots in either much easier way or even ones that are unable to be found by DRC. We have developed a sophisticated methodology to detect and fix OPC- and/or litho-unfriendly patterns. It is confirmed to enlarge process window and the degree of freedom on OPC work.", "As the semiconductor feature size continues to shrink, electrical resistance issue is becoming one of the industry's dreaded problems. In order to overcome such problem, many of the top semiconductor manufacturers have turned there interest to copper process. Widely known, copper process is the trench first damascene process which utilize dark tone mask instead of widely used clear tone mask. Due to unfamiliarity and under development of dark tone mask technology compared to clear tone mask, many have reported patterning defect issues using dark tone mask. Therefore, necessity of DFM[1] for design that meets both dark and clear tone is very large in development of copper process based device. In this study, we will propose a process friendly Design For Manufacturing (DFM) rule for dual tone mask. Proposed method guides the layout rule to give same performance from both dark tone and clear tone mask from same design layout. Our proposed method will be analyzed on photolithography process margin factors such as Depth Of Focus (DOF) and Exposure Latitude (EL) on sub 50nm Flash memory interconnection layer.", "As the device's design rule has been scaled down, the needs of robust and accurate OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) model have been increased. In order to meet the needs, we adopt the method of increasing the image parameter space coverage, such as using SEM-contour based OPC model which provides hundreds or thousands of measurement data set from each SEM image. It differs from traditional model calibration measurement data set from 1D or 2D symmetric test pattern which is just one CD measurement data from one pattern. In SEM contour-based model OPC, it is important that what kinds of patterns are chosen for model calibration and how the SEM image contours are extracted to improve model accuracy. In this paper, we selected the SEM images for SEM contour modeling analyzing aerial image intensity variation. As finding optically sensitive patterns, we could make robust and accurate OPC model across the process window. In this SEM-contour based OPC modeling, we applied the method from commercial SEM company.", "We constructed hot spot management flow with a die-to-database inspection system that is required for both hot spot extraction accuracy and short development turn-around-time (TAT) in low k1 lithography. The die-to-database inspection system, NGR-2100, has remarkable features for the full chip inspection within reasonable operating time. The system provided higher hot spot extraction accuracy than the conventional optical inspection tool. Also, hot spots extracted by the system could cover all killer hot spots extracted by electrical and physical analysis. In addition, the new hot spot extraction methodology employing the die-to-database inspection system is highly advantageous in that it shortens development TAT by two to four months. In the application to 65nm node CMOS, we verified yield improvement with the new hot spot management flow. Also, the die-to-database inspection system demonstrated excellent interlayer hot spot extraction from the viewpoint of LSI fabrication.", "Lithography simulation has proven to be a technical enabler to shorten development cycle time and provide direction before next-generation exposure tools and processes are available. At the early stages of design rule definition for a new technology node, small critical areas of layout are of concern, and optical proximity correction (OPC) is required to allow full exploration of the 2D rule space. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of fast, resist-model-based, OPC correction to explore process options and optimize 2D layout rules for advanced technologies. Unlike conventional OPC models that rely on extensive empirical CD-SEM measurements of real wafers, the resist-based OPC model for the correction is generated using measured bulk parameters of the photoresist such as dissolution rate. The model therefore provides extremely accurate analysis capability well in advance of access to advanced exposure tools. We apply this 'virtual patterning' approach to refine lithography tool settings and OPC strategies for a collection of 32-nm-node layout clips. Different OPC decorations including line biasing, serifs, and assist features, are investigated as a function of NA and illumination conditions using script-based optimization sequences. Best process conditions are identified based on optimal process window for a given set of random layouts. Simulation results, including resist profile and CD process window, are validated by comparison to wafer images generated on an older-generation exposure tool. The ability to quickly optimize OPC as a function of illumination setting in a single simulation package allows determination of optimum illumination source for random layouts faster and more accurately than what has been achievable in the past. This approach greatly accelerates design rule determination.", "A new Robust Process Window Qualification (PWQ) Technique to perform systematic defect characterization to enlarge the Lithographic process window is described, using a Die-to-Database Verification Tool (NGR2100).", "As the semiconductor industry moves to the 45nm node and beyond, the tolerable lithography process window significantly shrinks due to the combined use of high NA and low k1 factor. This is exacerbated by the fact that the usable depth of focus at 45nm node for critical layer is 200nm or less. Traditional Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) only computes the optimal pattern layout to optimize its patterning at nominal process condition (nominal defocus and nominal exposure dose) according to an OPC model calibrated at this nominal condition, and this may put the post-OPC layout at nonnegligible patterning risk due to the inevitable process variation (defocus and dose variations). With a little sacrifice at the nominal condition, process variation aware OPC can greatly enhance the robustness of post-OPC layout patterning in the presence of defocus and dose variation. There is also an increasing demand for through process window lithography verification for post-OPC circuit layout. The corner stone for successful process variation aware OPC and lithography verification is an accurately calibrated continuous process window model which is a continuous function of defocus and dose. This calibrated model needs to be able to interpolate and extrapolate in the usable process window. Based on Synopsys' OPC modeling software package ProGen, we developed and implemented a novel methodology for continuous process window (PW) model, which has two continuous adjustable process parameters: defocus and dose. The calibration of this continuous PW model was performed in a single calibration process using silicon measurement at nominal condition and off-focus-off-dose conditions which are sparsely sampled within the measured entire focus exposure matrix (FEM). The silicon data at the off-focus-off-dose conditions not used for model calibration was utilized to validate the accuracy and stability of PW model during model interpolation and extrapolation. We demonstrated this novel continuous PW modeling approach can achieve very good performance both at nominal condition and at interpolated or extrapolated off-focus-off-dose conditions.", "Timely process characterization is crucial in Design for Manufacturing. Scatterometry as a powerful metrology tool can be extended for optical system characterization. In this paper, we show how scatterometry can be used in conjunction with an array of dual-pitch or dual-bar gratings to measure optical aberrations. Multiple pattern designs are presented and compared. A linear model is used to describe the relation between aberration and measurable quantities. Firstprinciple simulation results shows the current approach can simultaneously measure various Zernike coefficients with accuracy ~2 m\u03bb.", "As a preliminary step towards Model-Based Process Window OPC we have analyzed the impact of correcting post-OPC layouts using rules based methods. Image processing on the Brion Tachyon was used to identify sites where the OPC model/recipe failed to generate an acceptable solution. A set of rules for 65nm active and poly were generated by classifying these failure sites. The rules were based upon segment runlengths, figure spaces, and adjacent figure widths. 2.1 million sites for active were corrected in a small chip (comparing the pre and post rules based operations), and 59 million were found at poly. Tachyon analysis of the final reticle layout found weak margin sites distinct from those sites repaired by rules-based corrections. For the active layer more than 75% of the sites corrected by rules would have printed without a defect indicating that most rulesbased cleanups degrade the lithographic pattern. Some sites were missed by the rules based cleanups due to either bugs in the DRC software or gaps in the rules table. In the end dramatic changes to the reticle prevented catastrophic lithography errors, but this method is far too blunt. A more subtle model-based procedure is needed changing only those sites which have unsatisfactory lithographic margin.", "Over the past several years, choosing the best Resolution Enhancement Technique (RET) has become more and more difficult. The RET implementation team is faced with an ever increasing number of variables to attempt to optimize. Also, for a given node, there are now more layers designated as critical pattern layers requiring RET. As design rules become more aggressive, and scanners have more process parameters such as polarization and focus drilling, RET must be optimized across a larger number of variables than before. Sorting through the best combination of all of the available process parameters could potentially require the number of wafer experiments to increase exponentially. Rigorous, physics-based computational lithography is the perfect tool for executing the large number of experiments, virtually, culling out dramatically the actual number of physical wafer experiments required for verification. Ideally, first pass RET selection needs to be made as early as possible in the technology cycle, well before the equipment is available. Traditional OPC tools, which require wafer process data to set up are not suited to this task, as they can only be used after the equipment has been installed and a stable, established process exists. Rigorous physical and chemical models, such as those found in PROLITH, are better suited to early RET selection and optimization but the Windows platform, where PROLITH is used, is computationally too slow for the massive number of calculations required. In this study, we focus on the RET selection process for a set of \"typical\" critical test patterns, using KLATencor's other rigorous, physics-based computational lithography tool, LithoWare. LithoWare combines the accuracy of rigorous physical and chemical models with the computational power of distributed computing on Linux. We examine the use of cluster computing in optimizing the illuminators using model based OPC and process window analysis for critical contact hole (CH) patterns. We use the results to propose a comprehensive RET selection strategy to meet the user requirements of 45nm and 32 nm development.", "The 22nm logic technology node with dimensions of ~32nm will be the first node to require some form of pitch-halving. A unique combination of a Producer APF(R)-based process sequence and GDR-based design style permits implementation of random logic functions with regular layout patterns. The APF (Advanced Patterning Film) pitch-halving approach is a classic Self-Aligned Double Patterning scheme (SADP) [1,2,3,4] which involves the creation of CVD dielectric spacers on an APF sacrificial template and using the spacers as a hardmask for line frequency doubling. The Tela CanvaTM implements Gridded Design Rules (GDR) using straight lines placed on a regular grid. Logic functions can be implemented using lines on a half-pitch with gaps at selected locations.", "As design rules shrink, the goal for model-based OPC/RET schemes is to minimize the discrepancy between the intended pattern and the printed pattern, particularly among 2d structures. Errors in the OPC design often result from insufficient model calibration across the parameter space of the imaging system and the focus-exposure process window. Full-chip simulations can enable early detection of hotspots caused by OPC/RET errors, but often these OPC model simulations have calibration limitations that result in undetected critical hotspots which limit the process window and yield. Also, as manufacturing processes are improved to drive yield enhancement, and are transferred to new facilities, the lithography tools and processes may differ from the original process used for OPC/RET model calibration conditions, potentially creating new types of hotspots in the patterned layer. In this work, we examine the predictive performance of rigorous physics-based 193 nm resist models in terms of portability and extrapolative accuracy. To test portability, the performance of a physical model calibrated using 1d data from a development facility will be quantified using 1d and 2d hotspot data generated at a different manufacturing facility with a production attenuated-PSM lithography process at k1 < 0.4. To test extrapolative accuracy, a similar test will be conducted using data generated at the manufacturing facility with illumination conditions which differ significantly from the original calibration conditions. Simulations of post-OPC process windows will be used to demonstrate application of calibrated physics-based resist models in hotspot characterization and mitigation.", "As technologies scale, the impact of process variations to circuit performance and power consumption is increasingly significant. In order to improve the efficiency of statistical circuit optimization, a better understanding of the relationship between circuit variability and process variation is needed. Our work proposes a hierarchical variability model, which addresses both systematic and random variations at wafer, field, die, and device level, and spatial correlation artifacts are captured implicitly. Finally, layout dependent effects are incorporated as an additive component. The model is verified by applying to 90nm ring oscillator measurement data and can be used for variability prediction and optimization.", "At low k1 lithography and strong off-axis illumination, it is very hard to achieve edge-placement tolerances and 2-D image fidelity requirements for some layout configurations. Quite often these layouts are within simple design rules constraint for a given technology node. Evidently it is important to have these layouts included during early RET flow development. Simple shrinkage from previous technology node is quite common, although often not enough. For logic designs, it is hard to control design styles. Moreover for engineers in fabless design groups, it is difficult to assess the manufacturability of their layouts because of the lack of understanding of the litho process. Assist features (AF) are frequently placed according to pre-determined rules to improve lithography process window. These rules are usually derived from lithographic models. Direct validation of AF rules is required at development phase.To ensure good printability through process window, process aware optical proximity correction (OPC) recipes were developed. Generally rules based correction is performed before model based correction. Furthermore, there are also lots of other options and parameters in OPC recipes for an advanced technology, thus making it difficult to holistically optimize performance of recipe bearing all these variables in mind. In this paper we demonstrate the application of layout DOE in RET flow development. Layout pattern libraries are generated using the Synopsys Test Pattern Generator (STPG), which is embedded in a layout tool (ICWB). Assessment gauges are generated together with patterns for quick correction accuracy assessment. OPC verification through full process is also deployed. Several groups of test pattern libraries for different applications are developed, ranging from simple 1D pattern for process capability study and settings of process aware parameters to a full set of patterns for the assessment of rules based correction, line end and corner interaction, active and poly interaction, and critical patterns for contact coverage, etc. Restrictive design rules (RDR) are commonly deployed to eliminate problematic layouts. We demonstrate RDR evaluation and validation using our layout design of experiments (DOE) approach. This technique of layout DOE also offers a simple and yet effective way to verify AF placement rules. For a given nominal layout features all possible assist features are generated within the mask rules constraint using STPG. Then we run OPC correction and assess main feature critical dimension (CD) at best and worst process condition in ICWB. Best assist feature placement rules are derived based on minimum CD difference. The rules derived from this approach are not the same as those derived from the commonly used method of least intensity variation.", "The impact of gate line edge roughness (LER) on the performance variability of 32nm double-gate (DG) FinFETs is investigated using a framework that links device performance to commonly used LER descriptors, namely correlation length (\u03be), RMS amplitude or standard deviation (\u03c3) of the line edge from its mean value, and roughness exponent (\u03b1). This modeling approach is more efficient than Monte-Carlo TCAD simulations, and provides comparable results with appropriately selected input parameters. The FinFET device architecture is found to be robust to gate LER effects. Additionally, a spacer-defined gate electrode provides for dramatically reduced variability in device performance compared to a resist-defined gate electrode, which indicates that gate-length mismatch contributes more to variability in performance than lateral offset between the front and the back gate.", "As photomask critical dimensions shrink significantly below the exposure wavelength and the angle of off-axis illumination increases, the use of Kirchhoff thin mask approximation cannot capture diffraction and polarization effects that occur at a topographical mask surface. Such approximation errors result in inaccurate models that lead to poor prediction for image simulation, which can waste time and money during lithographic process development cycle. The real effects of a thick mask can be simulated using finite difference time domain (FDTD) electromagnetic (EM) field calculations, or be better approximated with less error using such techniques such as boundary layer or various Fourier transformation techniques.", "Litho-aware design methodology is the key to enable the aggressive scaling down to the future technology node. Boundary based methodology for cellwise OPC has been proposed to account for influence from features of neighboring cells. As technology advances toward 32 and 22 nm, more columns of features are needed as representative environments for the boundary-based cellwise OPC. In this paper, we propose a new method that combines the fill insertion and boundary-based cellwise OPC to reduce the mask data size as well as the prohibitive runtime of full-chip OPC, making cell characterization more predictable. To make the number of cell OPC solutions easy to handle, we present a new methodology which uses dummy fill insertion both inside and outside cells to solve the issue for technologies beyond 45 nm. Experimental results show a solid 30% improvement on average and maximum edge placement errors (EPE) over the previous work.", "Aerial image simulation of interdigitated sidewall capacitor layouts and extraction of feature changes are used to estimate the parametric performance spread of DC Metal-Oxide-Metal (MOM) mixed signal capacitors as a function of the normalized lithographic resolution k1. Since minimum feature sizes are utilized, the variation of MOM capacitors is attributed to lithography spacing. In this paper, k1 of 0.8, 0.56, 0.40, and 0.28 are studied. The DC capacitance shows a worst-case variability of 42%. While line-end-shortening is a small fractional change in finger length and proves to be not a critical factor in variability, spacing width proves to be the main source of the variability in DC capacitance. Different annular illumination settings are explored for mitigating the variability in spacing width. Co-design of the pitch and illumination shows that for each k1, there is an optimal annular illumination radius. The optimal set of sigmas (i.e. sigma_in and sigma_out) can control the variability between linewidths and spacing widths to 20%.", "Double patterning technology (DPT) is one of the most practical candidate technologies for 45nm half-pitch or beyond while conventional single exposure (SE) is still dominant with hyper NA avoiding DPT difficulties such as split-conflict or overlay issue. However small target dimension with hyper NA and strong illumination causes OPC difficulty and small latitude of lithography and photomask fabricated with much tight specification are required for SE. Then there must be double patterning (DP) approach even for SE available resolution. In this paper DP for SE available resolution is evaluated on lithography performance, pattern decomposition, photomask fabrication and inspection load. DP includes pattern pitch doubled of SE, then lithography condition such as mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) is less impacted and the lower MEEF means less tight specification for photomask fabrication. By using Synopsys DPT software, there are no software-induced conflicts and stitching is treated to be less impact. And also this software detects split-conflicts such as triangle or square placement from contact spacing. For estimating photomask inspection load, programmed defect pattern and circuit pattern on binary mask are prepared. Smaller MEEF leads less impact to defect printing which is confirmed with AIMS evaluation. As an inspection result, there are few differences of defect sensitivity for only dense features and also few differences of false defect counts between SE and DP with less NA. But if higher NA used, DP's inspection sensitivity is able to be lowered Then inspection load for DP would be lighter than SE.", "During early stage of a memory device development, photolithography engineer provide a lithography friendly layout to a designer and assist in development of design rule. Most of the cases, lithographer relies on the accuracy of lithography simulator to generate some guidelines and/or modifications to a designer which may be sufficient for a cell only design. Even for such a cell only designs, it is increasingly difficult to perform such task due to shrinkage of chip design. For some random pattern design contained in a core and periphery regions, a more rapid method of evaluating the layout is needed. In order to perform a fast evaluation, a calibrated proximity model is needed. If a calibration data is available, a layout can be OPCed and verified to detect weak spots. On the other hand, a calibration data may not be available during early design stage. In this paper, a method of obtaining lithography model without the need of calibration data is presented. First, an illumination source optimization is performed on the specific patterns to minimize the effect of critical dimension variation. Using the illumination condition obtained, an optical model is used to determine the first level layout weak spots which are most critical to a specific layer type based on the image quality analysis. At this point, one may choose to perform OPC using the optical model and analyze the process margin. A further interest is on whether if a particular model can by-pass the need for OPC layout in verifying the layout.", "Delays in equipment availability for both Extreme UV and High index immersion have led to a growing interest in double patterning as a suitable solution for the 22nm logic node. Double patterning involves decomposing a layout into two masking layers that are printed and etched separately so as to provide the intrinsic manufacturability of a previous lithography node with the pitch reduction of a more aggressive node. Most 2D designs cannot be blindly shrunk to run automatically on a double patterning process and so a set of guidelines for how to layout for this type of flow is needed by designers. While certain classes of layout can be clearly identified and avoided based on short range interactions, compliance issues can also extend over large areas of the design and are hard to recognize. This means certain design practices should be implemented to provide suitable breaks or performed with layout tools that are double patterning compliance aware. The most striking set of compliance errors result in layout on one of the masks that is at the minimum design space rather than the relaxed space intended. Another equally important class of compliance errors is that related to marginal printability, be it poor wafer overlap and/or poor process window (depth of focus, dose latitude, MEEF, overlay). When decomposing a layout the tool is often presented with multiple options for where to cut the design thereby defining an area of overlap between the different printed layers. While these overlap areas can have markedly different topologies (for instance the overlap may occur on a straight edge or at a right angled corner), quantifying the quality of a given overlap ensures that more robust decomposition solutions can be chosen over less robust solutions. Layouts which cannot be decomposed or which can only be decomposed with poor manufacturability need to be highlighted to the designer, ideally with indications on how best to resolve this issue. This paper uses an internally developed automated double pattern decomposition tool to investigate design compliance and describes a number of classes of non-conforming layout. Tool results then provide help to the designer to achieve robust design compliant layout.", "Design rules and the design rule check (DRC) utility are conventional approaches to design for manufacturability (DFM). The DRC utility is based on unsophisticated rules to check the design layout in a simple environment. As the design dimension shrinks drastically, the introduction of a more powerful DFM utility with model-based layout patterning check (LPC) becomes mandatory for designers to filter process weak-points before taping out layouts. In this paper, a system of integrated hotspot scores consisting of three lithography sensitive indexes is proposed to assist designers to circumvent risky layout patterns in lithography. With the hotspot fixing guideline and the hotspot severity classification deduced from the scoring system provided in this paper, designers can deliver much more manufacturable designs.", "It is well known that as design rule shrink advanced techniques are required in-order to precisely and controllably print the design intent on a wafer. The commonly used techniques to overcome the resolution limit are OPC and RET. The goal of these techniques is to compensate for an expected local interaction between the light, mask pattern and photoresist, which will otherwise result in a mismatch between the printed pattern and design intent and lead to fatal yield failures. It is this interaction which dominates the extensive time-consuming mask qualification fabs are required to perform before a new mask on a new product can be inserted into a production line. In this paper, a new approach and Litho Qualification Monitor (LQM) system, implemented in Qimonda Dresden fab, for ultra fast pattern failure classification based on design information (Design Based Binning), coupled with an automatic interface to SEM metrology tool will be presented. The system centralizes all the operations required for the identification and analysis of marginally-printed systematic structures.", "An automatic system that combines actions in both the image domain as well as in the layout-database domain for accurate mask-defect analysis and application of design criticality will be presented. In this paper we will emphasize the qualification and calibration of the system and its various pieces of functionality with the use of programmed defect masks and low-voltage mask CD-SEM measurement data. Results on 1D and 2D programmed defects of various natures are reported in dense layout as well as in real memory design layout. The results show that the system can accurately extract mask CD-errors and defect sizes at a resolution far below that of the pixel-size of state-of-the-art mask-defect inspection tools at nanometer resolution. We will further demonstrate that mask-defect-inspection data can contain optical anomalies when defect or residual feature sizes are smaller than the inspection wavelength. Mask inspection images then no longer show the real defect. These anomalies can be analyzed with the system using advanced image actions. Finally, we will demonstrate the capability to calculate the effects that defects have on final wafer printability even without the need for input layout. Hence, model-based defect properties can be combined with rule-based defect properties as well as multi-layer, design-based criticality-region properties for utter flexibility in defect disposition capability.", "Existing optical proximity correction tools aim at minimizing edge placement errors (EPE) due to the optical and resist process by moving mask edges. However, in low-k1 lithography, especially at 45nm and beyond, printing perfect polygons is practically impossible to achieve in addition to incurring prohibitively high mask complexity and cost. Given the impossibility of perfect printing, we argue that aiming to reduce the error of electrical discrepancy between the ideal and the printed contours is a more reasonable strategy. In fact, we show that contours with non-minimal EPE may result in closer match to the desired electrical performance. Towards achieving this objective, we developed a new electrically driven OPC (ED-OPC) algorithm. The tool combines lithography simulation with an accurate contour-based model of shape electrical behavior to predict the on/off current through a transistor gate. The algorithm then guides edge movements to minimize the error in current, rather than in edge placement, between current values for printed and target shapes. The results on industrial 45nm SOI layouts using high-NA immersion lithography models show up to a 5% improvement in accuracy of timing over conventional OPC, while at the same time showing up to 50% reduction in mask complexity for gate regions. The results confirm that better timing accuracy can be achieved despite larger edge placement error."], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
