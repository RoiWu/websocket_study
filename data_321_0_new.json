In 2019 the first commercially available smartphones, which included IC\u2019s made with EUV, demonstrated that EUV had entered high volume manufacturing. In the presentation a brief review will be given how many technology obstacles in the scanner and the scanner infrastructure have been overcome. Next an overview of current status of 0.33 numerical aperture scanner and the infrastructure will be shared as well as the impact it has on the semiconductor industry. A next step in the EUV technology will be the realization of an 0.55 numerical aperture EUV scanner, a project well under way. After introduction of the first NA=0.55 scanner further innovations in scanner, mask and resist are foreseen, they will further reduce the \u201ck1\u201d factor and enable a continuation of shrinkage well into the next decade. A shift to smaller wavelength and/or larger numerical aperture are both being explored. They will come with significant technical and business challenges. Some of the key technical challenges presented as a challenge towards to litho community.", "In the concept phase of EUV lithography much thought was spent on engineering the best multilayer mirror to achieve the optimal combination of wavelength and reflectivity. The EUV mask started its career in lithography as a commodity, benefitting from the mirror technology with an opaque layer carrying the pattern, for which Tantalum was a straightforward choice. The low NA of 0.25 and the technology nodes for 90nm pitch at the start of the EUV era, allowed the mask industry to drive the fabrication of the Ta-based EUV mask to perfection. As the understanding of the EUVL grew, its different components \u2013 e.g., resist, scanner optics, source - are being tailored to create the perfect aerial image and robust resist pattern. Since recent years, the attention is moving more and more to the EUV mask. Mask specific challenges involve mask deficiency induced stochastic failures, the anamorphicity of high-NA EUVL and mask 3D effects. Pellicle development and mask lifetime understanding are well progressing to control mask deficiency impact on wafer, and mask data prep software is being made aware to handle different mask reduction factors. Mask 3D effects, as a common denominator for inherent pitch- and orientation-dependent wafer observations, are identified to limit wafer performance for current and future technology nodes of 32nm pitch and below. Initial solutions are proposed by source-mask optimization, where the illumination and mask design are compensating these wafer effects, which are in fact due to the choice of the mask materials. At imec we started several years ago to target the mask material as the parameter to control the mask 3D effects on wafer. Our strategy towards a material down-selection for a mask technology change evolves on two levels, demonstrating improvements from lithographic perspective and validating compatibility with essential mask absorber requirements. Through simulations we mapped EUV n&k regions with their expected imaging benefit. Our simulation approach and material properties knowledge directed our engineering and characterization of novel absorber films. Various patterning strategies are investigated to ultimately validate the experimental imaging behavior to the simulation predictions. In this effort imec actively drives collaboration with suppliers, stakeholders, and institutes to explore the EUV mask space. The choice of EUV SPIE committee to have EUV mask as a keynote topic this year emphasizes that this mask material change is no longer a research matter, but a key enabler to fully exploit EUVL now and in the future.", "While EUV systems equipped with a 0.33 Numerical Aperture (NA) lens are being applied in high volume manufacturing, ASML and ZEISS are in parallel ramping up their activities on an EUV exposure tool with an NA of 0.55. The purpose of this so-called high-NA scanner, targeting an ultimate resolution of 8nm, is to extend Moore\u2019s law for another decade. A novel lens design, capable of providing the required Numerical Aperture, has been identified; this lens will be paired with new, faster stages and more accurate sensors enabling the tight focus and overlay control needed for future nodes. In this paper we will outline the advantages of High-NA, especially for managing the needed extreme low defect printing rates while maximizing the effective throughput for patterning economics. The imaging performance is being simulated based on expected surface figures of the illumination and projection optics. Next to this, an update will be given on the status of the developments at ZEISS and ASML. Buildings, cleanrooms and equipment are being constructed, mirror production is ramping up, many tests are carried out to ensure a smooth implementation.", "We have used the MET5 exposure system using \u201cdark field\u201d lithography, where a small \u03c3=0.1 source is wholly contained in the 30% Central Obscuration of the 0.5NA mirror optics. One goal of this paper is to quantify and explain the superior image contrast of dark field lithography over normal dipole imagery. We demonstrate that almost ideal grating images can be obtained over the pitch range from 15 to 25nm. With the x-polarized source, gratings with Horizontal lines (TE polarized) have the best image contrast, while Vertical lines (TM polarized) have lesser contrast, showing less contrast as pitch decreases. By comparing lines of different orientation, the impact of polarization on lithography can be assessed. At the 16nm pitch, the experimental data showed roughly 20% improvement of the LWR metric for TE over TM. Besides the image contrast, we also calculate the effective contrast Ceff by folding in a Gaussian resist blur. These calculations highlight the need to find resist processes with small blur, e.g. with \u03c3 < 3nm. Exposure latitude scales with Ceff, as does LWR, LCDU and stochastic defect levels. Therefore optimization of Ceff, at the small pitches needed for production, is of high importance. We have also looked at dense arrays of bright spots produced with dark field imaging, which can produce either dense contact holes or dense pillars depending on the resist process tone. Our experimental results used a negative tone Metal Oxide resist process to print pillar arrays with pitches of 22, 24 and 26nm. Our experiments, and most of our simulations, were done with a standard EUV mask using a Ta-based absorber. Additional simulations explored the use of alternative absorber materials which can increase the dark field image intensity. For example, 25nm thick Ru absorber can more than double the image intensity relative to Ta absorber. The MET5 dark field litho imaging method is well-suited for testing resist processes in advance of the high NA tool availability. Both dense line gratings and dense hole/pillar array images can be imaged with good image contrast. However, pure dark field imaging is not capable of producing all the patterns needed for production, such as the larger pitch structures needed for overlay and alignment marks. On the other hand, there is a kind of \u201cpartial\u201d dark field imagery that is very promising for production imaging with the high NA tool. Allowing Source Mask Optimization (SMO) software to include source points within the obscured part of the pupil, i.e. \u201cdark field source points\u201d, implements this capability in a very natural way and seems attractive for High Volume Manufacturing (HMV) applications with the high NA tool in the near future.", "High NA EUV lithography will offer single exposure patterning for pitches below 28nm, simplifying process flows. However, overlay error complexity will increase. Specifically, a semiconductor build will require use of both high NA EUV tools that can only expose half the field size of low NA EUV and optical tools. This means that to achieve full productivity on the low NA EUV and optical tools used, a semiconductor build using these tools will need to minimize overlay error back to a scanner map exposed with the high NA EUV tool that has twice the number of exposures. Overlay error minimization on full field tools takes advantage of keeping exposure maps constant between different layers so that scan direction and step direction are maintained. This is not possible when using a high NA EUV tool in a semiconductor build unless the number of scans on the low NA and optical tools are doubled, thus decreasing the productivity on those tools. Having a full field minimize overlay error back to two half fields results in new required overlay controls between the two half fields to achieve low overlay error. In particular, stitch overlay control for the half field exposures can be very helpful to achieving good overlay error between a layer exposed with full field exposure map and a layer exposed with a half field exposure map. To get early learning on these effects, we designed a test reticle with a unique \u201cfigure 8\u201d black border that allows step plans to be exposed with either half or full field exposures. To get rapid learning the reticle is designed to take advantage of resist-to-resist overlay targets that engage with each other when there is a programed 180 um step delta between the two exposures. The effects of order of exposures as well as scan and step direction differences between the half field and full field step plans are investigated.", "0.33 NA EUV scanners are being used for High Volume Manufacturing. In this paper we will give an update on the performance improvements of the NXE:3400 systems related to the lithographic performance, productivity and uptime. Finally we look at future system improvements to meet requirements for the 3 nm node and beyond.", "With the introduction of the NXE:3400 scanner, ASML has brought EUV lithography to high-volume manufacturing (HVM) at the 7-nm logic node and beyond. In this presentation, we will briefly summarize the imaging performance results obtained from the latest NXE:3400 system that is characterized by a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.33 and a pupil-fill ratio (PFR) of 0.2. Then we will discuss enhancement techniques which can be considered to push EUV lithography to finer resolution and lower k1 values. We will do this by first looking back over the last two decades at the enhancement techniques considered and used for low k1 imaging in KrF, ArF and ArFi lithographies and discussing their applicability for EUV lithography. We also will look into the fundamental differences between KrF/ArF and EUV, most notably concerning resist and mask. Both have an impact on the effective NILS. Two main pillars for both DUV and EUV NILS or imaging enhancement are the mask absorber embodiment and the illumination pupil characteristics. We will summarize our findings on mask optimization, which has been carried out by studying EUV lithography at diffraction level. We will show by simulations and experiments how M3D effects (contrast loss, best focus per feature) can be mitigated by either advanced mask embodiments or advanced illumination schemes.", "Simulations on attenuated phase-shift masks (att PSM) for EUV have shown that these novel mask absorbers can strongly boost optical contrast. The optimum EUV imaging mask does not only need to balance the diffraction order amplitudes (as in DUV imaging), it also needs to mitigate the strong mask 3D effects that are present in EUV lithography. The latter is very important and strongly relies on material properties. Here, we present an overall progress update on our att PSM work, including the first experimental lithography results on an EUV att PSM test mask and guidelines needed for optimum performance from diffraction point of view.", "Achieving the ultimate resolution limit of EUV lithography is greatly impeded by the 3D photomask geometry, including an absorber whose thickness is comparable to the minimum lateral dimensions of the pattern, and a reflection plane a similar depth beneath the surface of the multilayer mirror. Rigorous simulations have shown that these effects can in theory be mitigated by adopting a thinner absorber and a multilayer with a reflection plane closer to the surface. But regardless of how rigorously the design is optimized, there is clearly a need to experimentally confirm that the as-built photomask conforms to the simulation\u2019s predicted complex electric field. This experimental confirmation is difficult because only the field\u2019s intensity is directly observable. One promising approach to unambiguously make this measurement is Zernike phase contrast imaging, which determines the complex electric field from intensity images acquired from a single illumination condition with different phase shifts on the 0 order. In this work we present an extension to a hyperspectral version of the technique. By varying the wavelength, we are able to empirically observe the complicated interaction between absorber, multilayer, pattern, and illumination. We performed an experimental demonstration of the technique on a patterned EUV mask with 60nm TaN absorber using specially fabricated zone plates on the SHARP EUV microscope at the Center for X-Ray Optics. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of hZPC to both the Fresnel reflectance as well as more subtle 3D effects also observed in rigorous simulations.", "In this submission we describe a framework to simulate mask variability in the form of CD distributions, edge placement error distributions and edge roughness. The impact of each method on wafer variability is then simulated. The results show that assumptions of mask edge placement correlation affect the match of simulated wafer variability to experiment, and that simulated mask contributions to wafer variability are not negligible. The authors demonstrate that for a DRAM use case, wafer level variability increases with scaling, but can be reduced with mask and wafer process improvement. For a curvilinear use case it is demonstrated that the contribution of mask roughness to wafer level variation can be large compared to typical process specs.", "An optical design of EUV attenuated PSM is proposed for contact-hole imaging. LCDU depends on MEEF as well as NILS. If co-optimization of MEEF and NILS is carried out, EUV PSM performs better when the PSM reflectance is higher. In order to make a high-reflectance PSM, the shifter materials should be as transparent as possible. Since the shifter\u2019s thickness variation throughout the mask can cause phase and reflectance variation and thus global CD variation, its thickness should be set where phase and reflectance are least sensitive to such thickness variation. In short, the shifter\u2019s thickness should be determined to maximize PSM performance while ensuring lithography process robustness. Applying PSM so designed leads to a dramatically lower dose-to-size while maintaining LCDU at the same level. Proposed PSM is manufacturable and effective in increasing throughput of EUV lithography.", "We propose and prove an alternative view of patterns on the EUV mask absorber as waveguides. The geometrical similarities between waveguides and EUV mask after stripping out the multilayer is shown. The waveguiding effect inside the EUV mask absorber is demonstrated by comparing rigorous RCWA (rigorous coupled-wave analysis) to the waveguide analytical solution. Our investigations of the near field of EUV mask demonstrate that waveguide effects dominate transmission of light through openings in the absorber of EUV masks. This perspective of the EUV mask is not to provide a model that explains all phenomena in EUV imaging scenarios or to propose other absorber materials. Instead, the proposed waveguide perspective of EUV masks helps to understand the root causes of certain far field and imaging characteristics of EUV masks.", "Next generation high volume EUV manufacturing for 7, 5 and 3 nm nodes drives advanced performance in material design, specification and selection. Materials are currently adapted for ever increasingly complex lithographic design with tight tolerances; some trade-offs leading to sub-optimal performance. We consider a new class of materials for the EUV photomask and optics that have the potential for advanced lithographic performance. The overarching factors that drive adoption include performance, lifetime, manufacturability, cost of operations and cost of consumables. As such any new selection in materials must demonstrate robustness against these specifications. Astrileux is sponsored by National Science Foundation and CASIS.", "The development of EUV lithography has been enabled by the resist material design which had initially adapted of known concepts from DUV lithography. But with the low number of photon counts in EUV has brought stochastics defects as a significant concern to enable yield. This paper will review the development on resist concepts that have targeted limiting variations in resist design to mitigate stochastic defects. The limits of this trade-off between improving stochastics-related defects with a higher dose will also be discussed. How strongly does the resist formulation itself contribute to stochastics, or is it a purely dose-driven effect? Along with the resist the patterning stack has a more significant effect in EUV patterning Due to the thickness decrease in the resist and the underlying stack, the interfacial effects of the resist and hardmask films play a dominant factor in the material stochastics. This offers an opportunity to think differently about underlayer design for sub-32nm pitch patterning. The choice of hardmask can be used to modulate post-litho defectivity to mitigate the stochastics effects and enable more efficient pattern transfer. This paper will address multiple approaches to improving the materials stochastics through resist component optimization and hardmask film development. It will also demonstrate how the methodology of defectivity at post-exposure and post-etch are correlated to electrical yield to validate material evaluations", "Polymeric materials with an imaging chemistry based on the main chain cleavage under the influence of photogenerated acid are a promising resist platform for EUV lithography. Backbone scission resist materials are, in principle, capable of creating very small structures due to the fact that the removing parts can have dimensions in the order of the monomers that they consist of. Nevertheless, in the case of the commonly used non-chemically amplified materials of this type, issues like sensitivity and poor etch resistance limit their applications, whereas inadequate etch resistance and non-satisfactory process reliability are the usual problems encountered in acid-catalyzed materials based on main chain scission. In this work, we report on optimization of the formulation of new high-sensitive polymeric materials for EUV lithography by tuning the ratio between the photoacid generator (PAG) and the base quencher. In our material design, the acid-catalyzed chain cleavable polymers contain very sensitive acid-labile bonds in their backbone while they remain intact in alkaline ambient. These photoresists were evaluated with several PAG and base quencher (BQ) loadings. The PAG ratio spans from 4% to 7% with respect to polymer weights, whereas the BQ ratio tuned to 5%, 10%, and 15% with respect to PAG weight. High-performance patterning capabilities were achieved for linesspaces down to 22 nm half-pitch using EUV interference lithography. We report linewidth roughness versus dose-to-size for 25 nm and 22 nm half-pitch for different PAG and BQ loadings and provide a comparison.", "The development of Chemically Amplified Resists (CARs) for Extreme Ultra-Violet Lithography (EUVL) requires unique molecular and macromolecular design considerations. The combination of photon-induced variation effect coupled with material and processing variabilities makes stochastic consequences in EUV resist significantly more severe than that in ArF resist. Among the other factors, conversion of the scarce number of absorbed EUV photons into imaging events is directly modulated by acid generation quantum yield. In this study, we measure the EUV acid generation efficiency of different Photoacid Generators (PAGs). Our results show that in addition to PAG electronic properties, other structural-driven PAG properties can have a significant impact on resist sensitivity. In a complementary part of this study, we have measured PAG acid generation efficiency under EUV exposure in newly designed polymer matrixes. Such polymers comprise high absorption EUV elements and EUV-specific sensitizers. Insights into the effect of the polymer matrix on EUV acid generation quantum yield are presented.", "The development of EUV resists is one of the major challenges for the deployment of high-NA EUV lithography, which is on the roadmap for high-volume manufacturing of future semiconductor technology nodes. Resist performance is admittedly governed by a resolution-roughness-sensitivity (RLS) tradeoff. This study reports on the EUV resist progress achieved during the last year in the framework of the resist screening program by PSI and ASML. An extensive performance characterization of different resists was carried out using the XIL-II beamline EUV interference lithography (EUV-IL) tool at the Swiss Light Source (SLS). We present the upgraded screening metrology used in 2020 at PSI enabling increased confidence in results. We report material performance towards patterning lines/spaces features with respect to the key parameters of RLS: half-pitch (HP), dose-to-size (DtS), line-width-roughness (LWR), as well as Z-factor for overall performance consideration. General progress in EUV resist development is reviewed by considering several resist platforms available today from different vendors. Different molecular and chemically amplified resist materials are demonstrated as viable for 16 nm resolution technology nodes. One chemically-amplified resist vendor shows suitable materials for 13-nm-resolution technologies while exhibiting potential for further downscaling. We present different metal-oxide resists screening with resolutions down to 10 nm HP. We finally discuss the overall progress of materials achieved between 2019 and 2020 towards reaching high-NA.", "Inpria has pioneered the development of high-resolution metal oxide (MOx) photoresists designed to unlock the full potential of EUV lithography. In addition to resolution, LWR, and sensitivity to enable advanced process nodes, there are also stringent defectivity requirements that must be realized for any resist system. We will review advances in post-etch defectivity based on: resist design and formulation, track process design, developer design, and etch optimization. We will present data supporting each of these topics quantifying the defect impact and will describe improvement strategies to take full advantage of such MOx resist systems.", "Improved lithography resolution provided by EUVL simplifies the patterning process and makes it possible to use less restrictive design rules. This in turn enables cost effective scaling with extendibility. There are several technical challenges and infrastructure gaps that need to be resolved to make EUVL suitable for high volume manufacturing (HVM). These gaps relate to development of a stable and reliable high power EUV source, EUV resist and EUV compatible photomask infrastructure. Realization of Actinic patterned mask inspection (APMI) capability is a critical component of the required Photomask infrastructure [1,2]. Most critical enabler of actinic patterned mask inspection technology/capability has been the EUV source. In this contribution, we will discuss key aspects of the developed High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM) worthy LPD EUV source for APMI. These include performance aspects such as brightness and spatial position stability of the EUV emission, dynamics of the EUV-emitting plasma and long-term stability of the source", "Anamorphic mask design is necessary to overcome the geometrical limitation imposed by the reflective geometry used in EUV lithography projection systems and will be used in high-NA EUVL scanners. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of anamorphic imaging using CDI. We created anamorphic EUV masks with programmed defects and inspected it with RESCAN, a lensless microscope dedicated to EUV mask inspection.", "With the introduction of the NXE:3400 scanner, EUV has progressed to High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM) for sub-10nm lithography. In this context, manufacturers are pursuing a dual-path approach towards near-zero reticle defectivity: EUV-compatible pellicle or zero particles towards reticle by advanced particle contamination control. However, given the high cost of reticles, it is equally important to establish tooling and processes for cleaning the reticle should a particle land on it. To this end, we investigated an extension of the existing MeRiT mask repair product line to also address particle defects. The resulting tool for particle removal leverages the MeRiT know-how on defect repair using e-beam based repair schemes with a novel in-situ manipulator to remove particles, including real-time observation by SEM (scanning electrode microscopy). This paper will focus primarily on a feasibility study, successfully demonstrating proof of principle of defect removal, reviewing the area of interest by SEM and showing no collateral damage being observed by SEM-EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray) analysis.", "EUV exposure stochastics remains a key limiter in driving lower dose and better economics for scaling EUV patterning implementation. In particular, the stochastics translates to resist defects that become detrimental to device performance and yield. There has been development and innovation in plasma etch to mitigate these defects during the pattern transfer process \u2013 key challenge to achieve high selectivity to EUV resist mask while etching the patterning layers. Advanced pulsing solutions as well as deposition-based approaches have been characterized and developed. This paper will delineate the various approaches, including the benefits and risks associated with each, in relation to the plasma etch requirements needed for the pattern transfer for current and future process nodes.", "In 2015 IBM announced the first 7 nm test chip patterned with Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) technology, enabling 36nm back end of the line (BEOL) metal pitch and self-aligned contact. Five years later, EUV has become the mainstream enabler for 7 nm node manufacturing, including the recent announcement of IBM Power10 high-performance chip. The high-performance definition of this technology, essential to IBMs server chips, has unique requirements that push the process complexity even further. In this paper, we will review some of the challenges and patterning solutions that will allow successful implementation of high-performance design definitions. We will also discuss our current efforts to extend the use of single expose EUV in the printing of interconnects to a second node, over a multi-patterning scheme, by replicating our strategy of co-optimization across all contributors to patterning success. We will review a few examples of this approach, including resolution improvements of our latest NXE3400 EUV system, all of which have allowed us to realize significant yields for our transistor interconnects at 28nm pitch. The entitlement of each process and material will be gauged through a robust characterization methodology that includes an understanding of the defect mode modulated, as well its ultimate correlation to electrical yield.", "For many years traditional 193i lithography has been extended to the next technology node by means of multi-patterning techniques. However recently such a 193i technology became challenging and expensive to push beyond the technology node for complex features that can be tackled in a simpler manner by the Extreme UltraViolet Lithography (EUVL) technology. Nowadays, EUVL is part of the high-volume manufacturing device landscape and it has reached a critical decision point where one can push further the single print on 0.33NA full field scanner or move to a EUV double patterning technology with more relaxed pitches to overcome current 0.33NA stochastic limits. In this work we have selected the 28nm pitch dense line-space (P28) as critical decision check point. We have looked at the 0.33NA EUV single print because it is more cost effective than 0.33NA EUV double patterning. In addition, we have conducted a process feasibility study as P28 in single print is close to the resolution limit of the 0.33NA EUV full field scanner. We present the process results on 28nm dense line-space patterning by using Inpria\u2019s metal-oxide (MOx) EUV resist. We discuss the lithographic and etching process challenges by looking at resist sensitivity, unbiased line edge roughness (LER) and nano patterning failures after etching (AE), using broad band plasma (BBP) and e-beam (EB) defectivity inspection tools. To get further understanding on the P28 single patterning capability we have integrated the developed EUV MOx process in a relevant iN7 technology test vehicle by developing a full P28 metallization module with ruthenium. In such a way we were able to carry on electrical tests on metallized serpentine, fork-fork and tip-to-tip structures designed with a purpose of enabling further learning on pattern failures through electrical measurements. Finally, we conclude by showing the readiness of P28 single exposure using Inpria\u2019s MOx process on a 0.33NA EUV full field scanner.", "We evaluated the printability of patterns relevant for Logic Metal at P28nm (L/S and T2T) on wafer using EUV single expose. We compare illumination sources with and without fading correction as well as Bright field / Dark field mask tonalities and NTD MOR / PTD CAR resist. In simulations, Bright field (BF) imaging gives better image quality than Dark field (DF) at small pitch/CD. It also enables smaller T2T. To avoid tone inversion (assuming dual damascene processing), BF imaging requires the use of a NTD resist. On wafer, exposure latitudes increase for a BF/NTD choice, concurrent with simulations, even after correcting out SEM shrinkage. Also, T2T CD is reduced. In terms of illumination, we compare dipole sources to fading corrected sources. As fading correction, we have both induced aberrations (Z6-corrected dipole) and monopoles. As expected, a fading correction significantly reduces best focus differences of L/S through pitch and T2T. Moreover, the Z6-corrected dipole is optimal to print small T2T with better uniformity. Finally, we observe that PTD and NTD MOR resist utilize the same aerial image differently. NTD resist can leverage pupil shapes with high exposure latitude, but low depth of focus, better than PTD resist. Fading correction via induced aberrations naturally produces such sources. In summary, the preferred option is a Z6-corrected dipole for best focus alignment and sharp T2T, together with BF imaging to allow higher L/S exposure latitudes and small T2T. Combining this choice with NTD MOR resist avoids tone inversion and leverages the illumination source optimally.", "Gate all around stacked nanosheet FET\u2019s have emerged as the next technology to FinFET\u2019s for beyond 7-nm scaling. With EUV technology integrated into manufacturing at 7nm, there is great interest to enable EUV direct print patterning for nanosheet technology in the FEOL. While sheet and gate pitches expected for the beyond 7nm node fall within the EUV direct print regime (>40nm), it is unclear if direct print solutions can meet device performance requirements at technology critical sheet widths and gate lengths. Here, we demonstrate electrical performance of nanosheet FET\u2019s with 20 \u2013 80 nm wide sheets with 40-150 nm pitch gates patterned with single expose EUV. We compare results against a benchmark double patterning process towards meeting variability, device and critical dimension targets. We also explore the limits of process and material knobs - resists, illuminations and etch chemistries with the specific goal of reducing LER/LWR and towards shrink for further scaling. Our results demonstrate crossover points between direct print EUV and double patterning processes for nanosheet technology and identify relevant design guidelines and focus areas to successfully enable EUV for the FEOL in nanosheets.", "The purpose of our study is to evaluate the benefit of contrast enhancement strategies on a logic metal layer at pitch 28 nm. We build up on three studies from imec and ASML [1][2][3]. We take as a reference a Negative Tone Development (NTD) Metal Oxide Resist (MOR) process used in combination with a binary TaBN mask absorber, without SRAF, exposed with an X/Y symmetric pupil on a 0.33 NA EUV scanner, the NXE:3400 from ASML [7]. The fading mitigation strategies leverage asymmetrical pupil (monopole), wavefront injection (Z6 aberration) and low-n attenuated Phase Shift Mask (PSM). We find very good agreement between our simulations on design clips, the theoretical expectations and the experimental data shared in the above mentioned papers on building blocks (L/S through pitch and dense tip-to-tip). Overall the three fading correction techniques are efficient to improve the printability of our use case in term of ILS. It also improves the best focus shift of L/S through pitch and between L/S and tip-to-tip. In conclusion, the most promising exposure strategy for the logic metal pitch 28 nm use case is the attenuated PSM. It provides the highest ILS, the narrower best focus range, the largest overlapping process window without any compromise on the illumination efficiency, i.e. using the full NXE:3400 throughput.", "As the semiconductor industry continues pushing Moore\u2019s law to the next node, interconnect structures scaling will be a key element to performance improvement of functional devices. However, the requirements for low LCDU and defectivity of these interconnect structures have become more stringent with continuous scaling. In this paper, a fundamental study is conducted to understand the impact of various factors on the patterning of EUV single exposure vias, and to find effective strategies to shrink CD while improving LCDU and defectivity. The work is based on a 40 nm pitch orthogonal via array baseline, and probes different patterning factors including illumination, resist materials, stack, scanner, and develop methods for LCDU improvement and defectivity reduction. The patterns are transferred to bottom dielectrics to study the evolution of LCDU and defectivity during etching.", "After years of effort, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is finally in production for 7nm technology node and beyond. The 7nm node is the first generation where EUV has been employed to replace a few critical multi-patterning immersion layers in the product. While EUV lithography has helped to overcome some challenges in multi-patterning immersion lithography in advanced nodes such as process complexity and pattern uniformity, it has also brought about new challenges. In this paper, we choose the EUV contact layer as an example to describe how to insert EUV in a 7nm FPGA product to simplify the process and improve product performance. We select the EUV contact layer because it can improve the transistor performance by lowering the contact resistance with EUV\u2019s reduced Edge Placement Error. We demonstrate how to tackle EUV contact defectivity, variability, and integration from a production point of view through the FPGA embedded memory CRAM. CRAM failure signatures and behaviors can be used to debug the contact related defects and monitor the contact resistance variation in the product. Combined with physical-failure-analysis (PFA) results on failed EUV contacts and CRAM characterization data, foundry can fine tune the EUV contact process to reduce contact defects and contact resistance variation. After a few iterations, our product achieves a stable and low-resistance EUV contact process with a significant reduction in contact failure rate.", "The application of the ethyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (ETMAH) as alternative developer solution for EUV lithography was investigated (compared to the tetramethylammonium hydroxide or TMAH standard developer). Early reports have shown that at a specific or optimal developer concentration of around 0.20N the ETMAH developer allows mitigation of resist-based stochastic defects (increase in stochastic defect margin) while maintaining lithographic performance. Results obtained here suggest that with the use of a non-ionic surfactant additive for the ETMAH developer solution LWR reduction was achieved (compared to TMAH). This improvement in LWR was achieved while preserving resolution, sensitivity, and stochastic defect margin.", "Chemically amplified resists have been used in the EUV lithography. The basic additive, called a quencher, has been added to the resist formula to control acid diffusion. In this study, the effects of photodecomposable quencher (PDQ) concentration on the chemical gradient (an indicator for LER) in chemically amplified EUV resist processes were investigated. The chemical gradients were simulated on the basis of the sensitization and reaction mechanisms for different half-pitchs, sensitivities, photoacid generator (PAG) concentrations, PDQ concentrations, and the effective reaction radii for deprotection. The simulation results analyzed using least square, lasso, Ridge, and elastic net regressions are discussed.", "Research on carbon nanotube (CNT) films for the EUV pellicle application was initiated at imec in 2015 triggered by the remarkable optical, mechanical, and thermal properties of the CNT material. Today the advancement of the CNT material synthesis together with matured methods to fabricate thin CNT membranes make free-standing CNT films a very promising EUV pellicle candidate for high volume EUV lithography. Balancing the CNT material properties for the optimal pellicle performance in EUV scanners remains the ongoing research focus. Depending on the density and morphology of the CNTs within the film and individual CNT parameters, like number of walls, bundle size, metal catalyst content, purity etc., the optical and thermal properties of the CNT pellicle can be tuned. It is critical for the pellicle to be stable in the EUV lithography scanner environment which includes hydrogen plasma and heat loads associated with high powers beyond 250 W. Different types of CNTs, i.e. single-, double-, multi-walled CNTs and their combinations, are explored as building blocks of an optimized pellicle membrane. Optical properties of different pellicles and their ability to withstand high EUV powers in the hydrogen-based environment were tested. Transmission, spectroscopic and chemical composition mapping of the exposed free-standing CNT films are used to study the material changes that occur in the scanner-like environment. A solution is needed to extend the CNT pellicle lifetime and coating is discussed as a potential approach to protect the CNT material from hydrogen plasma damage.", "EUV lithography has recently been implemented in high volume wafer production. Consequently, maximizing yield is gaining importance. One key component to achieve optimal yield is using a pellicle to hold particles out of the focal plane and thereby minimize the printing of defects. The Carbon Nano Tube (CNT) pellicle is a membrane consisting of a network of carbon nanotubes, and demonstrated EUV transmission up to 98%. The challenge is to balance the CNT material parameters for optimal performance in the EUV scanner: low probability for particles to pass, low impact on imaging through scattered light, high durability in the scanner environment, while maintaining high transmission. We report results of the first full-field CNT pellicle exposures on an NXE EUV scanner. We demonstrate handling of the pellicles on the scanner, without breakage, and provides a first assessment of their imaging behavior. Multiple single- and double-walled uncoated CNT pellicles with EUV transmission up to 97.7% were exposed on the NXE scanner at imec, and minimal impact on the imaging is confirmed. In these exposures, uncoated CNT pellicles were used which will not meet the specifications regarding lifetime. Therefore, current ongoing developments focus on CNT coating and durability in scanner environment. The presented demonstration proves the value of a CNT-based EUV pellicle solution.", "Wafer fab mask inspection is facing new challenges in the era of Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL). Mask qualification methods in use for ArF lithography are reticle verification based on wafer prints or defect inspection on Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) mask inspection tools. The latter is the industry preference in most cases. To implement this established methodology for EUV masks with pellicle, the pellicle must have transmission that enables inspection for defect detection. In this work we test the viability of a DUV mask inspection platform to image and inspect an EUV mask with a Carbon Nanotube (CNT) based pellicle [1]. Pellicles are used to keep particles off the patterned side of the photomask. For DUV and longer exposure wavelengths, polymers with transmission above 99% are routine. For EUV wavelengths, identifying a transparent, mechanically robust film that is compatible with EUV exposure environments has been challenging. Commercially-available EUV pellicles for lithography are p-Si based[2]. This pellicle type achieves the critical protection of the mask but induces a significant productivity loss due to EUV light absorption. The critical need for a highly-transmissive pellicle will increase with advanced nodes that put more pressure on uniformity specifications and throughput. In this arena, CNT based pellicles exceed the required transmission for High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM) and show promise towards production adoption [3]. DUV light absorption is relevant for mask inspection. DUV light is absorbed by the p-Si pellicle, while the CNT has high transmission in this wavelength region as well, making mask inspection of EUV masks with pellicles possible on existing DUV inspection tools, such as Applied Materials Aera5TM. In order to understand the impact of CNT pellicle on DUV inspection, a controlled study was performed by Applied Materials in cooperation with imec. The study consisted of various system measurements and extensive application qualification. Aera5TM inspection results on a Programmed Defect Mask (PDM) with a full field CNT pellicle will be presented. The results with pellicle are comparable to the reference no-pellicle inspection and meet the same detection sensitivity. Detection optimization Best-Known Methods (BKM) developed on EUV masks without pellicles proved to be effective. These include, but are not limited to, aperture shaping, defocus and polarization. Moreover, the imaging and main system components performance were examined, and no impact was observed.", "EUV lithography is introduced in semiconductor fabrication processes, which makes maximizing yield and throughput increasingly important. One key component is the use of a high-transmission pellicle to keep particles out of the focal plane and thereby minimize their impact on imaging. Imec initiated the development of a promising pellicle approach based on a network of carbon nanotubes (CNT), which has the advantage of many tunable structural parameters to form a pellicle membrane. A balance between membrane robustness and particle non-permeability on one side and low EUV absorption and membrane scattering on the other, must be found. The membrane scatter is important for EUV flare effects during wafer printing. Therefore, it is important to verify its magnitude experimentally as a function of the tunable CNT structural parameters. However, this measurement can be very challenging for low-flare requirements. In this work, the EUV scatter measurements on CNT-based pellicle membranes have been performed and optimized in a stand-alone irradiation setup at RWTH Aachen University. Membranes with different CNT structures and network parameters are investigated, as well as membranes with protective coatings. These measurements, in combination with scattering calculations and printing performance, can serve as a guideline on acceptable scattering levels for industrial applications.", "In the past year ASML NXE pellicle has made a significant steps. ASML EUV Customers can order in volume pellicles, which meet all the production KPI. The next step to meet the industry high volume manufacturing requirements, is releasing high EUV transmittance, high power compatibility and superior imaging performance membranes, made of novel materials. In this presentation we will give a comprehensive overview on the current development status of the NXE pellicle product, including a future outlook to the EUV pellicle roadmap.", "Background: Decomposing an observed variation in critical dimension (CD) into its sources of variation is an important analysis, but it is often tedious and prone to error. For EUV processes, identifying the magnitude of stochastic variations is especially important and relevant. Aim: An automated process for decomposing CD errors into its sources will aid in the analysis of a specific EUV process. Approach: MetroLER offline metrology software has been updated to perform automated sources of variation analysis, including the measurement and subtraction of systematic and random components, such as across-SEM-field signatures and random metrology errors. Results: For a staggered array of 24 nm contacts holes on an 80X46 nm pitch, the total CD uniformity (CDU) of about 3.3 nm included a global CDU across wafer of about 1.0 nm, a systematic mask contribution of 1.7 nm, systematic metrology contribution of 1.0 nm, and a random metrology contribution of 0.67 nm (all 3\u03c3), leaving a stochastics-only CDU of about 2.6 nm. Conclusions: Careful consideration of the systematic and random components in CD measurement variations enables measurement of the stochastic contribution to a state-of-the-art EUV contact printing process. The contribution of metrology error", "An algebraic model and simulation with the Multivariate Poisson Propagation Model (MPPM) are used to investigate the formation and extrapolation with dose of missing contact defects due to inherent inhomogeneity in on-average uniform resist component densities. A Poisson model of both local roadblocks as well global initial clearing of contacts is derived. When fit to the 2019 experimental data from Maslow et al. this model becomes nearly Gaussian and with 400 equivalent effective dissolution aiding events NEff. A dose 9% higher than the central Bossong process window dose reduces the error rate to 10-13. Fitting revealed that the asymptotic scaling behavior is present at error rates of 10-1 and thus measuring less than a million contacts at doses of 80% to 95% of normal is likely adequate. An algebraic expression to interpret NEff is derived in terms of the averages and variances of exposure, acid generation, base, and deprotection in the Post-Exposure Bake (PEB) process. The model assumes concentration independent Poisson generation rates and greatly simplifies when averages are substituted for Poisson variances. The variance in EUV exposure dominates as it is inherited by acid and deprotection neither of which is Poisson. The large NEff is attributed to regional sharing due to acid movement. MPPM simulations of the PEB time-evolution include the behavior of averages and variations of species with saturation or their disappearance with depletion, the volumetric reduction of variance by acid motion, and the mitigation of a local programmed doubling of the quencher base.", "The quality of any lithographic pattern is dependent on the photon absorption events that a photoresist pattern receives during exposure and subsequent molecular events. The failure probability is not governed by the stochastics of any one process and is conditional on multiple stochastic and conventional variations (such as resist thickness). These processes jointly result in the observed distribution with multiple pathways resulting in the same rare event. This paper will examine how probabilistic processes combine to form rare defects so that these defects can be predicted and corrected. Rigorous simulations will be used to study the distributions and will be applied to existing stochastic compact model forms.", "With the adoption of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for high volume production in the advanced wafer manufacturing fab, defects resulting from stochastic effects could be one of major yield killers and draw increasing interest from the industry. In this paper, we will present a flow, including stochastic edge placement error (SEPE) model calibration, pattern recognition and hot spot ranking from defect probability, to detect potential hot spot in the chip design. The prediction result shows a good match with the wafer inspection. HMI eP5 massive metrology and contour analysis were used to extract wafer statistical edge placement distribution data.", "Photon absorption statistics combined with a simple model of resist chemistry triggered by each absorbed photon leads to a family of stochastic models with a Gaussian Random Field deprotection. Two important aspects of such models are discussed. First, the generalizations to stochastic reaction-diffusion models, accounting for the effects of depletion, and to models accounting for both exposure-resist stochastic and other process parameter variations, are presented. Second, several options for the stochastic metrics of EUVL processes, both meaningful and useful for lithographers and fast enough to be applicable to the full chip OPC and verification, are described, and some details of their implementations for the full-chip OPC verification and the results of tests are presented. The relation of one of the introduced stochastic metrics to the stochastic-caused variability of the electrical conductance of vertical interconnects (vias) is explained.", "Multiple ASML NXE:3400C scanners are installed at customer factories and being used in high volume manufacturing (HVM) of leading semiconductor devices. The latest generation of NXE:3400C sources has improved performance and availability by implementing a modular vessel concept and an automated tin supply system. In this paper, we provide an overview of 13.5 nm tin laser-produced-plasma (LPP) extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) sources enabling HVM at the N5 node and beyond. The field performance of sources operating at 250 watts power including the performance of subsystems such as the Collector and the Droplet Generator will be shown. Progress in the development of key technologies for power scaling towards 420W will be described.", "Gigaphoton develops CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source which is the most promising solution as the 13.5nm high power light source for HVM EUVL. Unique and original technologies including; combination of pulsed CO2 laser and Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser pulses for shooting and debris mitigation by magnetic field have been applied. We have developed first practical source for HVM; \u201cGL200E\u201d 1) in 2014.

The cleaning process uses hydrogen radicals and ions (formed in the hydrogen plasma) to interact with Sn-coated surfaces, forming SnH 4 and being pumped away. This technique has been used to clean a 300mm-diameter stainless steel dummy collector optic, and EUV reflectivity of multilayer mirror samples was restored after etching Sn from them. Previous experiments have shown etch rates of greater than 10 nm/min over a 2 inch diameter circular plasma area with an SWP launcher. An etch experiment was conducted with a sweep over sample bias to investigate the influence of hydrogen ions. Radial etch rates for each hydrogen ion energy were measured using profilometry. Langmuir probe and radical measurements were also taken. Langmuir probe measurements of the surface wave plasma show a two temperature distribution for electrons: a bulk temperature of 2.3 eV and some population at 8.6 eV. The bulk electron density was measured to be 2.7e11 cm -3 . Radical probe measurements give the hydrogen radical density at 1.96e15 cm -3 . A COMSOL model of this experiment was also built and simulation results will be presented. In this work, experiments elucidating the fundamental processes of tin removal are conducted by varying pressure, power, surface temperature and gas flow rate. The ion bombardment reduces the number of radicals needed to etch a single tin atom to the range of -. The linear SWP antenna yields plasma densities on the order of and radical densities on the order of , allowing for greater utilization of ion etch enhancement. Etch rates of up to 200 nm/min have been achieved. The surface temperature of the samples is an important factor in the etching process such that decrease of the surface temperature increases the etch rates and decreases the hydrogen desorption rates. In addition, a kinetic etch model is developed to explain the behavior of the etch rates as function of the surface temperature. Furthermore, results from experiments performed in Illinois NXE:3100 chamber will be discussed.", "Metal-organic systems have shown great promise as EUV resists. They have demonstrated good sensitivity and etch resistance while maintaining high resolution and low line edge roughness, making them a potential pathway to modify the tradeoff between resolution, line edge roughness, and sensitivity common to organic chemically amplified resists. In particular, tin-based systems have attracted significant interest and the two known families of fab-ready metal organic resist are based on organotin compounds. Part of this interest derives from the high EUV absorption cross-section of tin, but an equally important driver is the unique chemistry of the element, which affords a multiplicity of coordination environments and a tin-carbon bond stable with respect to hydrolysis, yet sensitive to cleavage by ionizing radiation. Realizing the patterning potential promised by these empirical properties will require a better understanding of the fundamental chemistry behind them, and has already motived several academic and industrial investigations. In this contribution we continue our previous work to develop a deeper understanding of tin-carbon bond chemistry with quantum chemistry using the well-known Sn12 \u201cfootball\u201d cluster archetype. We demonstrate the consistency between our computations and experimental data. And then we move on to explore a more detailed description of ionization and electron attachment induced chemistry. Investigations of electronic structure would shed light on what chemical reactions can happen subsequently.", "As target feature sizes for EUV lithography shrink, it is becoming ever more important to understand the intricate details of pattern formation in these materials. One such frontier that is garnering more attention is the role of the \u201cthird dimension\" involved in the patterning process- the dimension perpendicular to the wafer. With resist thicknesses shrinking to accommodate ever narrower linewidths, small changes in resist performance in this dimension will have a greater overall effect on pattern quality, particularly as the thickness of these resists approaches target pattern dimensions. To understand the effect that the third dimension has on resist performance, and in particular the interplay between the third dimension and resist stochastics, we have developed a 3D version of the multivariate Poisson propagation model. As a test case for the model, we explore the role of acid diffusion in the so called third dimension on a set of 105 vias, showing that increased z blur yields an improvement in both dose to size and pattern uniformity without sacrificing resolution.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Imprint lithography is an effective and well-known technique for replication of nano-scale features. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) manufacturing equipment utilizes a patterning technology that involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. The technology faithfully reproduces patterns with a higher resolution and greater uniformity compared to those produced by photolithography equipment. Additionally, as this technology does not require an array of wide-diameter lenses and the expensive light sources necessary for advanced photolithography equipment, NIL equipment achieves a simpler, more compact design, allowing for multiple units to be clustered together for increased productivity. Previous studies have demonstrated NIL resolution better than 10nm, making the technology suitable for the printing of several generations of critical memory levels with a single mask. In addition, resist is applied only where necessary, thereby eliminating material waste. Given that there are no complicated optics in the imprint system, the reduction in the cost of the tool, when combined with simple single level processing and zero waste leads to a cost model that is very compelling for semiconductor memory applications. DRAM memory is challenging, because the roadmap for DRAM calls for continued scaling, eventually reaching half pitches of 14nm and beyond. For DRAM, overlay on some critical layers is much tighter than NAND Flash, with an error budget of 15-20% of the minimum half pitch. For 14nm, this means 2.1-2.8nm. DRAM device design is also challenging, and layouts are not always conducive to pitch dividing methods such as SADP and SAQP. This makes a direct printing process, such as NIL and attractive solution. The purpose of this paper is to review the performance improvements related to overlay, resolution and pattern transfer. Improvements in overlay include control methods such as imprint force, mask to wafer tip/tilt and pneumatic controls at the wafer edge. We also introduce the pattern transfer scheme used to etch features with half pitches below 20nm.", "The integration of a NIL into production for advanced memory devices will require compatibility with existing high-end optical lithography processes in order to meet the aggressive overlay performance specifications. To deliver such a demanding overlay specification, it is necessary for NIL to achieve reliable alignment and to expand its overlay error budget to include as many as higher-order error components along with their countermeasure options.

For more than a decade, we have been developing Jet and Flash Imprint Lithography (J-FIL) technology and challenging critical issues such as defect density, overlay, and throughput. J-FIL is an efficient process for transferring template pattern having large variations in pattern density. However, it has the intrinsic limitation of lower throughput due to resist dispensing time prior to imprinting of every single field on the wafer and the spreading process of resist drops, slow diffusion of bubble trapped at the resist drop-boundaries. To eliminate the above mentioned steps and improve throughput, we have developed a spin coating NIL (SCN) process in which a uniform resist layer is spin coated on the entire wafer. Identification of defect generation mechanism assuming Washburn\u2019s model of capillary flow, has led us to optimize SCN process and thus achieving a higher throughput with lower defect density as compared to that of the J-FIL process. We will show the defect density and throughput performance of SCN process, and the possibility of introducing SCN in device production.", "Nanoimprint lithography, NIL, has been developed for semiconductor lithography technology. Recently three dimensional imprint such as dual damascene pattern fabrication by NIL is proposed. For fine feature templates, double patterning process is proposed for template fabrication.

This UV-based imprint, using a transparent stamp is now a standard technology and the most common option for the full wafer imprint, meaning the size of the stamp correspond to the size of the wafer to print. Previous work has shown promising results with strong repeatability and uniformity in terms of critical dimension (CD)2. In 2017, larges features, bigger than 500 nm period, and shallow aspect ratio were qualified3. Latter in 20194, lithography and etching through a Si/SiO2 stack were demonstrated for 25 wafers imprinted in a single run: - Depending on several diameters contact (from 100 to 50 nm) and densities (from 1:3 to 1:15). - For line and space arrays with a density of 1:4 and variable spaces widths (from 100 to 50 nm). In this paper we demonstrate that the limit of the patterns dimension can be pushed to sub-50 nm features thanks to EVG SmartNIL technology, the optimized EVGNIL-UV/AS2 soft stamp material with matching resist as well as the improvement of pattern transfer by dry etching. Based on CDSEM metrology, and SEM cross-sections, high fidelity and reproducibility were demonstrated, with 25 replications in a single run using the same soft stamp. Transfer compatibility of the imprint material was validated until 45 nm line, with 1:4 density.

Most current methods for transferring 3D microstructures to large substrates involve either multiple sequential deposition and imprinting steps with sacrificial materials to define voids, or lamination of a series of two-dimensionally patterned layers. These techniques have limited throughput and present significant layer-to-layer registration challenges. We introduce a design for an optical patterning system that has the potential to create 3D microstructures in a photopolymer film with a single patterning step on a roll-to-roll web. The technique builds on the process of Computed Axial Lithography that we have recently introduced. In the proposed technique, time-evolving, projected patterns of collimated light illuminate a photopolymer film on a web where it rotates around a backing cylinder. The rotational motion of the web allows each point in the film to be illuminated from many angles sequentially. During the rotation, therefore, a 3D light dose distribution can be synthesized tomographically, with the ability to define 3D polymerized structures which may include re-entrant and encapsulated features. Here, we describe computational modeling of the expected spatial resolution, geometrical fidelity, and patterning speed with this method for relevant photopolymer materials.", "Roll-to-roll and other high-speed printing manufacturing processes are increasingly being extended to micro- and nano-electronics and photonics due to cost and throughput advantages as compared with traditional wafer-scale manufacturing. The extra degrees of freedom associated with a moving web require high speed, in-line metrology to control the manufacturing process. Many state-of-the-art metrology approaches have sub-10 nm resolution but cannot be implemented during real-time fabrication processes because of environmental constraints or contact/cross sectional requirements. Optical angular scatterometry is a non-contact metrology approach that can be implemented at high speed. We demonstrate a system that uses 45\u00b0 off-axis parabolic mirrors and an 8kHz resonant scanner to vary the incident/reflected angle from ~17\u00b0 to ~67\u00b0, suitable for nanoscale metrology at web speeds of up to 350 cm/s, well-beyond the speed of current manufacturing tools. Scatterometry is sensitive not only to gross defects (missing pattern sections) but also to variations in nanoscale pattern details, offering a pathway to feedback control of the manufacturing process.", "UpNano has enhanced the 2PP process in 3D printing to increase the throughput by factor of up to 100, and enables for the first time batch and small series production of high-resolution micro parts. An optimized optical system, a powerful 1-Watt femtosecond laser and the patented writing mode \u201cAdaptive Resolution\u201d are the key innovations of the NanoOne system. This system provides a writing speed of up to 1500 mm/s in combination with a low-magnifying 4x objective, resulting in a throughput of over 200 mm3/h.", "The present work use direct laser writing (DLW) system for fabrication of large area patterning of microstructures. Micro sized square pattern of 1\u03bcm size with 2\u03bcm spacing were successfully fabricated on 1500 x 1500 \u03bcm2 large area Si substrate. The developed microstructures found potential application in colloidal nanotweezers manipulation of plasmonic devices. The results shows precision in large scale micro patterning using DLW system and claimed a faster and simple process in patterning microstructure compared to electron beam (e-beam) lithography process. The developed micro patterning are dry etched using RIE to convert SiO2 pillar of 500 nm height with tip diameter of 250 nm to fabricate the helical structures which found potential applications in nanoplasmonic devices.", "As feature sizes shrink, state-of-the-art patterning has to meet three critical challenges: The ability to print patterns at tight pitch, the ability to accurately place patterns with respect to each other (edge placement error or EPE control) and the ability to deal with pattern variations induced by photon and resist stochastics. While extreme-UV lithography (EUV) with NA 0.33 can now routinely print sub 30 nm pitch line and space patterns and improve pattern placement by reducing the number of required overlay steps, the industry needs to invent complementary patterning techniques for continued pitch scaling with EUV. Complementary patterning methods like spacer-based pitch division have allowed the industry to break the Rayleigh resolution limit of 193 nm wavelength immersion lithography and pitch division of EUV patterns will allow the industry to scale pitch well below 20 nm. However, as the target pitch scales, variations in the critical dimensions (CD) of line and space patterns caused by photon and resist stochastics will absorb a significant portion of the EPE budget. Directed self-assembly (DSA) is a powerful patterning technique to pattern dense, periodic features with low number of defects and with pattern uniformity not readily achieved by optical lithography alone. DSA offers a fundamental EPE advantage over spacer-based pitch division since the line and space CDs are chemically encoded into each molecule with unprecedented accuracy. Additionally, ease of pitch scaling and low process complexity are well-documented features of DSA processing. However, since the pitch of the DSA-defined line/space pattern is determined by the molecular weight of the polymer, we have been unable to deploy DSA to flexible design rule applications that require multiple pitches and multiple CDs. In this paper we will report on process flows that use DSA to rectify a complex, multi-pitch and multi-CD pre-patterns printed with EUV. We will describe how material selection, EUV exposure, and processing conditions impact the type of complex patterns that can be rectified and highlight opportunities for materials development to make this powerful complementary patterning technology become a reality.", "Design rules for block copolymer (BCP) materials used in directed self-assembly (DSA) to meet the constraints for manufacturing were defined in a combined experimental and theoretical approach to quantitative three-dimensional characterization of nanoscale structure and analysis of defect annihilation kinetics and mechanisms. Subsequently we developed a materials platform based on (A-block-(B-random-C) architectures to satisfy those design rules to enable current and future patterning resolution requirements. We realize feature size-specific BCPs (18 to 8 nm full pitch) with balanced block surface energies between blocks for thermal annealing, controllable segregation strength for simultaneous optimization of defectivity and dimensional uniformity, and etch selectivity.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymer thin films remains a promising alternative to achieve the resolution gains needed to enable dense patterning with sub-10 nm critical dimensions (CD). Yet, some significant challenges remain. Among others, two challenges stand out: one relating to the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions that lead to finite defect densities while the second relates to a scalability challenge to harness simultaneous gains in both resolution metrics: minimum line width and minimum pitch. Here we present a self-registered self-assembly process that employs a two-step DSA to address both the energetics of defect formation and the scalability limitations to achieve simultaneous gains in both pitch and line width when compared to the guiding patterns.", "Improvements in ordering kinetics and pattern diversity are needed to make block copolymer directed self-assembly (BCP DSA) a route to cost-effective, large-area nanomanufacturing. This talk will highlight recent research in BCP DSA with these goals in mind. First, I will describe how self-templating in layered BCP thin films produces new 3D pattern symmetries. Second I will show how chemical patterning can be used to locally select between coexisting cylinder and lamellae morphologies in BCP blends. Finally, I will discuss the use of homopolymer plasticizers to accelerate ordering, enabling self-assembly at the > ~100 nm scale relevant for optical dielectric metasurfaces.", "Direct Self-Assembly (DSA) is expected to be applied to patterns below 20 nm, and many applications have been proposed along with several lithography techniques. The advantage of DSA is that the molecular weight of the polymer can control the pattern size and achieve a fixed pattern pitch. On the other hand, the DSA process faces the technical challenges of pattern defects, line edge roughness (LER), and pattern transfer to the underlying layer. Tokyo Electron has reported the results of these improvements in the past SPIE. This report introduces each optimization method and shows you the next steps.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) has emerged as one of the most promising, cost-effective paths to continue scaling semiconductor devices down to the sub-10nm regime. While the lithographic guidelines and thermodynamic properties of the block co-polymers ultimately dictate the pitch (typically 20nm+), for full realization of the potential within high volume manufacturing (HVM), all of the nanometer-level resolution requirements still need to be met by dry etch. This talk will summarize the current impediments faced regarding critical dimensions (CDs), line roughness, and defectivity as well as ongoing work to overcome these obstacles.", "Block copolymer self-assembly is showing great promise for extending the resolution limits of established, high-throughput photolithography techniques. This technology has the potential to broadly enhance device capabilities ranging from magnetic data storage media to photovoltaic cells to semiconductors. This talk will highlight the journey towards the development of new materials, including synthesis and characterization, and new processing protocols for controlling their thin film structures. Finally, perspectives for their future implementation into commercial lithographic patterning processes will be given.", "EUV lithography requirements continue to present new challenges and opportunities for multi-beam mask writer. Driven by sub-10nm node mask requirements for higher resolution, CD uniformity, pattern placement accuracy, lower line edge roughness (LER), and zero writer-induced defects, the multi-beam mask patterning technology must keep the pace, continue to innovate, and work hand-in-hand with mask makers to overcome these challenges to meet the mask and wafer manufacturing metrics and requirements. In this paper we will review some of these challenges from the mask maker point of view. Also, we will shed light on a bigger challenge of transitioning to curvilinear mask ILT (Inverse Lithography Technology) data structure and the support needed from multi-beam writer to handle large data volume. Processing and managing this large growth of data helps the mask industry speed up the process of adapting to this technology and enabling EUV mask and wafer manufacturing reach its ultimate goals.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is introducing for manufacturing of advanced semiconductor devices in last year to re-accelerate \u201cMore Moore\u201d. EUVL for 7nm logic node process has begun at the starting point and is expected to spread to cutting-edge processes for 5nm node and beyond down to 2nm node or so. One of key technologies of EUVL is photomask manufacturing technologies that requires higher resolution, more precise accuracy and better productivity. To get the solution, DNP has installed a Multi-Beam Mask Writer (MBMW). The MBMW tool is equipped with 262-thousand programmable beams, a 120-Gbps data-path, and an air-bearing stage, with sub-nm precision. With this system, DNP has developed the EUV mask process with the low-sensitivity and high resolution resist for EUV lithography capable of 5nm node processes and beyond. MBMW also proves that its writing strategy is useful for patterning the very complex features, such as the curvilinear patterns, with 1x nm resolution and reasonable throughput. In this presentation, we will discuss MBMW and its process capability of EUV mask application, e.g. local CD uniformity, minimum resolution, image placement accuracy and other applications for nanoimprint template and the curvilinear patterns.", "Multi-beam mask writers (MBMW) offer the potential to enable the use of ideal curvilinear shapes for ILT masks, but current layout formats are not sufficient to represent complex ILT designs efficiently from OPC through mask making. In the 2019 BACUS conference, we proposed the formation of a data format working group to address the need for curvilinear data representation for MBMW. The Curvilinear data format working group was first initiated in October 2019 with participation from EDA companies and advanced mask makers. In this paper, the necessity of a new curvilinear data format and our working group will be introduced. We will discuss the progress and the plan of the working group.", "EUV Lithography makes substantial progress in optimizing (i) tool, (ii) mask blanks, and (iii) resist materials to support the next generation EUV imaging performance. Novel EUV masks use a variety of absorbers and capping layers fabricated on mirroring multilayer stacks coated on ULE substrate. 50 keV electron multi-beams are used to write high-resolution patterns in an appropriate resist coated over the absorber layer stack. The main goal of multi-beam mask writing (MBMW) has been the precise geometry control and faithful reproduction of the intended pattern on the substrate. The highly conform MBMW resist-patterning process needs to understand the absorbed intensity distribution from the electron scattering in the resist/substrate stack, as well as the consecutive radiation-chemical effects induced by the electron energy spread together with the nonlinear dissolution behavior of the resist. It is difficult to exactly calculate the relative contribution of these factors separately, but their overall effect can be modeled by the analytic 'point spread' response function (PSF) for the resist. The ultimate resolution is determined by the amount of laterally- and back-scattered electrons from specific target compositions. These interaction events cause proximity, fogging, local heating, and surface charging effects, defining the accurate pattern. Simulations have shown alterations in the absorbed energy distributions of EUV masks with different stacks, and the experiments approved the results from the calculations. We present results of resist response to the electron multi-beam exposure based on statistical numerical simulation on different EUV-stacks directly compared with the corresponding numerical lithographic parameters extracted from the experimental resist screening. Consequently, all input parameters for MBMW writing corrections were precisely specified to the corresponding absorbed energy distribution signature of the concrete EUV mask. The experiments were performed with the IMS MBMW-101 ALPHA tool in a high dose positive-tone chemically amplified resist (pCAR), provided by FUJIFILM, and coated on experimental EUV masks containing different novel stack compositions as prepared at HOYA Corporation.", "Plasmonic lithography breaks the diffraction limit by utilizing the otherwise lost evanescent fields produced by light sources with wavelengths close to or within the visible spectrum. With the lower cost of high-power femtosecond laser systems, plasmonic lithography opens a new approach towards the next generation semiconductor manufacturing. In the past years, we have demonstrated different types of plasmonic lithography, ranging from Superlens, Flying plasmonic lens, to Hyperlens, and successfully achieved 22nm half-pitch resolution. Hyperlens, made of hyperbolic metamaterials, stands out for its capability of exposing a large field of view while maintaining a good resolution. Although the resolution of the Hyperlens is inversely proportional to the unit cell thickness of metamaterial, fabrication of thin metal layers has long been a challenge. We report in this study an ultrathin Hyperlens that permits the propagation of unprecedented high spatial frequencies, 12ko, through the metamaterial. This hyperbolic metamaterial consists of alternating metal and dielectric materials with thickness as thin as 2nm, which potentially leads to patterning with sub-10 nm resolution.", "Axial cosinoidal structured illumination that the intensity along the axis presents a cosinoidal distribution plays important role in many fields, such as optical tweezers, optical micromanipulation and optical modulation. However, the generation of axial cosinoidal structured illumination with controllable phase and period is a challenge. Here, we propose a novel method for generating axial cosinoidal structured illumination by using phase-only spatial light modulator. We implemented axial cosinoidal structured illumination using holographic technique. The computer generates two concentric circular slits with different radius, a prism phase is applied on the slits to tilts the beam that incidents on the slits away from the optical axis. Different annular beam produce Bessel beams with different axial wave vectors, axial cosinoidal structured illumination can be obtained from the interference between two Bessel beams. We theoretically and experimentally verify that the method can effectively generate axial cosinoidal structured illumination.", "High performance, high speed processing, and miniaturization of electronic devices are advancing, due to the rapid development of highly advanced information society in recent years. Semiconductors continue to be highly integrated according to Moore's law, and semiconductor package substrates are also required to be miniaturized and highly densified. The build-up method is one of the methods for miniaturization and high density of semiconductor package substrates. The build-up method is method of alternately forming insulation layers and conductor layers on both sides of a glass epoxy substrate. In general, an organic build-up film is used for the insulation layers, and a via is formed in the insulation layers by laser processing. However, the miniaturization of the organic build-up film process by the commonly used 355 nm UV laser has almost reached the limit due to its long wavelength. Therefore, to miniaturize the build-up film process, it is necessary to use excimer laser with shorter wavelength than the UV laser. We are developing the processing of organic build-up film by 248 nm excimer laser with free spectrum operation. The organic build-up films are processed directly by the irradiation using the mask by 248 nm excimer laser. We processed using Ajinomoto build-up films (ABF) as organic material. The type of ABF was GY50. We confirmed that it is possible to process via of 3 \u03bcm in build-up film and the DOF can be increased depending on the process conditions. We will report on the processability of build-up film using 248 nm excimer laser.", "Origami has gained attention in the microfabrication community as it has enabled applications including micromirrors, encapsulation devices, and microgrippers. Yet, fabrication methods for origami systems available at millimeter and sub-millimeter scales are of narrow scope with product-specific synthesis strategies. Therefore, generalized fabrication methods for origami at these scales emulating additive manufacturing are of great interest. The small length scales of these systems require the implementation of self-folding or assisted folding methods as the fabrication approaches. In this work, a self-folding method and an assisted folding method are demonstrated as origami fabrication strategies. Single-layer films of photopolymer with patterned properties along their in-plane domain are used to create the planar precursors of the origami structures. The properties of the films are patterned by controlling their crosslinking density via a double-exposure photolithography process. For the assisted folding method, surface tension of a droplet is used as the actuation mechanism. Compliant fold regions made of less-crosslinked photopolymer connect relatively stiffer face regions. Upon depositing a droplet on the films, bending deformation localized at the compliant folds is enabled. For the self-folding method, the photolithography process is devised such that developer solution is inhomogeneously absorbed throughout the cross-section of the fold regions. This inhomogeneity in concentration leads to local bending when the developer is released via heating. This diffusion-based self-folding method allows for programming of the folds to attain targeted fold angles. Both methods, enabled by patterned films produced using double-exposure photolithography, show promise for freeform fabrication of millimeter and submillimeter origami systems.", "A multi-beam mask writer MBM-2000 is developed for the 3 nm technology node. It is designed to expose EUV blanks with beamlets of total current 1.6 uA at high throughput. It also supports writing leading-edge photomasks by equipping a correction function for glass thermal expansion and high-speed data path. Fast writing modes are provided for middle-grade photomask writing. Inline function of pixel level dose correction (PLDC) is implemented to reduce mask turnaround time by replacing offline corrections with PLDC, with additional benefit of fidelity improvement by dose enhancement. In this paper, writing results of MBM-2000 are reported and discussed.", "Imec\u2019s AttoLab is the first industrial laboratory capable of watching the ultrafast dynamics of photoresists following 13.5 nm, EUV exposure, and for emulating high-numerical-aperture (high-NA) exposure on 300-mm wafers using two-beam EUV interference. The two respective beamlines are powered by a laser-based high-harmonic generation EUV source. Its capabilities have recently been proven by imaging 20 nm pitch lines and spaces using Lloyd\u2019s Mirror interference lithography. In parallel, time-averaged and time-resolved techniques for studying the ultrafast dynamics of photoresists after EUV exposure, coherent diffractive imaging to study resist interfaces, and more sophisticated interference lithography techniques for printing sub-22 nm pitches on full 300-mm wafers are being developed. Taking advantage of the bright and short EUV pulses now available at imec, we will be able to contribute to a smooth transition towards next generation high-NA lithography.", "Recently, imec has installed and commissioned an industrial, ultrafast EUV materials characterization and lithography lab, imec\u2019s AttoLab, with a primary aim to explore limits of photoresist performance and their associated ultrafast chemistries. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, the use of a table-top, high-harmonic EUV system (KM Labs, XUUS4) to perform interference lithography of sub-22-nm pitch patterns in an Inpria MOx resist via a Lloyd\u2019s mirror interference lithography (IL) tool. Analysis of SEM images enables us to identify potential sources of image blur, which we attribute to out-of-sync vibrations, flare, spectral purity, and laser stability. Nevertheless, these results confirm the ability of table-top, high-harmonic EUV sources to print lithographic patterns below a 22-nm pitch. In future work, we plan to investigate sub-20-nm patterning in different resist formulations, as well as expand the lithographic capabilities in AttoLab to perform IL on full 300-mm wafers.", "DNA offers a high degree of programmability that enables the synthesis of highly structured 2D and 3D materials on the 10-100 nanometer scale using the technical approach called DNA origami. These materials can also be scaled to fabricate micron- and millimeter-scale hierarchical materials that preserve their nanometer-scale structural features. Either form of DNA-based material can be converted to inorganic materials including silica, or used to spatially organize secondary molecules including chromophores, quantum dots, peptides, and proteins for a diverse array of applications in patterning, photonics, excitonics, and medicine.

In the second part of my talk I will present applications of these structured nanoscale materials to program multiplexed optical barcodes, quantum logic gates, and vaccines using quantum dots, chromophores, and proteins, respectively, organized spatially on the nanometer-scale.", "Conventional top-down nanofabrication, over the last six decades, has enabled almost all the complex electronic, optical and micro-fluidic devices that form the foundation of our society. Parallel efforts, exploring bottom-up self-assembly processes, have also enabled design and synthesis of structures like quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and unique bio-molecules that possess technologically relevant proper- ties unachievable top-down. While both these approaches have independently matured, ongoing efforts to create \u201chybrid nanostructures\u201d combining both strategies, has been fraught with technical challenges. The main roadblock is the absence of a scalable method to deterministically organize components built bottom-up within top-down nanofabricated structures. In this talk, I will first introduce a directed self-assembly technique that utilizes DNA origami as a molecular adaptor to modularly position, and orient, bottom-up nano-components (like quantum dots, light emitters and proteins) within top-down nanofabricated devices. I will then present experimental results demonstrating the utility of the technique to achieved absolute, arbitrarily scalable, control over the integration of discrete emitters inside optical devices. Finally, I conclude by presenting my vision of how a DNA origami based bridge between top-down and bottom-up nanofabrication can enable a range of highly transformative, and functional, devices. Specifically, I will present data demonstrating arrays of single-photon sources, method for extremely economical nanotexturing as well as a modular molecular interface between biology and solid-state.", "The ability to organize nano-components into the desired architectures with targeted properties can enable a broad range of nanotechnological applications, from energy materials to information processing. However, we are currently lacking an adaptable and broadly applicable methodology for the bottom-up 3D nanofabrication of desired nanoscale structures.

We are using hydrogen-based scanning probe lithography to enable deterministic placement of individual dopant atoms with atomically aligned contacts and gates to fabricate single atom transistors, devices for single electron spin manipulation, and arrayed devices for analog quantum simulation research. Atomic precision devices, where individual atoms or electrons fundamentally affect device performance, bring about a variety of new manufacturing and metrology challenges. Single atom defects and charge instability deeply change device performance, affecting reliable manipulation and sensing of individual electrons. Conventional metrology methods such as transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy often prove inadequate at this length scale and new, challenging electrical test methods are needed.", "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are attracting significant interests in the nanoelectronics community due to their various electrical properties, atomic-scale thickness, and mechanical flexibility. The current challenge to fabricate high performance 2D materials-based electronic devices is the poor quality of the metal contacts, the difficulty to pattern dopants, and the high fabrication cost. To overcome these challenges, here, we show that using thermal scanning probe lithography (t-SPL), record performing high-quality metal contacts can be fabricated cost-effectively on 2D materials, resulting in high performance 2D materials-based field effect transistors. Moreover, we show that by integrating t-SPL with a gas flow chamber, t-SPL can be used to achieve nanoscale bipolar doping of 2D materials. This t-SPL method opens a new way to cost-effectively fabricate high performance 2D materials-based nanoelectronic devices and can be easily scaled up using parallel probe arrays.", "In this paper, we describe approaches for the fabrication of single atom devices and spin-based qubits for quantum computing. Addressing of single dopant atoms has the potential to enable precise tunable control over all key electronic properties of basic devices needed for solid-state quantum computing. A new challenge which arises for a variety of qubits is the ability to locate deterministically individual atoms below the surface of the three-dimensional structure to build single or few-atom atom transistors single electron transistors, or diverse quantum sensing devices. Comprehensive applications can be considered for complex donor/acceptor arrangements and this kind of dopant engineering technique has the character of a lithographic method.

In addition, the difficulty of process monitoring also leads to the increased cost because of the increased failure rate of the device. Despite of impressive advancements in metrology and inspection field, metrology issues keep growing over the device generations, while cost of the operation is getting worse due to the increased equipment price and lower throughput. Now, the metrology techniques reached physical limitations for using the next-generation semiconductor products based on nanoscopic 3D structures. In particular, reliably covering and monitoring the various process splits in the R&D fab becomes very challenging due to the lack of non-destructive 3D measurement technology. Without an innovative in-fab metrology solution, current monitoring technique must be relying on the destructive analysis, those are time-consuming and expensive.

The motivation behind this paper started with engagements with semiconductor suppliers as well as automotive manufacturers, where KLA witnessed many clear examples of killer defects passing through test with the potential to enter the automotive supply chain. The current method to drive towards \u201cZero Defect\u201d levels of chip quality involve two main approaches: process control and electrical test screening. The industry is poised for a new complementary solution that combines the unique detection of physical defects from the production line with the 100% coverage of electrical test, providing high speed inspection on the most critical reliability layers covering 100% of lots and 100% of wafers to look at each individual die for screening purposes, rather than just controlling the process. By inserting a complementary inline inspection screen, Inline Part Average Testing (I-PAT) can help stop maverick wafers and isolate very defective die. Over the last 2 years KLA has executed proof-of-concept studies for I-PAT using a prototype engineering system. These studies have been conducted at 5 automotive semiconductor integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and foundries, including logic devices with embedded memory, analog devices, and power semi devices of both silicon and silicon carbide, spanning from 40 to 350nm design rules. The data sets include information on 1.6 million chips to create a meaningful statistical modeling approach. Two case studies are presented that illustrate the effectiveness of inline die screening.

With the advent of AI, and big data end markets further diversified to IOT, communications, self-driving cars, power, and sensors, resulting in demand for computing that ski-rocketed to the trillions. To fuel this growth PPACt :Power, Performance, Area-cost and time-to-market needed to accelerate. This acceleration is enabled by new architectures, 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink, and advanced packaging. An obstacle limiting this growth was identified as loss of correlation between the new aforementioned semiconductor device structures, and the measurements conventional optical workhorse metrology provided. This was not a one-time calibration event. Optical metrology increased reliance on accuracy check, ground truth and calibration is a result of increasing optical metrology accuracy gaps over time, causing inflating edge placement error budgets, instability in litho to etch bias and non-zero offset over time. A paradigm shift in overlay, CDU, and edge placement error patterning control metrology was sought to accelerate PPACt at needed yield. This talk tells the story of how to introduce a new standard to a needing industry. We start with addressing the need for a new technology enabling a fast non-destructive accurate inline metrology, we then validate its accuracy overtime using two different industry standard reference metrologies. And we conclude with testimonies of chipmakers showcasing the use of the new industry standard of patterning control. To enable high throughput accuracy in overlay, EPE, and NZO metrology a highly efficient BSE see-through ebeam technology was introduced and benchmarked against optical metrology. Showing reduced non zero offset residuals on device, with the capability to accurately gauge litho-to-etch bias. As a good engineering practice STEM and Delayer techniques validated the accuracy of the inline ebeam technology so it could become the new workhorse to assume the role of HVM overlay metrology. We conclude with three chipmakers case studies of how the use of the new workhorse ebeam metrology accelerated cycles of development, reduced reliance on destructive metrology enabling faster process splits in fabrication of three dimensional nanosheet transistors, faster ramp of semiconductor manufacturing and better yield by better on device overlay and NZO at HVM.", "High Voltage SEM (HV-SEM) is now becoming more common in typical fab usage for achieving \u201csee-through\u201d overlay and detecting buried defects. To improve understanding of capabilities and limits, JMONSEL is used to simulate HV-SEM imaging of various buried test structures to explore how apparent resolution depends on incident beam energy, target and overlayer material, and overlayer material depth, thus improving understanding of HV-SEM\u2019s limits in terms of what can be seen at what energy through how much overlayer, which is important for use case consideration and optimization.", "Overlay control has been one of the most critical issues for manufacturing of leading edge semiconductor devices. Scanning electron microscope-based overlay (SEM-OL) metrology can directly measure both overlay targets and actual devices or device-like structures with high spatial resolution. SEM-OL uses small structures which allows insertion of many SEM-OL targets across a die. Precise overlay distribution can be measured using dedicated SEM-OL mark, improving measurement accuracy and repeatability. To extend SEM-OL capability, we have been developing SEM-OL techniques that can measure not only surface patterns by critical dimension SEM but also buried patterns for leading edge device processes.", "We show that an overlay (OVL) metrology system based on a scanning electron microscope can achieve accurate registration of buried and resist (top) structures. The positions were determined by both Back Scattered Electrons (BSE) and Secondary Electrons (SE). The accuracy was quantified for After-Development Inspection (ADI) of an advanced EUVL process. Results by linear tracking showed accuracy below 0.4nm, robust across process variation and target designs. The influence of various measurement conditions, e.g. Field of View, on position and OVL tracking was negligible. The measurement methodology presented is applicable for both standalone High Voltage SEM (HV-SEM) registration targets and optical targets, such as the Advanced Imaging Metrology (AIM\u00ae) target used by Imaging Based Overlay (IBO) metrology systems. Using SEM ADI OVL results as a calibration for optical overlay metrology tools we can demonstrate significant improvements in the optical ADI OVL accuracy on small targets like AIM in-die (AIMid).", "An after etch overlay measurement on device is typically used as a reference overlay as this is what determines the final overlay. The delta between on target overlay from after develop (ADI) and this reference overlay on device after etch (AEI) is known as the metrology to device offset (MTD). As the fab overlay is controlled by a run-to-run control of ADI overlay, it is preferred to minimize the MTD. The MTD concept in overlay metrology has long been present in the industry and many ways to mitigate this problem have been adopted (such as designing overlay target at ADI that has a similarly low aberration response as the device, or dialing in a static offset between ADI and AEI overlay, etc.). As overlay margins continue to shrink, existing methods start to show gaps and are insufficient to suppress the MTD to an acceptable level on the few most critical overlay layers. In order to address this gap, we need to deploy a much wider solution space that provides an integrated design-lithography-etch solution. In order to characterize the MTD, (assuming that target design in ADI has already minimized aberration response delta between target and device), it is important to understand that there are two major components to MTD: (1) an inaccuracy in ADI overlay (metrology artifacts mostly due to the presence of target asymmetry) and (2) etch to litho offset due to any post ADI added effects such as etch induced expansion and/or stress release etc. However, the above two components are strongly coupled and traditional characterization methods have difficulty in separating their contribution to the measurement. In this technical paper we will discuss novel methods (data driven as well as model-based) to decouple these and multi-lot results will show that MTD can be further minimized compared to traditional static correction between ADI and AEI.", "Tool Induced Shift (TIS) is a measurement error commonly used to measure the accuracy of metrology tools. TIS manifests in the difference in overlay (OVL) misregistration between measurements of the same target at 0\u1d3c and 180\u1d3c rotations. This inaccuracy is attributed to tool asymmetries and is commonly caused by lens aberrations, lens alignment, illumination alignment and the tool\u2019s interaction with target asymmetries. TIS impacts tool Total Measurement Uncertainty (TMU) and tool-to-tool matching. In memory chips, particularly 3D NAND, TMU is limited by TIS distribution across wafer, as it depends on process stability and is amplified by high layer topology. Additionally, TIS is influenced by wafer-to-wafer and lot-to-lot process variation. TIS correction by direct measurement per site (TIS-onLink, ToL) incurs a heavy penalty to measurement throughput as it requires measuring each site twice. Alternatively, measuring TIS on a sparse subset of sites, interpolating to other sites (TIS-on-Parent, ToP), induces a lower throughput penalty but is not accurate enough in many cases. In a previous paper we introduced a new methodology to improve overlay measurement with minimum throughput impact - Modeled-TIS (mTIS). This approach uses Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict per-site TIS correction on Image-Based Overlay (IBO) measurements. This method gives near ToL TIS correction performance at ToP throughput penalty, or better, depending on the use case. In this paper, we describe some of the algorithmic adaptations we made to the original algorithm to work in a high-volume manufacturing (HVM) environment and present results of an HVM use case on 3D NAND production lots.", "This presentation will examine at a high level the future for in-line high volume manufacturing (HVM) metrology for the semiconductor industry. First, we will take a broad view of the needs of patterned defect, critical dimensional (CD/3D) and films metrology, and present the extensive list of applications for which metrology solutions are needed. Progress will be shown in terms of the IEEE-IRDS roadmap. We will then report on the gating technical limits of the most important of these metrology solutions to address the metrology challenges of future nodes, highlighting key metrology technology gaps requiring industry attention and investment.", "We propose a novel spectrum measurement system named Microsphere-assisted nanospot spectroscopic reflectometry (MASR) by using the super-resolution image over the Rayleigh\u2019s resolution limit in white-light. The proof of concept and optimal configuration of MASR are fully verified by utilizing both FDTD and ray optics simulations. At the same time, we experimentally validate the usefulness of MASR by obtaining the spectra from extremely small spot of 210 nm which is 119X smaller than 25 \u03bcm of conventional spectrum measurement system due to 530X super resolution enhanced magnification by optimally using microsphere that is definitely overcoming the physical limit of the optical resolution. It is important to note that the proposed technique has a capability to measure the spectrum from the extremely tight area, diameter of 210 nm, resulting in monitoring in-cell uniformity and structural changes in narrow and small area device patterns. Furthermore, our system can be combined with various optical measurement systems as a module which can upgrade optical resolution and magnification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the world first demonstration of completely new concept of the system and the method to overcome the metrology challenges we are currently facing.", "The inspection of thin-film thickness on a wafer is one of the key steps for the semiconductor manufacturing processes. This paper proposes estimating the film thickness profile of the wafer, where the 3-band RGB color imaging camera and the hyperspectral imaging module are utilized to achieve the robust metrology performance. The simulation results are designed for investigating the characteristics of estimated film thickness profiles based on the Gaussian process regression. We demonstrate this cost-effective solution is beneficial for monitoring the CMP process with small computational power. The proposed measurement method has a great potential to solve bottlenecks from the physical metrology processes.", "A new instrument called CASTOR is operated at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility and is dedicated to the characterization of thin films with thicknesses in the nanometer range. The instrument can combine X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements with fluorescence (XRF) acquisitions and especially total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) related techniques such as grazing incidence XRF (GIXRF). The instrument is now routinely installed on the hard X-ray branch of the Metrology beamline and reproducibility is studied as well as reference-free GIXRF analysis. Some representative examples are given to illustrate the capabilities of the setup and of the analysis.", "The ever-increasing complexity of materials and architectures in nanoelectronics devices has driven the demand for new high-resolution imaging methods. Specifically, for three-dimensional (3D) analysis of confined volumes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been recently explored as a method for tomographic sensing. Here, we report on the innovative design of a dedicated microscopy solution for volumetric nanoscale analyses that achieves tomographic AFM by using a novel multi-probe sensing architecture. First, we describe the development of a custom scan head that is based on an exchangeable multi-probe hardware. Second, we demonstrate the use of our machine for tip-induced material removal in thick SiO2. Finally, we perform a tomographic reconstruction of nanosized poly-Si vertical channels, considered here as a prototypical system for vertical memory cells.", "Metrology of the properties of materials is a growing concern in semiconductor manufacturing and as a result, new and existing technologies are being adapted to address gaps in established capabilities. We introduce here Scanning Microwave Impedance Microscopy (sMIM), a technology that can measure critical material properties such as dielectric constant (k-value), capacitance, resistivity and permittivity at the nanoscale. In this technique, an AFM cantilever is used as a microwave source to measure the electrical properties of materials at nanometer scale. sMIM is sensitive to the local capacitive and conductivity changes in a material making it an excellent method to apply on a wide range of materials such as insulators, semiconductors, ferroelectrics and other. An sMIM measurement provides the permittivity and conductivity of films. From this measurement you can derive properties such as dopant concentration, resistivity and identify certain defects. Since microwaves can penetrate deep into the sample, we can measure sub-surface layers as well. The resolution of the sMIM ScanWave system for capacitance measurements has been calculated to be better than 0.3 aF and the repeatability is well below 1% RSD 1\u03c3 making suitable for very sensitive process control of dielectric films and dopant concentration. Types of measurements presented here include nano C-V for dielectric film quality, dielectric film k value and dopant concentration. Additional applications are envisioned in emerging memory materials.", "Coherent Fourier scatterometry (CFS) via laser beams with a Gaussian spatial profile is routinely used as an in-line inspection tool to detect defects on, for example, lithographic substrates, masks, reticles, and wafers. New metrology techniques that enable high-throughput, high-sensitivity, and in-line inspection are critically in need for next-generation high-volume manufacturing including those based on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Here, a set of novel defect inspection techniques are proposed and investigated numerically [Wang et al., Opt. Express 29, 3342 (2021)], which are based on bright-field CFS using coherent beams that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). One of our proposed methods, the differential OAM CFS, is particularly unique because it does not require a pre-established database for comparison in the case of regularly patterned structures with reflection symmetry such as 1D and 2D grating structures. We studied the performance of these metrology techniques on both amplitude and phase defects. We demonstrated their superior advantages, which shows up to an order of magnitude higher in signal-to-noise ratio over the conventional Gaussian beam CFS. These metrology techniques will enable higher sensitivity and robustness for in-line nanoscale defect inspection. In general, our concept could benefit EUV and x-ray scatterometry as well.", "To fix the root cause of electrical failure chips, we do failure analysis by an electrical test. However, this analysis takes much long time because an electrical test is done after a few months since the defect occurred in in-line processes. To reduce the analysis time, we used the defects detected by in-line optical inspections of post semiconductor process steps. In order to identify the position of the defects that caused the failure, we used to match CAD contour with a DR-SEM (Defect Review-SEM) image contour of the defect. But the \u201chit rate\u201d of the defect was not so high. Here hit rate is a rate that the defects cause an electrical failure chip. There were two reasons. First, the matching success rate was low because extracting contour from SEM is inaccurate. Second, CAD was a mask pattern and didn\u2019t include the circuit node information, so there was an over-detection such as a short between dummy nodes. We propose a high precision in-line schematic failure analysis technique by machine learning and circuit node information. For matching pixel to pixel, we match Fake-SEM generated by GAN instead of CAD with DR-SEM. Next we make the CAD that is added the defect, and a design verification technique LVS generates circuit diagram. When the defect\u2019s diagram is different from reference, we classify the defect cause an electrical failure. We confirmed that this technique could dramatically improve classification accuracy of the defect of root cause in manufacturing with our memory device.", "Some over-etch (OE) related defects in semiconductor device processing are only obvious after vias or trenches are already filled. Such defects are usually buried and often discovered after failure analysis from failed devices. Inline detection by physical means using optical inspection tools is not possible. e-Beam inspection has the ability to detect this type of defect electrically. OE related defects create shorts or leakage paths and their ability to cause device failure depends on the level or extent of this leakage. Hard OE fail impacts yield while marginal OE is relatively harmless. e-Beam inspection detects both hard OE fail and marginal OE as bright voltage contrast (BVC) and it has always been a challenge to discern yield impacting hard OE fail from the relatively harmless OE based only on the defect images. TEM analysis is often necessary to distinguish between the two. In this paper attempt is made to relate the extent of OE to e-Beam defect detection parameters, Threshold (TH) and Grey Level (GLV). Correlation between the amount of OE and each of the two parameters is established. Also a correlation is found among the two parameters themselves. With these relationships established, the e-Beam defect detection parameters alone can be used to predict OE\u2019s potential impact on yield without TEM analysis.", "EUV and DUV reticles are inspected before exposure to guarantee the quality of the lithographic process. The pellicle and the reticle back side are typically inspected for the presence of contaminants which are several micrometers in diameter. While detection of macroscopic particles is fairly straightforward, delineation between particle and stray light due to diffractive properties of reticle pattern is challenging. We present a particle detection system based on structural illumination technology capable of automatic delineation between contaminants and stray light. During measurement a series of images is acquired by a macro-imaging optical detector (e.g. camera) positioned normal in reference to the investigated sample. The surface under test is illuminated at an oblique angle by an incoherent polychromatic projection system projecting a pattern whose temporal frequency changes across the inspected surface. The signal acquired by the detector is in general an incoherent sum of light scattered by particles with stray light returned by the diffractive pattern. Temporal samples of intensity data are analyzed pixel by pixel in the Fourier domain and the particles are differentiated from the stray light by comparing the Fourier spectra of the acquired signal with the frequency a particle should generate at an analyzed pixel based on the system geometry. Thus, unwanted stray light signal contributions are separated from particle signal by performing logical operations on the signal in the Fourier domain. Experimental results from a technology demonstrator are provided to illustrate performance.", "SEM image processing is an important part of semiconductor manufacturing. However, one difficulty of SEM image processing is collecting enough defect-containing samples of defect-of-interests (DOI) because many DOIs are very rare. This problem becomes more prominent for Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) based image processing techniques since they require large amount of samples for training. In this paper, we present a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based defect simulation framework to tackle this problem. The fundamental insight of our approach is that we treat the defect simulation problem as an image style transfer problem. Following this thought, we train a neural network model to turn a defect-free image into a defect- containing image. We evaluate the proposed defect simulation framework by using it as a data augmentation method for ML/DL based Automatic Defect Classification (ADC) and Image Quality Enhancement (IQE) on a Line Pattern Dataset, which is collected with ASML ePTMand eScan R series inspection tools from an ASML standard wafer. The experimental results show a significant performance gain for both ADC and IQE. The result proves our defect simulation framework is effective. We expect GAN based defect simulation can have a broader impact in many other SEM image development and engineering applications in the future.", "EUV resists, while improving steadily, generate a number of nanobridge or break defects that increases quickly as the pitch approaches 30 nm. Inline inspection methods are therefore needed to reliably detect patterning defects smaller than 20 nm. Massive e-beam metrology provides the high resolution needed to measure these defects, while remaining compatible with HVM throughput requirements. In this work, we used a direct metal (Ru) etch process, to fabricate EUV-patterned electrical structures in the 32 nm-36 nm pitch range. We demonstrate an almost one-to-one correspondence between the e-beam metrology yield of the structures, and their electrical yield. The e-beam inspection is realized with a large-field-of-view HMI eP5 e-beam system. The match between e-beam and electrical yield shows that our e-beam inspection is able to catch all electrically relevant line breaks, while excluding false flags. These results demonstrate the capability of massive e-beam inspection in predicting electrical yield.", "The characterization of nanostructures and nanostructured surfaces with high sensitivity in the sub-nm range has gained enormously in importance for the development of the next generation of integrated electronic circuits. A reliable and non-destructive characterization of the material composition and dimensional parameters of nanostructures, including their uncertainties, is strongly required. Here, an optical technique based on grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence measurements is proposed. The reconstruction of a lamellar nanoscale grating made of Si3N4 is presented as an example. This technique uses the X-ray standing wave field, which arises due to interference between the incident and the reflected radiation, as nanoscale gauge. This enables the spatial distribution of the specific elements to be reconstructed using a finite-element method for the calculation of the standing wave field inside the material. For this, the optical constants for the constituent materials of the structure are needed. We derived them from soft X-ray reflectivity measurements on an unstructured part of the wafer sample. To counteract the expensive computation of the finite-element-Maxwell-solver, a Bayesian optimizer is exploited to obtain a most efficient sampling of the searched parameter space. The method is also used to determine the uncertainties of the reconstructed parameters. The homogeneity of the sample was also analyzed by evaluating several measurement spots across the grating area. For the validation of the reconstruction results, the grating line shape was measured by means of Atomic Force Microscopy.", "High-performance memory production requires discovery of process anomalies that affect device performance. Optical metrology can monitor CDs of device structures, but has limited resolution for 3D NAND, especially towards the bottom of high aspect ratio (HAR) structures. Destructive, offline techniques (e.g., cross-sectional SEM, FIB, TEM) can be used for high resolution HAR profile measurement, but are time consuming, offering little statistical feedback for accurate process control. As an alternative, small angle X-ray scattering (CD-SAXS) can measure 3D HAR structures precisely and non-destructively. CD-SAXS has high sensitivity to 3D profiles, including profiles of CD, ellipticity and tilt through the entirety of the channel hole. CD-SAXS is non-destructive and used inline, providing fast time to results for efficient process characterization. In this paper, we will show data from a CD-SAXS system, including high-resolution CD, ellipticity and tilt profiles, and etch depth of 3D NAND channel holes with strong correlation to reference metrology. With this production-ready CD-SAXS system, flash memory CD profiles can be monitored inline for improved time to an optimized channel etch process.", "Through-focus scanning optical microscopy (TSOM) is a model-based optical metrology method that involves the scanning of a target through the focus of an optical microscope. Nanometer scale sensitive information is then extracted by matching the target TSOM data/image to reference TSOM data/images that are either experimentally or computationally collected. The nanometer sensitivity was previously confirmed by several theoretical and optical implementations. However, these studies all involved application to wafer patterns on the top surface. The present study extends the TSOM method to subsurface defect detection and classification without destruction, which becomes extremely important due to increasingly widely employed 3D semiconductor technologies. First, we apply a near-infrared (NIR) beam as illumination light in order to allow defect identification over the entire device depth. In addition, we adopt a model-less TSOM approach since the construction of a TSOM reference database for 3D pattern structures such as 3D NAND flash memory is hardly practical. We therefore employ a comparative TSOM method in which a TSOM data cube/image is compared with an image of an adjacent die or that of a \u201cgolden\u201d die known to be defect free. We report the results of the first application of this method to an Intel 3D NAND flash and show that substantial subsurface defects are detected and classified.", "To control the HAR (High Aspect Ratio) processes for producing 3D memories, a non-destructive and highly accurate measurement method is required. We report simulation results of T-SAXS (Transmission Small Angle X-ray Scattering) measurability analysis to evaluate its measurement capability of profile parameters for typical HAR structures. After that, we discuss T-SAXS extensibility for profile measurements of future 3D memories, based on measurability analysis for various HAR structural models by varying their structural parameters. For the deep depth region which is important for the future 3D memory shape measurement, we confirmed that the HAR structure with its depth = 30 \u03bcm can be measured under the assumed criteria of precision < 1%.", "Multilayer stack height in 3DNAND has reached the limit of the aspect ratio that etch technologies can cost-effectively achieve. The solution to achieve further bit density scaling is to build the stack in two tiers, each etched separately. While lowering the requirements on etch aspect ratio, stacking two tiers introduces a critical overlay at the interface between the stacks. Due to the height of each stack, stress- or etch-induced tilt in the channel holes is translated into overlay. Characterizing and controlling the resulting complex overlay fingerprints requires dense and frequent overlay metrology. The familiar electron beam metrology after etch-back (DECAP) is destructive and therefore too slow and expensive for frequent measurements. This paper will introduce a fast, accurate & robust data-driven method for In Device Overlay Metrology (IDM) on etched 3DNAND devices by making use of specially designed recipe setup targets. Also, potential applications for process control improvement will be demonstrated.", "We have developed a novel in-line solution for the characterization and metrology of high-aspect ratio (HAR) semiconductor structures using transmission small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The solution consists of the Sirius-XCD\u00ae tool, NanoDiffract for XCD (NDX) analysis software and high-performance computing infrastructure. The solution provides quantitative information on the orientation and shape of HAR structures, such as 3D NAND channel holes and DRAM capacitors, and can be used for development and control of the critical etch processes used in the formation of such structures. The tool has been designed to minimize expensive cleanroom space without sacrificing performance with typical measurements taking only a few minutes per site. The analysis is done using real-time regression in parallel to the measurements to maximize the throughput of the solution. We will illustrate the key features of the solution using data from a HAR reference wafer and provide results for hole shape and tilt across the wafer together with complimentary data from other techniques. We will also discuss future opportunities for both stand-alone XCD applications and possibilities of XCD-OCD synergies including hybrid metrology in solving complex high-aspect ratio (HAR) and other applications.", "3D-NAND memory will continue to increase in the aspect ratio of channel holes. High throughput and in-line monitoring solutions for 3D profiling of high aspect ratio (HAR) features are the key for yield improvement. A deep learning (DL) model has been developed to improve the 3D profiling accuracy of the HAR features. In this work, the HAR holes with different bowing geometries were fabricated and a high-voltage CD-SEM was used to evaluate the performance of the DL model. The accuracy and the sensitivity of the DL model was evaluated by comparing the predicted cross-sections with the X-SEM measurement. The results show that the DL model enables the maximum CD (MCD) of the bowing features to be predicted with a sensitivity of 0.93 and its depth position to be predicted with a sensitivity of 0.91. The DL learning model reduced the absolute error of the predicted MCD depth position from several hundreds of nanometers, the error occurring when using the exponential model, to within 100 nm.", "The control and the characterization of semiconductor very fine devices on a wafer are commonly performed by mean of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to derive a critical dimension (CD) from a pair of parallel edges extracted from the images. However, this approach is often not very reliable when dealing with complex 2D patterns. An alternative is to use SEM contour technique to extract all the edges of the image. This method is more versatile and robust but before being implemented in a manufacturing environment, it must demonstrate that it can be matched well with traditional CD-SEM. Aim: The objective of this work is to present a method to evaluate and optimize the CD matching between a reference standard SEM-CD and SEM-Contours. Approach: After describing the metric used to assess the matching performance, we propose to screen some important influent parameters to give an evaluation of the best matching that we achieved with our experimental data. Results: After optimizing the matching calibration parameters and optimizing the selection of the best anchor pattern for the matching we could achieve a 3s-Total Measurement Uncertainty of 0.8 nm and 3.2 nm for 1D and 2D patterns. Conclusions: We established a method to achieve good matching performance that should facilitate the introduction of SEM contour in a manufacturing environment.", "Despite of the fact that thousands of CD-SEM (critical dimension scanning electron microscope) images are acquired in a daily basis in a fab, limited metrology is performed. Usually these images will not serve other purposes after they are collected and measured, but as they are stored, post-process analysis can be applied. Initially, most of these images are used to perform CD metrology, even though many other types of metrics could be extracted from the same images, especially when using contour metrology. In this paper two use cases will be explored, where contour-based image processing is performed on typical inline metrology targets. In both cases, initial intended metric was CD but thanks to contour based image computing, complementary information can be extracted. In the first use case, CD and overlay metrics can be extracted, while in the second CD, etch slanting and asymmetry analysis is performed across the wafer. Contour-based metrology offers new capabilities to dissociate several layers (e.g. via and line) or elements (e.g. top and bottom) in the image so that interlayer and intralayer metrics, other than width dimensions, can be computed. Besides, a solution not integrated in the tool provides excellent versatility to re-process images, thus allowing the obtention of new metrics, which can be very helpful also for retro-analysis.", "2D curvilinear patterns are more and more present in the lithography landscape. For the related devices, the line edge roughness (LER) is, as well as for lines and spaces, a critical figure of merit. In this article we propose to use a dedicated edge detection algorithm to measure LER of 2D curvilinear patterns on CD-SEM images. We present an original method to validate the algorithm, in the context of roughness measurement. It is based on the generation of realistic synthetic CD-SEM images with programmed roughness and a precise PSD analysis flow. We show excellent correlation (average R2 = 0.988) between the input roughness parameters and the measured parameters for both 1D and 2D synthetic images. Using synthetic images for different number of frames, the contour extraction sensitivity to noise is also explored. Finally, the methodology is successfully applied to experimental CD-SEM images for two classes of applications : photonic devices and DSA fingerprint patterns.", "As the development of Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) is progressing toward the sub-10nm generation, the process window becomes very tight. In this situation, local Critical Dimension (CD) variability including stochastic defect directly affects the yield loss, and it is very important to inspect/measure all patterning area of interest on chip for the process verification. In this paper, by combining Area Inspection SEM (AI-SEM) with large Field Of View (FOV) and Die-to-Database-base (D2DB) technologies, we show a comprehensive solution for fast inspection and precise massive CD measurement of EUV characterized features, such as After Development Inspection (ADI) hole pattern, and aperiodic 2D Logic pattern. Also, a big data analysis consisting of multiple CD indices output by AI-SEM, a new process window by multivariable analysis is discussed. Furthermore, Machine Learning (ML) -based inspection and metrology to maximize imaging speed, is also reported.", "A method to perform Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) model calibration that is also sensitive to lithography failure modes and takes advantage of the large field of view (LFoV) e-beam inspection, is presented. To improve the coverage of the OPC model and the accuracy of the after development inspection (ADI) pattern hotspots prediction - such as trench pinching or bridging in complex 2D routing patterns - a new sampling plan with additional hotpot locations and the corresponding contours input data is introduced. The preliminary inspected hotspots can be added to the traditional OPC modeling flow in order to provide extra information for a hotspot aware OPC model. A compact optical/resist 3D modeling toolkit is applied to interpret the impact of photoresist (PR) profiles, as well as accurate predictions of hotspot patterns occurring at the top or bottom of the PR. A contour-based modeling flow is also introduced that uses a site or edge based calibration engine, to better describe hotspot locations in the hotspot aware OPC model calibration. To quantify the improvement in pattern coverage in the modeling flow, feature vectors (FVs) analysis and comparisons between the conventional and the hotspot aware OPC models is also presented.[1] The time and cost of using conventional Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope (CD-SEM) metrology to measure such a large amount of CD gauges are prohibitive. By contrast, using LFoV e-beam inspection with improved training algorithm to extract fine contours from wafer hotspots, a hotspot aware OPC model can predict ADI hotspots with a higher capture rate as compared to main feature OPC model. Presumably, a hotspot-aware modeling flow based on LFoV images/contours not only benefits users by improving the capture rate of the lithography defects, but also brings the advantages to the failure mode analysis for the post-etch stage.", "In this paper, we present the flow and results of contour-based process characterization, modeling and control used for semiconductor manufacturing. First, high-quality contours are extracted from large field of view (FOV) SEM images based on the improved Canny edge detection algorithm. Prior to the contour analysis steps, SEM image distortion correction is performed by using the loworder linear model. When there are repeating cells within one FOV, the N-sigma roughness band of the unit cell is calculated to show the stochastic process variation fingerprint. For SEM images collected from a focus-exposure matrix wafer, the contour-based process window analysis is performed to generate the depth-of-focus map for the full image, enabling precise detection of process window limiting locations. Finally, 3D compact resist models are calibrated by using both inner and outer contours from the same SEM images, which proves to be effective for the prediction of resist top loss related hotspots.", "In semiconductor fabs, top-down critical dimension scanning electron microscopes (CD-SEMs) are key enablers for metrology and process control, and in order to continue to address the increasing metrology requirements of the semiconductor industry, additional applications that exploit the potential of CD-SEM equipment have being developed. More recently, the uses of contour extraction have expanded to encompass other applications that serve newer technologies, such as ILT (Inverse Lithography Technology), photonics, and DSA (Directed Self Assembly), where the characteristics of the 2D curvilinear patterns are such that standard measurement solutions are no longer an option. The applications for these newer technologies have driven the need for highly accurate contour metrology algorithms. In turn, the need for standardization of what is meant by \u201caccurate\u201d contour metrology has emerged. This paper explores the concept of accuracy as it relates to contour metrology and applies the fundamental methodologies of TMU analysis to the problem of finding the best methods of determining contour metrology accuracy. During the development of this methodology, it was discovered that the application of TMU analysis to contour metrology reveals unexpected conceptual challenges that force a deeper understanding of accuracy and how it pertains to contour metrology. The paper resolves these challenges and proposes a standardization for contour metrology accuracy assessment. Results from analysis of the extracted contours validates the usefulness of the proposed accuracy methodology and establishes the quality of the accuracy of the extracted contours.", "CD-SEM images inherently contain a significant level of noise. This is because a limited number of frames are used for averaging, which is critical to ensure throughput and minimize resist shrinkage. This noise level of SEM images may lead to false defect detections and erroneous metrology. Therefore, reducing noise in SEM images is of utmost importance. Both conventional noise filtering techniques and recent most discriminative deep-learning based denoising algorithms are restricted with certain limitations. The first enables the risk of loss of information content and the later mostly requires clean ground-truth or synthetic images to train with. In this paper, we have proposed an U-Net architecture based unsupervised machine learning approach for denoising CD-SEM images without the requirement of any such ground-truth or synthetic images in true sense. Also, we have analysed and validated our result using MetroLER, v2.2.5.0. library. We have compared the power spectral density (PSD) of both the original noisy and denoised images. The high frequency component related to noise is clearly affected, as expected, while the low frequency component, related to the actual morphology of the feature, is unaltered. This indicate that the information content of the denoised images was not degraded by the proposed denoising approach in comparison to other existing approaches.", "Although line edge and line width roughness (LER/LWR) have been key metrology challenges over the last 15 years, the advent of extreme-ultraviolet lithography (EUV) has increased the importance of its measurement and control. Lithographically printed features are now small enough that randomness in resist chemistry and in EUV photon during exposure results in noise in the patterned resist. This not only affects LER/LWR, but also defect density, including missing holes, shifted features, bridged lines and holes, and line shorts, among others. Well before these stochastic induced roughness variations, there have existed various techniques to analyze roughness. These include power spectral density algorithms, methods to account for instrument bias in the data, identify and filter noise, and specify measurement uncertainty. In this work, analysis methods to evaluate LER and LWR spatial wavelengths, including partitioning and filtering out instrument errors, such as noise and probe effects are presented. Our approach is based on wavelet-transform multiresolution analysis. One of the key advantages of wavelet transform over other signal processing techniques are its spatial-frequency localization and multi-scale view of the components of a profile or surface. This allows decomposing the data into different bands based on specific cutoffs and evaluating different approximations and surface-details at each cutoff band. A priori noise and probe information are used to determine and remove instrument-effects from the data, before calculating the unbiased roughness. The strength of this approach is that is it targeted only to specific spatial wavelengths that are associated with instrument noise or artifacts.", "In this study, we developed a methodology to evaluate scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-based line edge roughness (LER) metrology. In particular, we used a metrological tilting atomic force microscopy (tilting-mAFM) as LER reference metrology. We analyzed the height-height correlation function (HHCF) of SEM line-edge profiles combining averaging and unbiased correction methods. The direct comparison of our method with tilting-mAFM enabled a precise evaluation of the SEM-based LER metrology. We demonstrated that a combination of unbiased HHCF and averaging methods with appropriate condition enabled relatively precise measurement of three roughness parameters. We observed that, for precise roughness evaluation, reducing noise in the line-edge profiles is important before performing the HHCF analysis and unbiased correction.", "In the effort of continuing improving patterning strategies for increasing circuit density while reducing dimensions, several challenges regarding patterning fidelity emerge. In recent years, stochastic effects had their relative importance increased, and therefore the need for closely monitoring those effects is also increasing [1]. Among other stochastic effects, within-feature roughness is significant as it can impact circuit electrical behavior, decreasing time and power performance, and even lead to failures. The workhorse method of the industry for measuring roughness is based on top-down CD-SEM (Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope) image. In recent years, methods have been proposed as a way to improve and standardize the roughness measurement [2, 3]. Those methods rely on the obtention of the power spectral density (PSD) from the detected edges of the features in SEM images, in order to determine their roughness. However, one important aspect is the impact of the CD-SEM image acquisition conditions on the limitation of the observed PSD. As the acquisition parameters changes, different frequencies may be more or less observable in a SEM image, potentially leading to errors in the metrology evaluation [4]. The goal of this study is to first, present the impact of the CD-SEM image acquisition conditions in the roughness measurement, and, second, propose a method to determine the validity domain of the roughness measurements as a function of the acquisition conditions. The proposed method relies on a compact SEM image model. For each acquisition condition, the model is calibrated based on experimental SEM images, from several design samples. Using this calibrated model, synthetic SEM images are generated with a known sample, including its programmed roughness signature (input-PSD), which can be a white noise (defined by a constant PSD). The next step relies on a robust-to-noise edge detection algorithm [5], which is then used to compute the PSD by applying the method proposed in [4]. As the input-PSD is known, it is possible to compute the transfer function of the acquisition system [6], for each of the evaluated acquisition conditions. We call \u2018limit-PSD\u2019 the transfer function which may be considered as the signature of the acquisition conditions in the frequency domain. It can be seen as a low-pass filter and it defines the validity domain of the roughness measurements. For each input-PSD (simulated or experimental), if it is \u2018below\u2019 the limit-PSD (within the low-pass filter), the measurement is within the validity domain. If the resulting measurement reaches the limit-PSD, it is not possible to know if some roughness information was lost due to the acquisition conditions. Such relationship is illustrated in Figure 1, presenting one case where the input-PSD is inside the validity domain and a second case where the actual roughness is underestimated. Thanks to the produced results, the information of different acquisition conditions and detected roughness can be obtained and stored in what we call condition tables. For each acquisition condition, the limits of frequency range and roughness parameters range (\u03be, H) of the measurable roughness are stored (Figure 2). These condition tables are very useful for assisting metrology specialists in choosing the most suitable acquisition conditions for the CD-SEM, if prior knowledge about the expected roughness is available, or in accounting for the validity domain of the roughness measurement. As a final step, the proposed method is applied to experimental data \u2013 an example of observed PSD over an experimental SEM image is shown in Figure 3. The experimental dataset is composed of SEM images acquired under different conditions (notably a large variation in landing energy \u2013 300eV to 4000eV), and different sample materials (post-etch and post-litho samples). The obtained results confirmed the applicability of the proposed method in a real environment, and will be fully demonstrated in the final work.", "Over the past few years, noise2noise, noise2void, noise2self, and unsupervised deep-learning (DL) denoising techniques have achieved great success, particularly in scenarios where ground truth data is not available or is difficult to obtain. For semiconductor SEM images, ground truth or clean target images with lower noise levels can be obtained by averaging hundreds of frames at the same wafer location, but it is expensive and can result in physical damage to the wafer. This paper\u2019s scope is to denoise SEM images without clean target images and with limited image counts. Inspired by noise2noise, we proposed an additive noise algorithm and DL U-net. We achieved good denoising performance using a limited number of noisy SEM images, without the clean ground truth images. We proposed the \u201cdenoise2next\u201d and \u201cdenoise2best\u201d. We compared generative adversarial network(GAN) generated images and Additive noise images for data augmentation. This paper further quantified the impact of image noise level, pattern diversity, and continuous (aka transfer) learning. The data sets used in the work include both line/space and logic pattern.", "Background: Random and systematic errors found in CD-SEM tools affect the measurement of roughness in dramatically different ways than the measurement of the average critical dimension. Aim: In order to increase the accuracy of roughness measurements, monitor the health of CD-SEM tools, and improve CD-SEM tool matching, it is important to measure and remove the impact of random and systematic errors from the measurements. Approach: Several different CD-SEM tool systematic errors have been identified, but the scan error signature in particular was found to be very relevant. This signature is measured using the mean contour of many properly sampled features and can be used as the target edge for roughness calculations in order to remove this error. Results: Using six different CD-SEM tools and a large data set of across-wafer, across-scanner-field measurements of the same wafer, each CD-SEM tool was found to have a unique CD-SEM signature. Subtracting off this error signature significantly improved the accuracy of the roughness measurements and the CD-SEM tool-to-tool matching. It also identified one tool as being problematic, requiring further attention. Conclusions: Measurement and characterization of the CD-SEM scan error is a powerful tool, along with measurement and removal of random edge detection noise, for monitoring CD-SEM tool health, matching different CD-SEM tools, and improving the accuracy of line-edge and linewidth roughness measurements.", "In this paper, we focus on the across-edges pixelization effects on LER measurement accuracy. The pixelization across edges rounds the detected edge position according to pixel size and is expected to impact the accuracy of LER measurements (rms, correlation length, PSD curve). Given the similar size of targeted LER values in IRDS and of the pixel size used in SEM measurements, these effects are expected to gain an increasing interest and therefore to be worth studying. Our investigation is utilized with the aid of synthesized images (characterized by complete control of roughness and image parameters), with the final aim being the exploration of the link between the selected pixel size of the SEM image and the observed deviation of the measured rms (rms_m) from the true rms value (rms_t). More specifically, the goal is to find the role of the ratio of pixel size to rms_t in the measurement of rms and how we can predict it.", "Overlay (OVL) has become a critical process control and metrology challenge for current and future process nodes of logic as well as memory devices. Especially with the advent of EUV lithography and the accompanying use of two lithographical techniques (EUV and 193nm immersion) for patterning of critical layers, there is an increased need for identifying variability and its root cause in the overlay signatures. Current variability analysis uses pre-defined models mostly related to describe variability and allocating them in standard categories. These models are usually tied to the applicable exposure capabilities. As the EUV to immersion layers undergo exposure with vastly different conditions, there is a need to analyze OVL without associating to specific models. In this paper, we report on a novel model-less method for analyzing overlay data containing complex intra-field signatures. The method can identify and quantify intra-field signatures variation within a wafer as well as across wafers. These signatures enable root cause analysis of contributors to overlay variability. We applied the method on data sets of long-term overlay data of an EUV to a 193-immersion layer. While, several applications of the method with respect to identifying exposure conditions are demonstrated specific to the EUV to immersion layer, it should be noted that the method is universally applicable to any imaging wavelength for current and reference layer.", "Advancing technology nodes in DRAM continues to drive the reduction of on-product overlay (OV) budget. This gives rise to the need for OV metrology with greater accuracy. However, the ever increasing process complexity brings additional challenges related to metrology target deformation, which could contribute to a metrology error. Typically, an accurate OV measurement involves several engineering cycles for target and recipe optimization. In particular, process optimization in either technology development (TD) phase or high volume manufacturing (HVM) phase might influence metrology performance, which requires re-optimization. Therefore, a comprehensive solution providing accuracy and process robustness hereby minimizing the cycle time is highly desirable. In this work, we report multi-wavelength \u03bcDBO enhanced with accuracy aware pixel selection as a solution for robust OV measurement against process changes as well as improved accuracy in HVM. Accuracy aware pixel selection is capable of tackling intra-target processing variations and is established on a multi-wavelength algorithm with immunity to target asymmetry impact. DRAM use cases in FEOL critical layers will be discussed in this paper. Superior robustness and accuracy will be demonstrated together with improved on-product OV performance, promising a process of record metrology solution in specific applications throughout the TD and HVM.", "Further application of machine learning is important for the future development of semiconductor fabrication. Machine learning relies on access to large, detailed datasets. When different parts of the data are owned by different companies who do not wish to pool their data due to commercial sensitivity concerns, the benefits of machine learning can be limited resulting in reduced manufacturing performance. Imec has developed Privacy-preserving Amalgamated Machine Learning (PAML) to overcome this problem and achieve predictive performance close to models built on pooled data, without compromising sensitive raw data. In this paper we give a concrete example based on an in-house overlay metrology dataset where we apply a PAML enhanced version of a tree regression model, and quantify the performance benefit compared to separate models that don\u2019t have access to all of the data.", "With continued innovation of semiconductor processes, overlay control has become the most critical and challenging part. Advanced technology nodes require even tighter lithography overlay control, and therefore, high-order process corrections for inter-field (HOPC) and for intra-field (iHOPC) are adopted as a common solution to meet on-product overlay (OPO) specifications. High order corrections often require more measurement shots and more targets in field, which makes optical overlay metrology on scribe line targets the workhorse of overlay control due to its high throughput and low cost-of-ownership. This leads to the additional challenge that the measurement location also affects the accuracy of generated overlay corrections. For example, it is well known that there may be a spatially dependent offset between overlay on targets and the device. This is commonly called a non-zero offset (NZO) [1], which is a comparison between device overlay measured with the CD SEM after etching (AEI) and optical overlay measured on targets after litho (ADI). In addition, the position of targets could impact the validity of corrections modeled using these targets. The targets could be unevenly distributed in field, some targets huddle at an area, while not a single target appears at others. Hence, this kind of target layout has risks generating problematic field corrections at areas without enough targets. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method utilizing CDSEM overlay to fill in the position where optical overlay targets are deficient. With iHOPC model terms generated by optical overlay targets only, CDSEM metrology results from real devices reveal significantly larger overlay in areas with no targets. By means of this method, the mis-correction at locations where optical overlay targets are deficient is significantly restored, and consequently the OPO mean+3sigma is suppressed to <4nm. Furthermore, an inline control solution is proposed and implemented with the latest generation 5D Analyzer.", "Stitching process is a widely adopted technique in manufacturing of image sensors to overcome reticle size limitations. In order to accomplish successful stitching, both standard overlay target data and stitching data from stitching marks need to be monitored and controlled. Large overlay will result in faulty electric connections between layers, and therefore result in chip failure. Similarly, large stitching also could cause the poor contact between neighboring sub-chips, and consequently result in device malfunction. In this article, we propose three novel methods to enable the correction per exposure (CPE) model for stitching and overlay control. With the implementation of these methods, the stitching and overlay residual are significantly improved compared with current solutions.", "An innovative self-interferometric pupil ellipsometry (SIPE) technique has been demonstrated to overcome the accuracy and throughput limitations raised from the conventional spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) tools to precisely measure the optical critical dimensions (OCD) in the advanced semiconductor devices. The proposed SIPE technique will be extremely powerful, because key ellipsometric parameters, \u03a8 and \u0394, from all possible incident angles can be obtained simultaneously from the single measurement, while the conventional SE technique needs to collect several hundreds of measurements to get the identical information. By employing a Nomarski prism, one can angularly separate the reflected light from the wafer into two orthogonally polarized lights. Then, the self-interference pupil ellipsometer could interfere those two beams without an additional reference beam path. The interfered fringe includes rich ellipsometric information at incident angles from -70\u00ba to 70\u00ba with 0-360\u00ba azimuthal directions, where those \u03a8 and \u0394 information can be extracted by the novel holographic algorithm we proposed. To verify the usefulness of SIPE system and the algorithms, both experimental and theoretical validation have been performed for the patterned wafers. In short, the proposed system and algorithms, which are completely new concept, show a capability to overcome current metrology challenges by breaking multiple parameter correlations between various structural parameters, eventually resulting in the improved metrology sensitivity and precision. Based on the results presented here, we strongly believe the SIPE is a promising metrology solution that can be eventually replacing the traditional OCD tools.", "The continued extensibility of optical critical dimension (OCD) metrology relies not only upon experimental advances but also upon improved, rigorous data analysis. While often approached using traditional non-linear regression (NLR), the inverse problem inherent to OCD metrology can also be addressed using machine learning (ML) techniques. In our recent comparison between two ML approaches, Gaussian process regression (GPR) and NLR enhanced with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation, these methods could yield similar parametric values for a sufficient number of training points, but the GPR yielded much larger uncertainties. Here, we refine and explore further GPR through the addition and explanation of additional parameters, often better capturing crucial physical considerations. By identifying these key fitting attributes, reductions in both parametric uncertainties and in parametric bias are realized. Industrial applicability of GPR and similar ML approaches is discussed with respect to its computational costs.", "Conventional semiconductor etching process control has been performed by separated steps: process, metrology, and feedback control. Uniformity of structures such as Critical Dimension (CD) is an important factor in determining completeness of etching process. To achieve better uniformity, several feedback control has been performed. However, it is difficult to give feedback to the process after metrology due to the lack of process knowledge. In this study, we propose a machine learning technique that can create process control commands from the measured structure using a miniaturized Integrated Metrology (IM) of Spectroscopic Ellipsometery (SE) form. And it is possible to learn the physical analysis through machine learning without introducing a physical analysis method. The proposed analysis consists of two machine learning part: the first neural network for CD metrology, and second network for command generation. The first neural network takes a spectrum sampled at 2048 wavelengths obtained from IM as an input, and outputs CDs of structures. Finally, the second artificial neural network takes a changes of temperatures in a wafer and outputs the control commands of powers. As a result, we have improved the CD range of poly mask in a wafer from 1.69 nm to 1.36 nm.", "The authors present latent image characterization in photoresists by means of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectroscopic reflectometry. The optical constants of photoresists before and after exposure are measured in the EUV spectral range. Latent images are investigated in the form of periodic line gratings. The investigation is performed by the analysis of spectroscopic reflectance curves in the wavelength range from 5 nm to 20 nm at grazing incidence angles. Through an analysis of the reflectance curves based on rigorous electromagnetic modeling, a characterization of parameters of interest of the latent image is evaluated. This includes the latent image profile, surface topography and stochastic-related parameters such as line edge roughness.", "The Semiconductor industry relies on the metrology to keep up with a highly competitive production environment and technology ramp up. To reduce metrology costs without degrading quality we propose to use sensors data such as scanner leveling data as a new way to detect maverick lots and wafers enabling a smarter measurement sampling scheme. To achieve this, data preparation and data cleaning with Zernike polynomials method is required. Then the pre-processed data are used to feed an unsupervised density based machine learning algorithm (DBSCAN) that can detect outliers as an human expert would. Finally, a solution (Random Forest Discriminant Analysis) for root cause detection of abnormal fingerprints is tested in this paper. A method working on other use cases (Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis) is also used for result crossing.", "A novel mid-infrared critical dimension (IRCD) metrology has been developed on a platform suitable for fab production. Compared to traditional optical critical dimension (OCD) technology based on ultraviolet, visible, and near-IR light, the IRCD system exploits unique optical properties of common semiconductor fab materials in the mid-infrared to enable accurate measurements of high-aspect-ratio etched features. In this paper, we will show two examples of critical dry etch steps in 3D NAND channel formation module of an advanced node that require nondestructive process control: (1) channel hole active area etch and (2) amorphous carbon hardmask etch. In the first example, we take advantage of the absorption bands of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride to get accurate CD measurements at different depths, resulting in high-fidelity z-profile metrology of the channel \u2013 key to guiding process development and accelerated learning for 3D NAND device manufacturing. In the second example, the most common amorphous carbon hardmask materials for advanced 3D NAND nodes are opaque in the traditional OCD wavelength range; however, in the mid-infrared, there is light penetration and hence spectral sensitivity to dimensional parameters including sub-surface features. We show successful detection of intentional process skews and as well accurate bottom CD measurements of the hardmask.", "With the aggressive scaling of semiconductor devices, the increasing complexity of device structure coupled with tighter metrology error budget has driven up Optical Critical Dimension (OCD) time to solution to a critical point. Machine Learning (ML), thanks to its extremely fast turnaround, has been successfully applied in OCD metrology as an alternative solution to the conventional physical modeling. However, expensive and limited reference data or labeled data set necessary for ML to learn from often leads to under- or overlearning, limiting its wide adoption. In this paper, we explore techniques that utilize process information to supplement reference data and synergizing physical modeling with ML to prevent under- or overlearning. These techniques have been demonstrated to help overcome the constraint of limited reference data with use cases in challenging OCD metrology for advanced semiconductor nodes.", "Nanosheet Field-Effect Transistors (FETs) are candidates to replace today\u2019s finFETs as they offer both an enhanced electrostatic control and a reduced footprint. The processing of these devices involves the selective lateral etching, also called cavity etch, of the SiGe layers of a vertical Si/SiGe superlattice, to isolate the future vertically stacked Si channels. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of various conventional Critical Dimension (CD) and alternative spectroscopic techniques for this challenging measurement of a buried CD. We conclude that Raman and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopies are very promising techniques for fast inline cavity depth measurements.", "Over the past several years, stacked Nanosheet Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors captured the focus of the semiconductor industry and has been identified as the new lead architecture to continue LOGIC CMOS scaling beyond-5nm node. The fabrication of GAA devices requires new specific integration modules. From very early processing points, these structures require complex metrology to fully characterize the three-dimensional parameter set. As the technology continues through research and development cycles and looks to transition to manufacturing, there are many opportunities and challenges remaining for inline metrology. Especially valuable are measurement techniques which are non-destructive, fast, and provide multi-dimensional feedback, where reducing dependencies on offline techniques has a direct impact to the frequency of cycles of learning. More than previous nodes, then, this node may be when some of these offline techniques jump from the lab to the fab, as certain critical measurements need to be monitored realtime. Thanks to the compute revolution this very industry enabled, machine learning has begun to permeate inline disposition, and hybrid metrology systems continue to advance. Metrology solutions and methodologies developed for prior technologies will also still have a large role in the characterization of these structures, as effects such as line edge roughness (LER), pitchwalk, and defectivity continue to be managed. This paper reviews related prior studies and advocates for future metrology development that ensures nanosheet technology has the inline data necessary for success.", "Here, we report the measurement of the dielectric spacer etch process for nanowire and nanosheet FET processes. A previously described Nanowire Test Structure (NWTS) was used for this study.[1, 2, 3] This structure has alternating Si/Si1-xGex/\u2026/Si multilayers. Subsequent to the selective etching of the Si1-xGex layers (cavity etch), a silicon nitride (SiN) dielectric layer was deposited on the NWTS. Here we report on the use of Mueller Matrix Spectroscopic Ellipsometry based Scatterometry (MMSE) to measure the thickness of the SiN dielectric layer after deposition and after trim etch steps. Four different amounts of trim etch were characterized.", "In-line Raman spectroscopy for compositional and strain metrology throughout front-end-of-line manufacturing of next generation stacked gate-all-around nanosheet field-effect transistors is presented. Thin and alternating layers of fully strained pseudomorphic Si(1-x)Gex and Si were grown epitaxially on a Si substrate and subsequently patterned. Intentional strain variations were introduced by changing the Ge content (x = 0.25, 0,35, 0.50). Polarization-dependent in-line Raman spectroscopy was employed to characterize and quantify the strain evolution of Si and Si(1-x)Gex nanosheets throughout front-end-of-line processing by focusing on the analysis of Si-Si and Si-Ge optical phonon modes. To evaluate the accuracy of the Raman metrology results, strain reference data were acquired by non-destructive high-resolution x-ray diffraction and from destructive lattice deformation maps using precession electron diffraction. It was found that the germanium-alloy composition as well as Si and Si(1-x)Gex strain obtained by Raman spectroscopy are in excellent agreement with reference metrology and follow trends of previously published simulations.", "In this work, the novel enhancement to multichannel scatterometry data collection, Spectral Interferometry, is introduced and discussed. The Spectral Interferometry technology adds unique spectroscopic data by providing absolute phase information. This enhances metrology performance by improving sensitivity to weak target parameters and reducing parameter correlations. Spectral Interferometry enhanced OCD capabilities were demonstrated for one of the most critical and challenging applications of gate-all-around nanosheet device manufacturing: lateral etching of SiGe nanosheet layers to form inner spacer indentations. The inner spacer protects the channel from the source/drain regions during channel release and defines the gate length of the device. Additionally, a methodology is presented, which enables reliable and reproducible manufacturing of reference samples with engineered sheet-specific indent variations at nominal etch processing. Such samples are ideal candidates for evaluating metrology solutions with minimal destructive reference metrology costs. Two strategies, single parameter and sheet-specific indent monitoring are discussed, and it was found that the addition of spectroscopic information acquired by Spectral Interferometry improved both optical metrology solutions. In addition to improving the match to references for single parameter indent monitoring, excellent sheet-specific indent results can be delivered", "In this paper, budget characterization and wafer mapping of the Edge Placement Error (EPE) is studied to manage and improve pattern defects with a use case selected from SK Hynix\u2019s most advanced DRAM 1x nm product. To quantify EPE, CD and overlay were measured at the multiple process steps and then combined for the EPE reconstruction. Massive metrology was used to capture extreme statistics and fingerprint across the wafer. An EPE budget breakdown was performed to identify main contributors and their variations. The end result shows EPEmax is mostly driven by local CD and overlay components while EPE variation is dominated by overlay and global CD components. Beyond EPE budget, a novel EPE wafer mapping methodology is introduced to visualize the temporal and spatial EPE performance which captures variation not seen from CD and overlay. This enables root-cause analysis of the pattern defects, and provides a foundation towards a better process monitoring solution. For EPE improvement, serial CD and overlay optimization simulation was performed to verify opportunities for reduction of the EPE and variation using the available ASML applications. The potential improvement for this use-case was confirmed to be 4.5% compared to baseline performance.", "The precise metrology for edge placement error (EPE) is required especially in EUV era. Last year, we proposed new contour extraction algorithm using machine learning and verified the robustness to SEM noise on AEI pattern. In this study, we suggest the method for contour extraction on ADI pattern and improve the EPE measurement accuracy. It is known that the gray-level signal profile across the pattern edge on SEM image is varied depending on e-beam scan direction angle to the pattern edge, and especially the contrast of parallel pattern edge to scan direction is low and unstable. In addition, in case of ADI, the gray-level of SEM image are varied and have the shading because of charge effect caused by e-beam exposure on the pattern. Therefore, the contour extraction on ADI pattern just using simple feature value or some of thresholds is usually inaccurate. However, the precise contour extraction independent on e-beam scan direction is required strongly for 2D pattern inspection and metrology. In this paper, we will propose the novel contour extraction method of precise EPE metrology on ADI regardless of the ebeam scanning direction to the pattern edge. We use machine learning to extract contour, splitted training data according to target edge direction, and trained contour extraction model. This model is expected to learn not only the gray-level variation but also the drift of landing position caused by the charge effect on ADI. We captured SEM images on the ADI wafer with several scan direction and compared between the contours extracted by the conventional method and extracted by the proposal method, then the improvement of EPE measurement accuracy at every pattern direction on ADI is verified.", "As technology progress with scaling to meet the market requirements, the patterning characterization of dense features suffers a significant challenge for current optic tools, and measurement accuracy will be an important index and great challenge as well. Patterning can mostly be characterized with index of overlay (OVL) and CDU (critical dimension uniformity) measurement. When you break down the budget of the overlay error, one of the challenges is a gap of measurement results between scribe and device, where provides improper information to be used in overlay correction and causes process anomaly (excursion) detection, resulting in a low yield at the end of the production process. An eBeam tool, using high electron landing energies while utilizing the ElluminatorTM technology[1] for improvement backscattered electrons (BSE) imaging efficiency, can be utilized to directly capture OVL performance of device unit in-die, including local and global level, due to BSE function of eBeam tool[2]. In this paper, we demonstrate overlay measurement of M0 to Poly line in device for advanced logic node (only OVL X measurement), obtaining Overlay gap between in-die and scribe line to capture the actual behavior of device unit in-die. Massive OVL data is measured using eBeam tool with fast speed and high resolution, and local OVL results have been analyzed in detail. We\u2019ve quantified what is the impact of overlay correction by different measurement ways whether it depends on optical tool or eBeam tool and benefits yield improvement.", "Edge placement error (EPE) analysis, which combines pattern variation data from single litho-process steps with overlay data from subsequent litho-process steps, has been well established as a key methodology to characterize the performance of complex semiconductor manufacturing processes. As critical dimensions shrink in new semiconductor technologies, process margins become tighter, and characterizing and monitoring EPE budgets becomes more important than ever to assess and maintain in-line process performance and yield. In this paper, we present SEM image contour-based EPE analysis and budget generation for a BEOL multi-patterning (LELE) layer. SEM contour analysis was previously shown to be a suitable method for pattern variability characterization, with the capability to capture not only pattern size, but also shape and local stochastic placement variations, and to provide statistical overlay margin estimates between separate device layers. In the current work, we also show that for a LELE process, contour analysis provides local overlay measurements and all inputs needed to generate the complete EPE budget breakdown. Multiple wafers from a device in production were provided after processing the second etch step of a metal layer LELE process. We acquire large field-of-view SEM images with a high-throughput e-beam tool (HMI eP5), sampled within die, across exposure field and across wafer in order to enable analysis of variability into global and local components. Pattern contours are extracted from individual SEM images, and contours are \u2018stacked\u2019 to identify specific locations of largest variability or smallest margin. While the images contain patterns from both processing steps, these can be uniquely distinguished after die-to-database alignment and labeled by mask ID, here 1st and 2nd litho-etch layers, respectively. In addition to size, shape and stochastic placement variations, we perform center-of-gravity analysis between patterns on the 1st and 2nd litho-etch layers. The latter reveals local on-device overlay variations that can be mapped across the measured wafers. The contour analysis therefore provides all information required for a thorough EPE budget breakdown, i.e. global CDU and local CDU for the most critical cutline locations, as well as overlay. Figure 1 shows the breakdown for one particular point of interest. We perform EPE budget analysis for multiple wafers, which can highlight wafer-to-wafer variations. This is a first step toward process monitoring, which would not only highlight process drifts, but also distinguish main contributors in order to aid in trouble shooting.

Along with this design rule shrink, the patterning control with the metric of Edge Placement Error (EPE), of which main contributors are CD and overlay error, becomes more and more critical. EPE-aware process margin studies1 are of growing interest and focus on advanced nodes. However, the studies are mostly focused on single type of device feature or hot spot (HS) and the EPE budget breakdown is analyzed through the data set from different process steps, metrology tools (SEM, OM), and measurement targets (device structure, scribe line target) which inherently contains the problem of data integrity and proximity2. Due to the complicated and localized process loading of the various pattern on logic device the EPE analysis is required on diverse critical device features (HS\u2019s) which shows different fingerprint of EPE due to the process loadings and multi-patterning effects among unit process characteristics. To accomplish this multiple HS EPE-aware analysis, the measurement must be taken at various real device pattern. This requirement leads to data collection with an e-beam tool, using high electron landing energies while utilizing the ElluminatorTM technology for improvement backscattered electrons (BSE) imaging efficiency. This is the unique and right approach to directly capture CD and overlay simultaneously in die, on device, multiple HS\u2019s in local and global level. In this paper, we will demonstrate the EPE budget analysis on various on device HS which results in the different process fingerprint due to the local process loading effect. The all-in-one and on device pattern measurement is the essential prerequisite capability on this study. The data is captured from the high-quality e-beam image which delivers a CD-SEM comparable precision, low TMU overlay metrology on real device. We demonstrate that with the multi HS EPE-aware analysis from the all-in-one on device data, the balanced EPE margin is achieved through the co-optimized correctable with the weighted factors among HS\u2019s to increase yield at end of line.

We will discuss EPE budget and compare intra-field, inter-field and local variations. In particular, it will be shown how the interaction of remaining systematic intra- and inter-field errors can create local EPE hotspots that are prone to result in patterning failures. By convoluting these systematic EPE errors with random across wafer and local EPE errors, we will predict patterning failure maps across wafer, where the EPE hotspots manifest in local failures and thus yield stripes. Finally we will discuss how the reduction of intra-field overlay and CDU by using ForTune mask tuning is able to dramatically reduce the EPE hotspots and thus helps to prevent pattering failure and yield striping.

SPIE. 11148, Photomask Technology 2019", "Driven by the increasing demand for a better on-product overlay control, the metrology specifications continue to tighten when nodes advance. Metrology accuracy budgets are reaching levels close to 1 angstrom. To obey these stringent requirements on metrology accuracy, the understanding of the interplay between the metrology target and metrology tool is of paramount importance to advance diffraction based overlay (DBO) to the next level of accuracy. In this contribution we will first present a model for the signal formation of DBO. We will show how overlay is translated into a measurable intensity asymmetry using biased gratings. When the metrology target is symmetric, the accuracy of the measurement is limited by photon shot noise only. We will show how an asymmetric target deformation leads to an overlay ambiguity that deteriorates the accuracy of the overlay metrology well beyond the fundamental photon shot noise limit. To recover from the effects of asymmetric target deformation, we will show that additional information is needed on top of the traditional single wavelength overlay reading on one target. When the target deformation is small, that additional information can, for example, come from multiple wavelengths. For large asymmetric target deformations causing a significant center-of-gravity shift, a plurality of targets or a description of the stack is needed. These specific solution directions will be discussed in detail. In conclusion, in this paper we will dive into the fundamentals of diffraction based overlay, where we explore the physics of the signal formation in diffraction based overlay in the presence of asymmetric target deformation. We will show that a better understanding of the signal formation helps to develop methods that advance diffraction based overlay metrology to the next level of accuracy, which is needed to fulfill the increasing demand for a better on product overlay control.", "This paper presents a new overlay metrology target design and scheme referred as Moir\u00e9OVLTM. It utilizes Moir\u00e9 patterns of two overlapping gratings to amplify the kernel response to overlay misalignment and thereby has the potential to enhance kernel sensitivity, detectability and measurement accuracy. A Self-referenced (SR) Moir\u00e9OVL design scheme, which enables Moir\u00e9OVL to be measured with existing image-based overlay tools is proposed and evaluated on a contact layer. This paper demonstrated the feasibility of SR-Moir\u00e9OVL on existing IBO tools. When comparing to the reference SEM-based overlay, a magnification factor of 6.9X with an R2 of 0.96 and a calibrated intercept of 0.34nm was observed on wafer. Comparison between Moir\u00e9OVL and POR IBO on TIS, residuals, precision and TMU is presented.

First, we evaluated full response surfaces for each combination of the discrete equipment settings and calculated desirability scores using a normalization function. Second, we combined gradient optimization techniques and response surface methodologies to find the important local maxima (center of the islands in quadratic contour) and stationary response points. Once all the stationary response points have been identified, users can choose to rank the solutions by quality or can choose to use analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods to determine which main effects and/or interactions are of interest. Two separate layers were evaluated and compared to the process of reference (POR) brute force method of optimization. Results showed that the best residuals values from recipes optimized using 1-cycle SPOC-based automatic recipe optimization (ARO) and ARO based on the 2- cycle Brute-Force strategy were comparable to known residuals values from the POR recipes. Moreover, SPOC-based ARO was performed with a TTR of under 2 hours, while a 2-cycle Brute-Force ARO typically took 6~ 20 hours depending on specific configurations. The vast reduction in optimization time is primarily attributed to the elimination of multi-cycle refinement, whose data collection dominated the previously observed TTR. In conclusion, we demonstrated the ability to reduce time to solution by a factor of 3 while maintaining or improving on overlay residuals compared to existing brute force methodologies.", "A new algorithm called Single Wavelength Overlay Optimizer (SWOOP) enhances the performance of single-wavelength optical diffraction-based overlay metrology. SWOOP combines statistical learning with a physical model to advance the performance of single-wavelength measurements to that of multi-wavelength measurements. This is achieved by making a set of multi-wavelength measurements on the first wafer during a train phase and extracting the characteristic signature of the overlay inaccuracy at the pupil plane. This inaccuracy signature is then evaluated and removed in real time for single-wavelength measurements, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness to process variation without compromising throughput.", "As design nodes of advanced semiconductor chips shrink, reduction in on-product overlay (OPO) budget becomes more critical to achieving higher yield. Imaging-based overlay (IBO) targets usually consist of periodic patterns where their pitches are resolvable with visible light microscopy. The difference between the feature dimensions of the device and the optical target is growing as device design nodes shrink. To make the optical target emulate the device as much as possible, the target\u2019s feature periodicity is reduced. Using this approach, the process impact on the device is simulated on the overlay target which enables a more accurate measurement on grid (target) in terms of OPO matching. To further optimize IBO performance, a new moir\u00e9 effect based robust Advanced Imaging Mode (rAIM\u2122) target design was developed. This rAIM IBO target is implemented using significantly smaller pitches compared to the standard AIM\u00ae target, resulting in a more device-like target design. In this paper we investigate the benefits of the optical improvement, manifested as the target gain, and the process compatibility benefits to improve the target accuracy, robustness, and measurability to meet overlay (OVL) basic performance requirements, such as total measurement uncertainty (TMU).", "The current state of the art ADI overlay metrology relies on multi-wavelength uDBO techniques. Combining the wavelengths results in better robustness against process effects like process induced grating asymmetries. Overlay information is extracted in the image plane by determining the intensity asymmetry in the 1st order diffraction signals of two grating pairs with an intentional shift (bias). In this paper we discuss a next evolution in DBO targets where a target is created with multiple biases. These so called cDBO (continuous bias DBO) targets have a slightly different pitch between top and bottom grating, which has the effect of having a different bias values along the grating length and are complimentary to the uDBO technology. Where for the uDBO target, the diffraction results in a uniform Intensity pattern that carries the Overlay signal, for cDBO, an oscillating intensity pattern occurs, and the Overlay information is now captured in the phase of that pattern. Phase-based Overlay has an improved, intrinsic robustness over intensity-based overlay and can reduce the need for multi-wavelength techniques in several cases. Results on memory technology wafers confirm that the swing-curve (through-wavelength) behavior is indeed more stable for phase-based DBO target and that for accurate Overlay, this target can be qualified with a single wavelength recipe (compared to the uDBO dual wavelength recipe). In this paper, both initial results on a Micron feasibility wafer will be shown as well as demonstrated capability in a production environment.", "Things are drastically changing in the field of metrology. The main reason for that is related to the daunting specification requirements for metrology imposed by high Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (high NA EUVL). We observe a variety of new generation e-beam tools proliferating in imec unique ecosystem, from in-line Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) to Voltage Contrast (VC) overlay tools, from Die To Database (D2DB) large area Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to high-voltage SEM, from Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based inspection tools to massive data acquisition e-beam system. We are facing a renaissance of e-beam metrology. In this paper, we are going to describe the challenges as well as the latest evolutionary developments of e-beam metrology in the semiconductor industry.", "As we strive toward smaller and smaller pitches to enable device scaling, thorough defect characterization at wafer scale continues its importance during the early phases of process optimization. In this paper, we describe experiments and show characterization results for capturing stochastic defects across various test structures of 28 nm pitch devices that have been patterned using single exposure EUV lithography. The objective of this work is to quantify detection sensitivity of critical defect types on multiple test structures, and study wafer and die level signatures for some of the types. We will employ various, complementary optical and e-beam inspection and review techniques. Further, new methods to increase sensitivity of optical inspection after litho are also discussed.", "In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography process, stochastic defects are randomly generated and can have a significant impact on the yield of high-volume manufacturing (HVM) when printed even at an extremely low probability down to parts per trillion (ppt) level. In this field, electron beam inspection (EBI) tools are regarded as a promising option to detect killer defects with enough capture rate. However, EBI requires a longer inspection time and it is pointed out as the current limitation of EBI. To overcome this limitation, throughput optimization and data collection strategy must be prepared to push the bounds of EBI capability. In this paper, we study the probability of EUV stochastic defect and its statistical signature in massive data using EBI. Tool performance for detecting defects is maximized by investigating the impact of different parameters of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on throughput and defect capture rate. After performance verification, we demonstrate massive metrology and inspection performance of Die to Database Edge Placement Error (D2DB EPE) to extend the prediction range of stochastic defect probability down to the order of 1 defect/mm2. The method is applied to EBI results on EUV processed pitch 32nm line and space (L/S) pattern to prove the necessity of massive e-beam data analysis of low-level defectivity and intra-field variation.", "To keep up with logic area scaling, BEOL dimensions have been reduced at an accelerated pace, leading to ever smaller metal pitches and reduced cross-sectional areas of the wires. As a result, routing congestion and a dramatic RC delay (resulting from an increased resistance-capacitance (RC) product) have become important bottlenecks for further interconnect scaling, driving the need for introducing new materials and integration schemes in the BEOL. The current paper studies the damascene process flow that uses a single exposure EUV to create metal lines and 2D patterns at metal half-pitch of 14nm, corresponding to the imec N5 node for logic BEOL layer. A bright field mask with a negative tone resist process was used to develop trenches and transfer these patterns into an oxide dielectric layer. Following this, the trenches were filled with ruthenium (Ru) for electrically testing. Test vehicle included multiple structures, including E-test resistance and capacitance structures, to allow a comprehensive study of the proposed process flow. Metrology requirements and performance at various process steps will be discussed in this paper. Our focus will be on the scatterometry methods that together with machine learning (ML) allow fast and accurate measurements of multiple parameters of interest at large sampling. In the current paper, we present results for inline measurements of line and space critical dimensions (CD), line edge roughness (LER) \u2013 after patterning and after hard mask etch, and the prediction of the electrical performance of the metal lines after Ru CMP. In addition, scatterometry ML capabilities for inline tip-to- tip (T2T) measurements are successfully demonstrated.", "For advanced DRAM nodes, process window requirements have become extremely tight for Critical Dimension (CD) and Overlay. Determining process window based only on mean CD without quantifying defectivity on the wafer is no longer adequate. A superior approach illustrated in this paper is to generate pattern specific stochastic failure rate (FR) models that capture the non-normal nature of the fail rate distribution, using large numbers of measurements on focus-exposure-matrix (FEM) wafers. This model can be used to predict the FR contours to the part-per-billion (ppb) rate or more. The defectivity process window of course corresponds to the FR contour that meets the process FR requirement. Patterns can be grouped based on their characteristics into a single model, but generally multiple models must be generated to cover the range of printed geometries. This modeling methodology was applied to the periphery support circuitry for a DRAM technology currently in development. The particular layer involved bidirectional line/space pattern printed using DUV. Models were built and defectivity contour plots were generated for ten different patterns. Their contours at the target FR were compared with the purpose of determining if any posed a concern for high-volume manufacturing. Actually inspecting these patterns and directly measuring the FR to the PPB was impossible for two reasons: 1) The inspection time would be prohibitive 2) There are not enough replicates on the wafer to do this. To evaluate the accuracy of the final stochastic aware process windows, the FR on select patterns was directly measured and showed good agreement. This information can be used as a basis for modifying the OPC model or even the periphery design for problematic patterns. Overall this methodology provides a very efficient way to tune in patterning to meet HVM requirements.", "Over the years, the reduction in the size of semiconductor devices has made their performances extremely sensitive to small differences between printed structures and intended design. As a consequence, metrology equipment manufacturers are nowadays proposing new tool configurations, able to ensure quality control in such a challenging environment by generating massive multi-properties measurement sets from inspected wafers. However, the unprecedented amount of acquired measurements and their intrinsic diversity creates a new challenge in terms of data analysis. In this work, we propose an analysis method suitable for massive multi-descriptors data sets and apply it to the processing of measurements acquired on the GS1000, the latest generation e-beam metrology tool from Hitachi. This new approach is based on the Parallel Coordinates Plot (PCP). The PCP representation is very efficient to condensate multidimensional data into a single plot, but not adapted to large data sets due to over-plotting problems. To overcome these issues, we have developed specific strategies to enable PCP to be efficient on massive data analysis by both extracting neighbors' properties by median depiction and the multi-properties dispersion. The experimental validation has been carried out over 1.7 billion Contact Hole (CH) measurements acquired on a test wafer. 28 different properties have been quantified from the e-beam images for each pattern and grouped into 3 categories: size area, edge placement error, and gap. The analysis of the full data set with the proposed methodology clearly showed the FEM fingerprint and allowed us to determine the process window based on the multi-criteria analysis. By combining the PCP with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) we were able to model accurately the stochastic cliffs defects' density.", "In the world of today\u2019s internet of things economy, the number of semiconductor designs is increasing rapidly. A cost effective way is needed to set up new designs for manufacturing. All available data sources need to be utilized to do the setup.

Unique strength over competing metrology techniques includes the potential for undistorted, local high resolution information. Comparatively slow throughput has traditionally limited high volume manufacturing (HVM) deployment. Here, we discuss the advantages of a multi-head AFM system with miniaturized high-speed SPMs working in parallel. In addition, we extend traditional AFM techniques to selective imaging and metrology of subsurface 3D structures and show a path to enabling Overlay metrology through opaque hard mask layers.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "On Product Overlay (OPO) control is a critical factor in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. As feature sizes become smaller, OPO budgets become tighter, leaving less room for overlay (OVL) measurement inaccuracy. Over the last few years, overlay metrology\u2019s focus has shifted inwards, towards accurate measurement conditions, as we aim to capture ever-smaller process and scanner variations. One method used to break down the OPO error budget is combining one or more accuracy flags and correlating them to various process impacts. Analyzing the overlay accuracy signature generated by accuracy flags can be useful for data validation, inspection and correlation to different processes and metrologies. In this paper, an extensive OVL accuracy experiment demonstrates the use of this new method. First, the method is applied to several wafers designed with intentional process variation, including variations in etch duration, Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) duration, amorphous silicon (a-Si) thickness and titanium nitride (TiN) thickness. OVL results from the experimental wafers are compared with results from the reference (nominal) wafer.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Reduction in on product overlay (OPO) is a key component for high-end, high yield integrated circuit manufacturing. Due to the continually shrinking dimensions of the IC device elements it has become near-impossible to measure overlay on the device itself, driving the need to perform overlay measurements on dedicated overlay targets. In order to enable accurate measurement on grid (target) in terms of OPO matching, the overlay mark must be as similar as possible to the device in order to mimic the process impact on the device. Imaging-based optical overlay (IBO) provides the best accuracy and robustness for overlay metrology measurements for many process layers. To further optimize IBO performance, a new robust AIM (rAIM\u2122) IBO target design was developed, using the Moir\u00e9 effect. rAIM is implemented using significantly smaller pitches compared with the standard AIM\u00ae target, hence providing a more device-like target design.

Moreover, a simulated unit (stack) represented by its optical and geometrical properties can be used as a mathematicalphysical object for obtaining a deeper understanding of the issues faced while an actual measurement performed. Location based stack calibration allows for both, symmetrical and asymmetrical process variation, a noticeable wafer signature to be attained. Using this information, one can analyze the target-design process-compatibility and asymmetry stability. Furthermore, simulated data can be used, combined with measured data, to establish a more exhaustive perceiving of the process characteristics and risks, hence maxims the measurement performances and stability of the process and target behavior. Likewise, simulation tools can equip integration teams with a more holistic apprehension and quantified data, prior or along real time measurements.

We will review the key advantages of dry resist processing over wet resist processing: stability, photo sensitivity, environmental footprint, and cost. This nascent technology has demonstrated best in class resist performance at leading edge design rules, breaks several long standing tradeoffs in EUV photoresist materials, and opens the door to a new world of innovations in EUV lithography patterning.", "As feature sizes continue to shrink, low k1 lithographic processes are required to advance chip technologies.

With these constraints in mind, we have previously explored spin-on selective deposition of polymers over microscale features for ultimate use in ALD technologies. Two methods have previously been explored. The first approach considered a spin-on self-assembled monolayer (SAM) protecting either a metal or dielectric pre-pattern followed by a selective spin-on polymer coating. The second approach customized a synthetic fluorinated polymer tailoring the surface energies to the structures and sizes of interest in order to achieve selective deposition. In this work, pre-patterned copper and dielectric patterns are explored for selective deposition using pitch ranges from 128nm \u2013 1000nm. A combination of spin-on SAMs along with custom synthesized polymers are studied. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are used to characterize final polymer coatings and the impact of polymer structure, solution concentration, and processing conditions will be discussed. Ultimately, it will be shown that the combination of both spin-on SAMs and custom synthesized polymers successfully results in selective deposition over nanometer scale patterns, increasing previous resolution by two orders of magnitude.", "As the next generation of Extreame Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, high-NA EUV is proposed. EUV resist is one of the challenges to achieve it. Non-CAR type hemicellulose resist was proposed last year and improved for high-NA EUV resist. The target is stable and high resolution chain scission resist. It was confirmed that hemicellulose works as a radical source by electron spin resonanse(ESR) analysis and hemicellulose improves EUV sensitivity from 50 to 28 mJ/cm2. The primary advantage of the hemicellulose resist is its excellent wafer transportability. The properties of resist such as low metal contamination, resist film uniformity, and edge cut were confirmed. The optimization of the lithography process improves the resolution of hemicellulose resist and pitch 26 nm L/S pattern was obtained with OPALTM-RH02. Furthermore, hole pattern of pitch 40 nm was also obtained.", "EUV lithography (EUVL) is expected to offer a single-exposure solution down to 5 nm or below nodes. To successfully implement EUVL for sub-10 nm nodes on time, one major hurdle is the availability of compatible resists with sufficiently low line edge/width roughness (LER/LWR) and low exposure dose. Hence, the requirements of high-resolution patterning along with sub 10 nm feature size necessitates nanocluster size resist materials with high irradiation absorption coefficients, considerably high sensitivity, and permissible LER and LWR. To meet the aforementioned requirements, we formulated a negative tone metal-core (indium and copper) organic clusters resists such as In-MOCs and Cu-MOCs having a nanosize domain. In-MOCs is comprised of indium core as an inorganic metal building unit and methacrylic acid (MAA) as an organic ligand while the Cu-MOCs is comprised of copper metal core and trans 2,3 dimethylacrylic acid (DMA) organic ligand through the versatile sol-gel method. The incorporation of indium and copper metal provides the enhanced absorption of irradiation beams, while the MAA and DMA in the formulated resist showing radical polymerization could be easily crosslinked through the carbon-carbon bond with the minimal amount of exposure dose of He+ ions to form a negative tone resist. The designed resists exhibit a significantly higher sensitivity of ~12.76 \u03bcC/cm2 and ~14.93 \u03bcC/cm2 towards the helium ion beam for In-MOCs and Cu-DMA resists, respectively.

The calculated LER and LWR for 13 nm half-pitch patterns are 2.56 \u00b1 0.06 nm and 2.48 \u00b1 0.08 nm, respectively for In-MOCs resist, while the computed line edge roughness (LER), line width roughness (LWR) for HR~10 nm (HP) line patterns are 2.24 \u00b1 0.08 nm and 3.1 \u00b1 0.09 nm, respectively for Cu-DMA resist.", "Polymeric materials have been utilized in semiconductor industries such as pattern formation materials. One of the drawbacks of such polymers is the lack of etch resistance. Metal infiltration into polymer matrices is an emerging technology that could overcome the issue. The gaseous organo-metal precursors penetrate into polymer matrices where they are oxidized to form stable metal oxides. Thus formed organic-inorganic hybrid material shows superior etch-resistance which enables to form patterns with high aspect ratio [1]. One of the most commonly studied processes is the infiltration of trimethylaluminium (TMA) into polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). One of the issues of this technology is that increase in volume of the polymer after the infiltration is inevitable, since metal oxides are added to the polymer. For example, we observed over 10 % of volume expansion for the combination of PMMA and TMA [2]. If this technology was dedicated to small feature sizes, it would be preferable to maintain its original shape. Poly(tert-butylmethacrylate) (PtBuMA) has a similar structure to PMMA except that it has a tert-butyl group on its side-chain instead of a methyl group. This polymer is known to decompose above 180 degree Celsius, releasing the butyl group in form of 2-butene. If the out-going of tert-butyl group and the in-coming of TMA occurs simultaneously under ambient temperature, we can expect to see a balance of volumetric shrinkage and expansion. In this paper, a concept using PtBuMA to compensate the volume increase after metal infiltration is described.", "We have developed an organic-inorganic hybrid resist platform featuring versatile ex-situ control of its performance by incorporating inorganic elements using vapor-phase infiltration (VPI) into standard organic resists.

Building upon the demonstration of PMMA-AlOx hybrid resist, we expanded our material portfolio to a high sensitivity resist and other inorganic moieties. We present preliminary results obtained from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography dose tests conducted on corresponding infiltrated hybrids and optimization of infiltration with the help of transmission electron microscopy (TEM).", "Low-energy electrons are released whenever ionizing high-energy radiation interacts with matter. They drive chemical reactions in the irradiated material, enable state-of-the art nanofabrication technologies such as focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID), and contribute to the reactions of resist materials in extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). This contribution presents fundamental research on the role of low-energy electrons in FEBID and EUVL. We discuss how reactions initiated by low-energy electrons can be exploited in FEBID to obtain metal-containing deposits with optimal purity. Regarding EUVL, the role of low-energy electrons in the conversion of an inorganic resist by EUV absorption has been investigated.", "Catalyst diffusion is a critical component of the pattern formation process in chemically amplified resists (CARs). In this study, we used a concerted experimental and modeling effort to examine diffusion of an inert catalyst analogue (sodium triflate) in a hydroxystyrene-based ESCAP terpolymer resin. First, atomistic simulations at high temperatures reveal an order-of-magnitude enhancement of the Fickian diffusivity in the protected reactant versus the fully deprotected product, while time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements at temperatures near the glass transition show no appreciable differences. The data from simulations and experiments conform to a unified curve, enabling estimates of the Fickian diffusivity at relevant post-exposure bake (PEB) temperatures through extrapolation. Second, acid-catalyzed reaction kinetics were measured with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and compared with reaction-diffusion models based on the estimated Fickian diffusivities. The initial kinetics in experiments is orders-of-magnitude faster than predictions, demonstrating that models of catalyst transport should capture effects beyond Fickian diffusion. Finally, the simulations examined ion-ion and polymer-ion interactions at the atomistic level, features that are difficult to probe by experimental investigations. These data show that ion pair clustering in the protected and deprotected materials is similar as temperature is reduced, and ion pair dynamics in both materials is dominated by interactions with hydroxystyrene repeat units. These trends explain the experimental observations that ion diffusion is similar in the protected and deprotected polymers.", "Although Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) at 13.5 nm wavelength already moved into commercialization state, serious technical issues remain as important challenges.

Furthermore, I would mention about minimum structural unit constructing resist pattern related to resolution limit and LER.", "In the field of semiconductor manufacturing, there is still a continuous search for techniques to improve the Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU) across the wafer. CDU improvement and general defectiveness reduction increase the industrial yield and guarantee high reliability standards. In the KrF Dual-Damascene module integration, at a lithographic level, deep trench planarization is mandatory to minimize interference patterns of the photoresist known as the swing curve effect. Swing curve models explain why small changes in the film thickness of the photosensitive material can create wide critical dimensions changes. Different approaches have been developed to improve the CDU, like the etch-back approach and partial via filling. Within the plethora of materials studied to improve the performances, the Marangoni-effect based underlayers are now showing their potential. In the past, an extensive testing of a double-layer solution comprising one Marangoni-effect-based material and one standard underlayer has been carried out with success. Despite this, double-layer spinning brings drawbacks at manufacturing level, increasing the cost and limiting the tools\u2019 throughput. A new solution, resulting from the chemical tuning of the material exploiting the Marangoni effect has brought to the synthesis of a new single-layer planarization material, with properties similar to the previously tested double-layer approach. This advanced material opens the pathway to an alternative and cost-effective way to solve the issues typical of this module integration.", "The continued miniaturization of integrated circuit features has been made possible through multilayer patterning processes where different etch steps transfer the patterned photoresist image through various hardmasks and ultimately to the underlying substrate. Spin-on carbons (SOCs) are a type of a solution-dispensable carbon hardmask that can offer excellent resistance to various etch gases for good pattern transfer fidelity, while simultaneously conferring desirable gap fill and planarization properties onto the underlying substrate. We recently reported on the development of a new SOC platform with excellent etch resistance, having a relative reactive ion etch (RIE) rate of 1.08 compared to amorphous carbon. However, one drawback we observed for this polymer was its relatively high absorbance between 400-700 nm which can complicate lithographic alignment. Here we report our work on reducing the absorbance of our SOC platform while maintaining its excellent etch resistance. We identify that the origin of high absorbance is from side reactions that occur during curing and discuss the various polymer modifications or additives that prevent these unwanted processes. We additionally look at any trade-offs that are observed between decreasing absorbance and etch resistance and optimize the SOC\u2019s composition to minimize absorbance while having a minimal effect on its etch resistance.", "Metal impurities in lithography materials are becoming a serious problem in leading-edge semiconductor device manufacturing.

The emphasis on minimizing residual particles, metals, and organics coming from materials and equipment continues to increase. Filter design and its key sub-components such as membrane continue to play a significant role to enhance performance in EUV lithography by reducing defectivity. This necessitates an improvement in retention and cleanliness for both bulk and point-of-use (POU) filters. While POU filtration targets high retention, typically achieved by membrane\u2019s reduced pore size, the main requirement of bulk filtration is maximizing the amount of material recirculated through the filter per unit of time and is achieved with improved tortuosity and well-defined pore structure. In this study, we present a novel HDPE filter specifically designed to provide a high flow (lower differential pressure) without sacrificing retention characteristics. The new membrane was assembled in a POU filter format and compared head-to-head with a state-of-the-art HDPE membrane filter for POU application. The flow performance was assessed by differential pressure (dP) measurement, which showed an enhanced performance benefit of dP reduction by 50% compared to the reference filter, while all other test parameters are improved or at least comparable. The filter cleanliness was quantified by liquid particle counter (LPC), GC-MS, and ICP/MS measurements.

Rough sidewalls scatter electromagnetic radiation and lead to significant losses. Prototyping of state-of-the-art silicon photonic devices on full wafer scale requires maskless manufacturing. Therefore, variable shaped electron-beam lithography in chemically amplified photoresists and anisotropic etching processes are used. As a result, size and roughness errors in the photoresist structures are directly transferred to the silicon-waveguides. In this study a high-resolution chemically amplified negative photoresist for electron-beam writing was run in and optimized for photonic device manufacturing successfully. The investigation of the photoresist contrast and critical dimensions enabled the production of smooth and critical dimension stable lines in photoresist, which exhibit vertical sidewalls as well as a resolution limit far below 100 nm.", "In this presentation, we show our efforts toward the discovery of extreme UV (EUV) resists based on the radical reactions that highly fluorinated molecular units undergo. Recently, we reported that small molecules equipped with perfluoroalkyl ether (PFAE) chains or fluoroarene units show solubility change under high-energy electron beam (e-beam) or EUV light via intermolecular chemical network formation. Although this non-chemical amplification-type imaging mechanism worked without the help of any catalytic species, its low sensitivity characteristics had to be improved for practical use. A solution was sought in polymeric resist platforms, particularly those possessing a uniform composition and high enough glass transition temperature (Tg). A perfluoroalkyl moiety was introduced to maleimide (Mi) to give RFMi, which could then be copolymerized in an alternating manner with styrene (P1) and a styrenic derivative containing a Sn atom (P2) or acid-labile protective group (P3). By using a reversible deactivation radical polymerization method, the copolymers could have narrow molecular weight distributions (polydispersity index (PDI) < 1.5) along with their uniform monomer compositions. Thanks to the rigid backbone structure enabled by the maleimide units, the perfluoroalkylated copolymers could be characterized by high Tgs over 100\u2021C. When lithographic patterning tests were performed under EUV exposure conditions, the thin films of all the alternating copolymers could be tailored down to the 30-nm size, and in particular, the one with Sn atoms (P2) made patterns with 22 mJ/cm2. These results demonstrate the useful nature of the imaging chemistry that highly fluorinated molecular units enable under high energy radiation.", "Whilst traditional chemically amplified resists (CAR) support the initial insertion of EUV lithography, a wide range of other resist materials are being examined for future nodes, aiming to identify a photoresist that simultaneously meets RLS and defectivity requirements. It is becoming increasingly clear that this should involve a novel mechanism\u2014a new chemistry that can be tuned to allow for improvement of the RLS requirements. One potential approach is the multi-trigger concept wherein a reaction will only occur when multiple elements of the resist are initiated concurrently and in close spatial proximity. At the centre of exposed features, where the exposure dose is sufficient the resist reaction is thus catalytic as in a CAR, but at the edge of the features the reaction is secondorder in nature, and thus the chemical gradient is increased. In effect the resist features an intrinsic, inversely dose dependent, quenching of the catalysis, enhancing chemical contrast and thus resolution, and reducing roughness, whilst eliminating the materials stochastics impact of a separate quencher. The multi-trigger material previously presented consists of a base molecule and a crosslinker, which represent the resist matrix, together with a photoacid generator (PAG). Research has been undertaken to improve this resist, in particular focusing on improving resist opacity and crosslinking density. Our work on high-Z cross-linker molecules mark I and mark II has previously been reported and LER figures below 3 nm for lines and spaces patterned at 14 nm half pitch using the high opacity MTR resist on the EUV-IL exposure tool at PSI were shown.

We report results obtained using the new MTR system containing the high-Z cross-linker mark III, with a variation of process conditions and formulation variations. The lithographic performance, of a formulation containing this crosslinker, at pitch 32nm patterned on an NXE3350 is presented A biased LWR of 4.2 nm for a line width of 15.1 nm is shown. Introducing a PEB induces performance changes for the MTR4L3Y(2) resist. The sensitivity improves by over 20% with 80 \u00b0C PEB. However, the PEB does lead to a 12% increase of the LWR. Overall, the lowest Z factor (using biased LWR) occurs with a 60 \u00b0C PEB temperature. The Z factor is also significantly lower with a film thickness of 22.5 nm compared to 20 nm. The thickest film thickness tested using the NXE3350 is 22.5 nm. However, at PSI, 12 nm lines on a 28 nm pitch were patterned with an LWR of 2.07 nm using a film thickness of 25 nm. In addition to varying the opacity of the resist, we have also investigated increasing the activation energy of the selfquenching aspect of the MTR system. In this case, MTR8 has a higher activation energy than MTR4. Having a higher activation energy should allow introduction of PEB to increase crosslinking and reduce pattern collapse, whilst simultaneously preserving the self-quenching behaviour. We present results which show a decrease in dose and Zfactor using MTR8 at this formulation ratio compared to MTR4, when tested at PSI. The results also show a Z factor improvement when using a 60 \u00b0C PEB. A standard opacity multi trigger resist was patterned on the MET5 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the effect of different development processes was studied using 1:1 dense line features at pitch 32nm. Reducing the development time in nBA had an adverse effect on pattern collapse and LWR. However, changing to on track development process using 2-heptanone gives a 10% LWR improvement at the 25 nm film thickness studied. Additionally, a pillar pattern was studied when using a film thickness of 28 nm. Here we present pillars with a LCDU of 1.85 nm with a CD of 21.4 nm patterned at a 40 nm pitch.", "The enhancement in chemical gradients between the EUV exposed and unexposed areas can generate a wider process window, possibly, a smaller stochastic defectivity, and a lower local CD uniformity in EUV resists. This enhancement, in turn, helps to overcome the challenge of the small process window in high NA EUV lithography. In this work, a new concept resist, which is developed based on our chemical gradient enhancement technique model, is used to drive the chemical gradient upward chemically. The resist also has the capability of absorbing UV selectively at EUV exposed areas. Therefore, the UV flood exposure system, which has been discussed in Photosensitized Chemically Amplified ResistTM (PSCARTM), is used as another key part to further enhance the new resist. The new concept resist with UV lights was confirmed to give 15.1% improvement in its EUV sensitivity and, simultaneously, 25.0% improvement in local CD uniformity. This technique might be one of the solutions to bring CAR resist further into high-NA EUV lithography.", "Currently, there are many developments in the field of EUV lithography that are helping to move it towards increased high volume manufacturing (HVM) feasibility. Targeted improvements in hardware design for advanced lithography are of key interest to our group, specifically metrics such as line width roughness (LWR) smoothing, dose reduction processes, and defect mitigation. In this study, we investigate how novel hardware solutions currently available on our SCREEN DT-3000 coat-develop track system, can be used as complementary non-patterning approaches to boost resist scaling even further. The utility of SCREEN non-standard hardware features to enhance overall lithography performance of a main chain scission EUV resist was deeply explored, and new process approaches were successfully identified. We hereby present our work utilizing the SCREEN DT- 3000 coat-develop track system with an ASML NXE:3400 to improve sensitivity, CD uniformity, line width roughness, and defectivity levels of aggressive dense L/S patterns.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) is one of the candidates for next generation lithography. Over the past years, many papers and presentation have been reported regarding DSA, and Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL is a registered trademark or a trademark of Tokyo Electron Limited in Japan and /or other countries.) also has presented the evaluation results and the advantages of each1-10. Polystyrene-b-polymethyl methacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) has been used in many report because the polymerization technology is established and it is easy to form vertical patterns. In addition, the chemical epitaxy flow for PS-b-PMMA has established well to improve defectivity, line edge roughness and line width roughness. On the other hand, it is difficult to achieve less than 24nm pitch pattern by PS-b-PMMA because of the low chi parameter. In this paper, the combination process of DSA and SADP (self-aligned double pattern) is proposed for further small pitch pattern by PS-b- PMMA and latest results are reported.", "Results for the self-assembly of lamellar silicon-containing high-\u03c7 block copolymers (BCP) with innovative neutral top-coat design are presented. We demonstrate that these materials and associated processes are compatible with a standard lithographic process, and oriented toward a potential high volume manufacturing. We show that this dedicated technology is able to guarantee the stability and planarity of the stack even at elevated self-assembly bake temperatures, and opens new opportunity in the fields of 3D BCPs stacks. Finally, we show interesting results for the etch-transfer of a lamellar BCP in silicon.", "In contrast to the technology relying on the reaction of photosensitive materials with light, directed self-assembly (DSA) uses the microphase separation of block copolymer (BCP) to define the pattern. Because of the inherently different nature of pattern formation, L/S pattern with the pitch around 30 nm has been demonstrated with DSA of PS-b-PMMA system without suffering from typical challenges of EUV resist pattern. Instead, the major challenge was to control DSA-specific defects, which is the result of the non-ideal assembly of BCP, within timescale acceptable for high volume manufacturing. Holistic optimization of material and process conditions enables low and stable defectivity of DSA process with improved throughput. In this paper, the key learning from PS-b-PMMA system will be thoroughly reviewed. And the strategy to leverage this learning for developing high-chi DSA system will be discussed.", "Photo-directed orientation control of block copolymer (BCP) domains is a powerful method for generating distinct regions of perpendicular and parallel-aligned lamella in a single film layer. In this study we demonstrate the versatility of Poly(aryl methacrylate) films for controlling the wetting behaviour of PS-b-PMMA films after UV irradiation. Upon exposure to UV light (254 nm), the surface polarity of Poly(aryl methacrylate) films changed due to the photo-Fries rearrangement of the aromatic ester groups. The switch of PS-b-PMMA alignment from parallel to perpendicular lamellar structures was demonstrated after UV exposure to appropriate doses of poly(aryl methacrylate) films. The UV dose required to switch alignment and orientation in a wide range of BCP films can be tailored by rational structural design of the poly(aryl methacrylate). This simple, rapid, cost-effective and flexible approach to controlling BCP orientation makes this photo-directing chemoepitaxy approach promising for block copolymer self-assembly applications.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "As the design layout of integrated circuits (ICs) is continually scaling down, sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) have been extensively used in resolution enhancement technique (RET) applications to enhance lithography printing fidelity and widen the manufacturing process window (PW). With conventional SRAF insertion techniques, rule-based SRAF (RB-SRAF) and model-based SRAF (MB-SRAF) methods have been widely adopted. The typical RB-SRAF is an efficient method to generate SRAFs consistently for simple designs, but cannot be optimized for multiple critical patterns or complex layout schemes. Although MB-SRAF is able to achieve better process window as well as reducing conflicts between placement rules and clean-up rules, many iterations for convergence and extremely high computational costs are required. The explosion of machine learning techniques could facilitate the complex processes of mask optimization, such as SRAF insertion. In this paper, generative adversarial network was studied on a Via layer of advanced 3D NAND flash memory, by training target images and Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) images of target patterns. GAN models, pix2pix and CycleGAN, were first trained and then utilized to synthesize realistic ILT images. These ILT images were eventually translated to polygons of SRAF with simplification process and mask manufacturing rules check (MRC) constraints. The simulation results demonstrate that CycleGAN approach can place SRAF with comparable performance to mask optimization (MO) result which was optimized by the Tachyon Source-Mask Optimizer (SMO). Most importantly, the efficiency of SRAF insertion can be enhanced significantly through the generative adversarial network.", "Fast computation of process variation band (PVB) is critical for several lithography applications such as yield estimation, hotspot detection, mask optimization, and etc. Conventionally, PVB is computed by lithography simulation that is very slow and can only be applied for a small part of a chip. These small parts of a chip are identified through a pattern matching process, where unseen patterns are often missed. We explore conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), a couple of machine learning models, for predicting PVB with high speed and sufficient accuracy. In our proposed method, we divide a full-chip into several small clips and then predict PVB for a small region of interest at the center of each clip. Experiments show that our proposed method can successfully predict PVB for more than 98% of the patterns with an average accuracy, and speedup of 86%, and 500 times, respectively, compared to the rigorous lithography simulation.", "Data sampling is a corner stone in any machine learning applications, and ML-OPC is no different. As feature resolution and process variations continue to shrink for new nodes of both DUV and EUV lithography, the amount of data that can be collected can be enormous, and smart advanced data sampling will be indeed needed. In last year\u2019s SPIE paper in Refs. 1, we explored how can we utilize parametric test patterns to augment random sampling to collect an improved training data set. Given that random sampling has been good enough for some older technology nodes, a new advanced way to sample the data became inevitable for newer nodes. In this paper, we explore a few techniques to improve the quality of the ML-OPC training data. We show how different sampling methodologies can affect the training and inference results. We start by exploring different techniques then compare the results of different sampling techniques using both geometrical and image parameters and compare to regular random sampling results. We will also show how the Proteus capsules made this work easy and accessible for the user. At the end, we will show how this work can be integrated in one Proteus Workflow (PWF) for easier exploration for the results.", "Semiconductor manufacturing equipment must maintain high productivity and provide high-yield processing and Canon has developing high-reliability exposure tools that have demonstrated high-uptime and performance stability in production. As global emergency epidemic restrictions limit the travel of expert engineers, customer service becomes more challenging and alternative methods of support are being developed to help customers meet their production roadmaps. To help control performance, lithography tools have sophisticated logging systems that can monitor every movement in the tool and we studied a novel Artificial Intelligence system that utilizes big logging data to help improve exposure tool uptime, productivity and performance related to yield. One goal of our study is to minimize exposure tool downtime by monitoring and reacting to tool status. For this purpose we are applying machine learning to develop abnormality detection or prediction models with automated recovery procedures for each abnormality. We will report on Auto-Fault-Tree-Analysis (FTA) models being constructed to evaluate large volumes of design and trouble information to help minimize downtime. Another study goal is to improve lithography tool performance by monitoring and reacting to factors including overlay accuracy and CD uniformity that can strongly affect device yield. Outputs of this analysis include simulation and optimization of equipment performance, and virtual metrology. This paper reports on the system we are developing to help increase the uptime, productivity and imaging performance of Canon semiconductor lithography tools. The system is designed to monitor the operating state of lithography tools and apply automated recovery and optimization actions identified through machine learning.", "Digital Scanner (DS), a DUV optical maskless exposure tool is being developed. It uses a micromirror-type spatial light modulator (SLM) to create the \u201cmask\u201d pattern combined with a solid state laser with wavelength of 193 or 248 nm. The exposure concept of DS and advantage of solid state laser as an exposure light source is described. DS proof-of-concept tool with resolution of half-pitch 80 nm L/S was developed.

One major barrier in adoption of ILT was mask writer\u2019s inability to efficiently write curvilinear patterns. With the introduction of multi-beam mask writers [1] [2], this barrier has been removed and widespread adoption of ILT is imminent. Traditionally, mask writers have accepted only trapezoidal inputs to the tool, though recent trends show that mask writers are adopting to newer formats which already reduce file size. However, as the ILT shape complexity and data volume increases further for 5nm nodes and beyond, the explosion of mask pattern data file size becomes a major concern. Therefore, there is a need for the industry to look towards other compact formats of data representation that will be capable of serving well for multiple generations of mask making. In this paper we will be comparing various curvilinear data representation schemes and their value in the curvilinear ILT based mask manufacturing flow. We will demonstrate that given the nature of curvilinear data, representing it using native curve formats has lot of value in terms of file size reduction for futuristic mask making flows. Same format may not be applicable for all type of features in the input mask. These options will be discussed. There is also a need to compare the value of such exotic representations with regular simplification approaches that reduce data volume using standard methods. We will make that comparison in the paper and discuss the extents/limits of all these techniques. Comparison of changes in simulated mask contours and wafer contours will also be made.", "More-than-Moore approaches to improve system performance have been a hot topic for a more than a decade as a way to maximize the efficiency and increase the bandwidth of high performance computing systems. Fan-Out packaging that realizes submicron Redistribution Lines (RDL) and large die sizes is one technology that can help enable complex heterogeneous integration for applications including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving. For systems requiring large package sizes, Panel Level Packaging (PLP) can offer efficiency and cost advantages over Wafer Level Packaging (WLP). PLP however poses unique technical challenges including the requirement to realize uniform submicron patterning across the entire rectangular panel. To meet this challenge, Canon developed the first patterning exposure tool (stepper) capable of submicron resolution on 500 mm panels. The panel exposure tool is equipped with wide-field projection optics that offer a large 52 mm \u00d7 68 mm image field and a 0.24 NA that is optimum for submicron resolution. The stepper also features an updated panel handling system for processing up to 515 \u00d7 515 mm panels. In this paper, we will report on our study of fine patterning on rectangular panels using the submicron resolution panel stepper and will introduce technology innovations supporting advanced heterogeneous integration. Our study researched photoresist material performance and slit-coating uniformity challenges we identified through collaboration with resist vendors and slit-coating equipment manufacturers. We will report on the results of our collaborative study and will discuss current and future PLP advantages, challenges and solutions.", "Chipmakers have used cross-platform of both EUV exposure and ArF immersion multi-patterning exposure depending on cost effectiveness at each layer.\u3000 ArF immersion exposure has been required lower linewidth roughness(LWR) to reduce cross matched machine overlay(xMMO) which is the overlay between the different platforms. ArF light sources essentially produce speckle as non-uniform intensity distribution resulting from interference effects generated within a beam. It leads to increase LWR, which results in increasing xMMO. The latest ArF immersion light source, GT66A is introduced a new optical pulse stretcher(OPS) that increases pulse duration to reduce speckle by 30% to improves LWR, which reduces xMMO. This technology will improve chip yield for chipmakers in the processes mixed ArF immersion exposure and EUV exposure.", "Over the years, lithography engineers have continued to focus on CD control, overlay and process capability to meet node requirements for yield and device performance. Previous work by Fukuda1 developed a multi-exposure technique at multi-focus positions to image contact holes with adequate DOF. Lalovic2 demonstrated a fixed 2-wavelength technique to improve DOF called RELAX. The concept of multi-focal imaging (MFI) was introduced3 demonstrating two focal positions are created that are averaged over the exposure field, this wavelength \u201cdithering\u201d approach which can be turned on and off, thus eliminating any potential scanner calibration issues. In this work, the application of this imaging method (1 exposure-2 focus positions) can be used in thick photoresist and high aspect ratio applications. An example of thick photoresist imaging is shown in figure 1. We demonstrate 5um line and space features in 10um of photoresist at 3 different imaging conditions. On the left, single focus imaging (SFI) at best dose and focus, the center image which is also SFI but at a defocus of +3.2um. On the right is MFI with 2 focus positions of 0 and 2.8um. Here we can see a significant improvement in the SWA linearity and image profile quality. A second example of high aspect ratio imaging using MFI is shown in figure 2. The aspect ratio of 13:1 is shown for this. The use of Tachyon KrF MFI source \u2013 mask optimization flow will be reviewed to demonstrate optimum conditions to achieve Customer required imaging to meet specific layer requirements.", "PTD photoresists are still the main type of photoresists used for tight pitch layers in advanced patterning. Recent experimental results show evidence that the same mechanical deformation behaviors seen in NTD photoresist process also exist in PTD photoresist processes. These PTD photoresist deformation behaviors cause CD differences which significantly impact CD control budgets in modern technology nodes. Therefore, there is a strong need to accurately model PTD photoresist deformation effects in compact OPC models. In this paper we discuss the polymer physics relevant to physical deformation in PTD photoresists in comparison to NTD photoresists", "Computational lithography applications for OPC/ RET utilize models that represent the lithographic process in simulations. The quality of OPC/ RET wafer results strongly depends on the quality of the model. Hence, achieving model quality and experimental match is the goal of the model calibration process where models are calibrated to experimental data. Ideally, the model would be calibrated and validated to a data set that completely covers the entire design space and all process conditions. A promising alternative to the traditionally applied SEM-CD-based model calibration is the calibration to pattern contours directly with benefits in design space coverage, reduced metrology effort and data preparation complexity. However, contour calibration also demands a new standard operating procedure for contour specific metrology, pattern design and calibration. Goal of this work is to develop and exercise a full contour-based calibration methodology. Firstly, we discuss preconditions for a successful calibration: good quality contour input data, predictive modeling of optics, mask topography and 3D resist and additional calibrator functionality to include aspects of alignment and pattern specific measurement confidence. Secondly, we assess pattern for their calibration-suitability using a metric for pattern information density. Experiments are performed to show the applicability of the metric and the potential to calibrate to a minimal set of patterns. A model calibrated to a well selected single 2.25 \u03bcm2 contour is predicting a large set of pattern contours, 3D resist characteristics and SEM-CD focus-exposure process windows.", "The fast rigorous model (FRM) is a first principles solver based on sequential simulations of photochemical reactions in photoresists. We report the evaluation of FRM relative to compact models (CM1) for NTD OPC model accuracy. We demonstrate equivalent or better accuracy to CM1 when FRM is combined with a CM1 model of the same composition. In the case of CTR to FRM comparison, FRM is 34% more accurate in calibration and prediction on average across 20 testcases. FRM is 5% more predictive than the most complex CM1 modelform tested with similar calibration accuracy. FRM supplemented with limited CM1 terms provides better verification accuracy for SRAF printing and hotspot detection. Further, the input data needed to train the FRM model in order to achieve high predictive accuracy is a fraction (1-5%) of that needed by more complex CM1 modelforms. Finally, we show through the Akaike Information Criteria method that FRM is more predictive than an equivalent CM1 model based on the degrees of freedom in the modelform and quantity of data available.", "Accurate and fast lithography model is necessary for computational lithography applications such as optical proximity correction (OPC) and lithography rule check. In lithography model, optical model calculates image intensity followed by resist model that outputs a resist contour. Resist model is an empirical model, in which images are convolved with resist kernels and their weighted sum is used to derive a resist model signal that is compared with some threshold. Conventional resist model use a simple form of resist kernels such as Gaussian kernels, therefore it requires many kernels to achieve high accuracy. We propose to use free-form resist kernels. Resist model has the same structure as convolutional neural network (CNN), thus, we represent resist model with free-form kernels in CNN and train the network. To avoid overfitting of the proposed model, we initialize the model with conventional Gaussian kernels. Training data is carefully selected so that resist contour is accurately predicted. A conventional resist model with 9 Gaussian kernels is converted into a model with 2 free-form kernels, which achieves 35% faster lithography simulation. In addition, simulation accuracy in CD is improved by 15%.", "In world-leading semiconductor manufacturing, the device feature size keeps on reducing and with it processes become more challenging in the next technology node. The On Product Overlay (OPO) budget is therefore required to reduce further. Alignment is one of the key factors in reducing overlay wafer to wafer (W2W) variations. To save product area and reduce scribe line width, small alignment mark is evaluated to achieve the similar results as reference mark and to optimize the OPO performance. In this work, we will show the experimental results of small alignment mark and investigate the on product overlay performance by simulation.", "Improving on product overlay is one of the key challenges when shrinking technology nodes in semiconductor manufacturing. Using information from non-lithography process steps can unleash overlay improvement potential.1 The challenge is to find intra-wafer signatures by measuring planar distortion. Several previous applications showed that using exposure tool wafer alignment data can improve overlay performance.2 With smart placement of alignment mark pairs in the X and Y direction, it is possible to determine intra-wafer distortion wafer-by-wafer. Both the measurement and modeled results are applied directly as a feed-forward correction to enable wafer level control. In this paper, the capability to do this is evaluated in a feasibility study.", "In this paper we present the key enhancements incorporated in the new NXT platform and also share future development steps enabled by the platform. These innovations build on driving the system productivity while in parallel improving the overlay performance and at the same time minimizing the scanner grid differences between NXT-based ArF/ArFi/KrF and NXE-based EUV scanners. Both hardware as well as software improvements play an important role in improving cross-matching overlay performance. On the hardware side, changes have been introduced to key modules such as the projection lens and the reticle stage to better match to EUV layers. Furthermore, the new NXT platform introduces a more powerful wafer stage to support better overlay accuracy as well as improved productivity. Complementary software-based corrections are developed to further correct for grid imperfections. For instance to reduce the impact of DUV pellicle distortions, onscanner real-time corrections have been added to the scanner metrology control architecture. \u2018Maximizing the number of good-wafers-per-day\u2019 has been the guiding principle for the development of the new NXT platform. Apart from driving the scanner productivity along the traditional wafer-per-hour metric, advancements have been implemented to improve the operational efficiency of the scanner on production use-cases while also minimizing the time spent on required system maintenance. This all to maximize the effective scanner output under HVM conditions. The new NXT platform is currently being rolled out for the most advanced immersion and ArF scanners \u2013 the NXT:2050i and the NXT:1470. Going forward, it will support further productivity steps and improved overlay accuracy and EUV matching developments. The platform is also prepared to support KrF scanners in the near future, where especially the productivity will be stretched for this wavelength. Longer term this platform will serve as the stepping stone towards significantly higher wafers-per-day productivity levels and sub-nm overlay accuracy.", "In the last decade, Photonics Technology has been an emerging technology for optical telecommunications and for optical interconnects in microelectronics. As a result, a large diversity of Photonics design methodologies has merged with very challenging scales and shapes. Manufacturing such curvy and critical photonics shapes requires advanced Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RET) including Inverse Lithography Techniques (ILT) with 193nm immersion lithography. In this paper, we investigate the manufacturing challenges of several Photonics devices using advanced ILT solutions and the SRAF insertion impact on delivering good litho quality including EPE, PVband and LER.

Generally, the process-aware (defocus and dose) inverse lithography is realized through the stochastic gradient decent (SGD) method. In this paper, a widely used search algorithm Adam is introduced for our inverse lithography framework. The new algorithm utilizes the first and second moments of gradients to adapt the learning rate for each individual pixel during the stochastic searching process. Unlike SGD, such derived learning rate is invariant to the magnitude of gradient. In our experiment, we demonstrated reduced edge placement error (EPE), enlarged process window and tighter critical dimension (CD) distribution with Adam on our test cases of isolated features. We believe that the inverse lithography with Adam algorithm is also applicable to dense features with the similar benefits.", "While technology is being developed, design rules undergo a number of revisions. An initial lithography model built with test patterns before the revisions inherently become inaccurate for the revised patterns. Preparing a new test layout and updating a lithography model every time design rules are revised is not practical, and cannot be a solution. We prepare some synthetic patterns in addition to initial test patterns. Synthetic patterns originate from popular test pattern generator (TPG), while projected design rule changes are taken into account. A challenge is to sort out the synthetic patterns which are really necessary in building a generic lithography model when they are used together with test patterns. Each pattern, either synthetic or test, is identified in image parameter set (IPS) space. For each test pattern in IPS space, two concentric spheres are drawn; outer one indicating the region where revised versions of test pattern may exist, and inner one indicating the region which is well covered by test pattern alone. Synthetic patterns that reside in the region bounded by the two spheres are kept, while the others are dropped. Clustering is now performed on test patterns and synthetic patterns separately, and representative pattern is drawn from each cluster. When a set of representative patterns are used to build a lithography model in 10nm memory devices, it achieves 43.5% lower CD root mean square error (RMSE) for revised design layout compared with only using a set of initial test patterns.", "In this paper, we will present a machine learning solution targeted for memory customers including both assist feature and main feature mask synthesis. In a previous paper, we demonstrated machine learning ILT solutions for the creation of assist features using a neural network. In this paper, we extend the solution to include main features masks, which we can create using machine learning models which take into account the full ILT corrected masks during training. In practice, while the correction of main features is often visually more intuitive, there are underlying edge to edge and polygon to polygon interactions that are not easily captured by local influence edge perturbations found in typical OPC solvers but can be captured by ILT and machine learning solutions trained on ILT masks.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "The power spectral density (PSD) is a powerful mathematical tool for characterizing roughness as a function of frequency (or length scale).

In this tutorial, the definition, measurement, and use of the PSD will be described for LER/LWR characterization. Sources of errors (biases, both systematic and random) will be discussed as well as their mitigation. Finally, interpretation of the shape of the PSD and its meaning in the context of patterning will be briefly addressed.", "The extraordinary success story that is Moore\u2019s Law required many technological components to come together at the right times. This tutorial will tell this story through the lens of one of the key components: the patterning materials, in particular the photoresists. Every chip ever produced has used some form of microlithography, usually photolithography, which has historically been the gating technology for how quickly features sizes could be shrunk. Starting with cyclized rubber resists, the industry went on to use DNQ Novolak systems for a quarter century, before switching wavelengths from near-UV to 248 and 193 nm, then to 193 nm immersion. Every one of these switches required the invention of a new photoresist platform, new resin systems and even new imaging concepts, such as the use of chemically amplified resists beginning with 248 nm. For the materials scientist, Moore\u2019s Law has historically been a race to the next wavelength. This sequence of more or less frantic developments is coming to an end as we near the physical limits of microlithography. With the introduction of EUV lithography, the finish line of this race is in sight: today\u2019s EUV resists are still far from perfect, and this presentation will cover their issues and the paths forward, but there can be no doubt that with EUV, we have reached what appears to be the Final Wavelength. However, the need for better, faster, cheaper process options will not go away, and bottom up technologies such as DSA, selective or self-aligned patterning, and other processes with atomic level precision will need to continue to be developed. The future will see new non-CMOS device types and possibly even circuits which function according to the laws of relativistic quantum physics, all of which will require new materials and bring new challenges. While photolithography is entering its end game, the job of the material scientists is far from done. The presented manuscript is a slide deck, not a formal SPIE conference proceedings paper.", "Semiconductor demand is rapidly expanding beyond the computing and mobile markets with more products being introduced for automotive, industrial, medical, avionics, and space applications. Chips are increasingly complex with growing functionality through integration of more digital, analog/mixed-signal, and RF sub-systems. Technologies still continue to scale to ever-shrinking dimensions with novel materials and device architectures to realize new power-performance-area levels. Although these new capabilities enable diversified product opportunities, guaranteeing reliability and quality over long product lifetimes has become increasingly challenging in such applications. This paper provides an overview of reliability and product quality challenges in advanced CMOS nodes comprising finFET and fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technologies. Following an overview of intrinsic and extrinsic reliability mechanisms along with design and test methodologies for improving reliability and product quality, it addresses key reliability challenges in fully depleted technologies, such as self-heating, I/O scaling, middle-of-line reliability, dielectric-breakdown monitoring, variation, and stochastic aging. To meet these more stringent requirements in advanced technologies, chip designers and manufacturers must collaboratively optimize chip process technology, design, and test in an even more cohesive and transparent partnership.", "Highly reliable technology and design are vital to the future of the semiconductor industry for three reasons namely, technology scaling, new materials and new workload. Firstly, geometry scaling of technology has exacerbated multiple reliability phenomena, and managing the reliability of these devices itself has limited performance and target design metrics. For example, interconnects are heavily resistive today at sub-7nm nodes, serving as a key bottleneck in high-performance designs. One of the main reasons is that the copper wires require thick barrier-liners that consume useful conductor area to maintain wire reliability. Worsening back-end-of-the-line electromigration (EM) at advanced nodes also forces designers to limit high-performance gates in design, therefore limiting the peak design performance. Secondly, the rapid increase in the number of new materials introduced to further Moore\u2019s law scaling has exposed designers to work with devices of little or unknown reliability, potentially leading to too much pessimism in guard-banding while designing for these new devices. Understanding the underlying failure mechanisms and quantifying their impact is key to determining the right design practices. The introduction of new wire materials like Cobalt/Ruthenium after almost two decades of copper wires is one such example, having non-trivial implications on how we design power delivery and implement designs today. Lastly, the rapid growth in computing demand in the era of AI/ML has translated into new workloads that stress the underlying devices very uniquely and demand different levels of guarantee; design-for-reliability is imperative for \u201calways-on\u201d applications like High-Performance-Compute and mission-critical applications such as autonomous drive. Device-level understanding and faithful modeling of both, the physical effects such as aging, time-dependent-dielectric breakdown, etc., as well as electrical mechanisms that cause transient errors in design is paramount. Aging effects at the device level are typically combated by guard banding at the design level; bias-temperature-instability (BTI) aging effects and electromigration of wires that have \u201chealing\u201d capabilities could be offset by balancing bias states in design. Effects such as hot-carrier-injection (HCI) that cause damage to the drain of the transistor cannot be compensated for at the design level and the time-to-failure is modeled in such cases. For transient errors (soft errors) that could corrupt stored data due to particle strikes, novel circuit design techniques are utilized to reduce their probability; for example, a \u201cpopular vote\u201d scheme could be used by replicating logic and strategically spacing them apart; however, this would have a negative implication on the design area. Hence it is key to determine which part of the design is most affected by such faults that are heavily workload dependent. Additionally, memory blocks, flip flops, and logic blocks are uniquely impacted by such faults requiring different compensating techniques. In this talk, a brief overview of the physical and electrical failure mechanisms at advanced nodes will be provided. Popular modeling and design practices for handling the reliability of modern designs shall be discussed and trends will be reviewed highlighting the importance of design-technology-reliability-co-optimization techniques to enable future designs.", "The required reliability of a system depends on its intended market. Consumer electronics have a high tolerance for faults, IBM Enterprise Systems have a near zero fault requirement, while servers and data centers have a fault tolerance in between the Enterprise and Consumer markets. To manufacture high performance computing systems that are highly reliable, IBM uses an end to end strategy which includes Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS). Reliability must be built into the system at all levels, from the transistor to the circuit to the complete system. This talk will explore aspects of IBM\u2019s RAS strategy including technology qualification, wafer screening, module screening, and the tradeoffs between performance, reliability, and cost.", "The importance of pattern-based defect study has grown with more complex processes in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. The pattern is the heart of the DPTCO Design Process Technology Co-Optimization approach. But the definition of pattern has been limited by the design rules that can be setup by an individual. Moreover, the huge volume of data points generated by any DRC Design Rule Check type of search forces user to sort and filter out most of them and keep only a manageable count. This effectively reduces the sample space of pattern-based learning. In this work we have employed a new approach of PCYM Pattern Centric Yield Manager where the high count of unique patterns and all its instances in full chip design is retained. It is a fundamental pillar of computational system for semiconductor fabrication where pattern-centric learning can be deployed to study any related process.", "Automated generation of Layout Pattern Catalogs (LPC) has been enabled by full-chip pattern matching EDA tools, capable of searching and classifying both topological and dimensional variations in layout shapes, extracting massive datasets of component patterns from one (or more) given layouts. This work presents a novel theoretical framework for the systematic analysis of Layout Pattern Catalogs (LPC). Two algebraic structures (lattices and matroids) are introduced, allowing for the complete characterization of all LPC datasets. Technical results go beyond the general mathematical theory of combinatorial pattern spaces, demonstrating a direct path to novel physical design verification algorithms and DFM optimization applications.", "Mask synthesis and correction flows are becoming increasingly complex in order to deal with increasingly smaller lithography, resist, and etch effects that also increase in importance with increasingly smaller feature sizes. Time-to-mask is also a significant factor in production environments which leads tapeout teams to adopt correction strategies that usually only address effects at the best process condition. As a result, users frequently find hotspots, or process failures, when performing a final lithography verification step using multiple process conditions. In many cases, under production pressure to decrease time-to-mask, tapeout teams choose to correct these hotspots in the fastest manner possible. Performing rule-based fixes to the post-correction layout is usually the fastest method available. This paper will explore using rule-based, post-correction hotspot fixes in a flow using pattern matching. Pattern matching will be used to cluster the post-correction patterns into similar types which will be fixed by different algorithms for each type. Further, pattern matching will be used to find all instances of each pattern to mark for fixing along any similar patterns that may have been missed by the lithography check, or those that received asymmetrical correction.", "Two-dimensional pattern matching libraries are used to define known hotspots in the design space. These libraries can then be integrated into a physical design router to search and fix such hotspots prior to the design being completed and signed off. The task of searching for similar patterns to the known hotspot involves a significant manual effort in pattern match library development. This paper demonstrates an automated and comprehensive approach to profile the available design space for similar topological patterns based on the known hotspot and automatically generate a comprehensive master pattern library to fix and address the hotspot issue. This paper presents a semi-supervised learning algorithm for developing pattern similarity metric for pattern similarity ranking and clustering.", "In the semiconductor fabrication process, yield is negatively impacted by defects that appear systematically within specific patterns of the physical layout design. Those defective patterns are popularly known as hotspots, and they can arise due to various causes. There are several known approaches of hotspot detection. One approach for hotspot detection is Machine Learning (ML), where known hotspot and non-hotspot patterns are used for training the model to be used afterwards in prediction of new hotspots. The objective in ML approaches is to maximize the hit rate (i.e. finding all potential hotspots) and to minimize the false alarm rate (i.e. reduce the overhead of false positives). The model\u2019s ability to correctly classify between hotspots and non-hotspots depends on the coverage of the training data set. The real-world challenge in training a ML system to classify hotspots/non-hotspots is the imbalanced nature of the problem, where the known hotspot patterns are always in the minority class. Another challenge specific to the problem of hotspot classification is the difficulty to correctly classify non-hotspots that are similar to hotspots. These \u201chard-to-classify\u201d patterns are ones with high mask error enhancement factor (MEEF), as small variations in the pattern can make it change between hotspot and non-hotspot. These two challenges cause conventional methods of handling imbalanced training datasets to be inadequate to the problem of hotspot detection. This paper will present a flow for quantified training dataset selection approach and put extra focus on the patterns that are hard to classify due to close similarity with known hotspots. Improved model accuracy is illustrated when adopting the quantified sampling approach compared to conventional sampling approaches.", "As feature resolution and process variations continue to shrink for new nodes of both DUV and EUV lithography, the density and number of devices on advanced semiconductor masks continue to increase rapidly. These advances cause significantly increased pressure on the accuracy and efficiency of OPC mask output. To meet manufacturing yield requirements, systematic errors from all sources are important to consider during mask synthesis. Specifically, accurately considering etch effects within OPC and ILT is becoming more critical. Mask synthesis flows have typically accounted for etch proximity effects using rule-based approaches, and the accuracy limitations of fast etch models has limited wide-spread adoption of model-based etch mask correction approaches. Several publications and industry presentations have discussed the use of neural networks or other machine learning techniques to provide improvements in both accuracy and efficiency in mask synthesis flows. In this paper, we present results of using machine learning in etch models to improve model accuracy without sacrificing TAT. Then we demonstrate an ILT based etch correction method using the machine learning etch model that converges quickly and outputs an ADI target contour to be used as the target for OPC or ILT mask correction.", "By blending physical and virtual worlds, Mixed Reality (MR) is unlocking exciting new experiences and generating new paradigms in both social and professional interactions. Powered by continual advances in computer vision, graphical processing power, display technology, and input systems, MR is strengthening interactions between humans, their environment, and computers and enabling endless new opportunities. To enable a seamless and immersive experience, an MR device is a complex system, comprising of multiple optical, electrical, mechanical and computational sub-systems. Inputs from various user and environment sensors (i.e. head/eye/gesture tracking, depth scanners, etc.) are synthesized and fused with virtual content that is then projected to the user via the display subsystem. Providing a seamlessly integrated experience requires engineering a display around limitations of both optical system design, as well as that of the human visual system. After a brief introduction to Mixed Reality, this talk will aim to provide an overview of a typical MR display system, outline some of the key design parameters and constraints, and provide a few examples of navigating the trade-offs involved.", "Due to a slowdown in gate pitch scaling linked to fundamental physical limitation, standard cell height reduction is needed to achieve the scaling targets. The complementary FET consisting of stacked NMOS on PMOS device is evaluated for both monolithic and sequential integration. Due to double MOL level access, both CFET options combined with buried power rails reduce the standard cell track height down to 4T, also reducing the routing layer usage within the standard cell. The main advantages of sequential CFET over monolithic is the independent optimization of the top and bottom devices, and the possibility of split gate implementation which offers an area gain in complex cells such as flops, at the expenses of higher cost and process complexity.", "This paper presents a new design architecture for advanced logic SRAM cells using six vertical transistors (with carrier transport along the Z direction), stacked one on top of each other. Virtual fabrication technology was used to identify different process integration schemes to enable the fabrication of this architecture with a competitive XY footprint at an advanced logic node: a unit cell area of 0.0093 um2 was demonstrated in this work. This study illustrates that virtual fabrication can be a key enabling element for technology pathfinding, and that it can be used to identify expected module development challenges prior to tape-out or wafer processing.", "In this paper, we describe a framework to enable the memory array simulations for Materials to Systems CooptimizationTM (MSCOTM) flows. The methodology is applied for projected 3 nm logic FinFET technology node SRAM array. To form the SRAM array, a \u201ctiling\u201d approach is utilized, where neighbor cells are created by copying and mirroring the first cell. Then this process is repeated to create the rest of the array. Electrical pulses are applied to the word-line and bit-line to activate the read and write operations. We demonstrate 128 \u00d7128 SRAM array simulations and find that the farthest cell from the word-line driver is vulnerable.", "Advanced CMOS SoCs with more cores and more complex memory hierarchies are hitting the memory wall, especially in intermediate cache levels (L2, L3). Managing the memory wall thus represent major challenge in the design of future systems and should include memory tech tuning, macro design and Logic-to-Memory interconnect optimization using multi-die packages and different 3D structures. To understand the benefits of 3D interconnects on Memory-on-Logic partitioning we analyze four different partitioning options of intermediate (L2) cache assuming high density CuCu hybrid bonding. We observe that the partitioning of the complete sub-system (memory macros and controller logic) is less beneficial with respect to reference 2D integration when compared to memory macro only partitioning schemes. Further, more memory macros are moved from the logic die, better the gains are (up to 40% total wirelength reduction). Such gains come at the expense of higher 3D pin count, motivating finer 3D pitches. Finally, we demonstrate design enablement of 3D aware IR-drop analysis for micro- and nano-TSVs with Buried Power Rail for Back Side power delivery.", "Process optimization is a required step during semiconductor technology pathfinding and device evaluation. Virtual process modeling and 3D fabrication tools can be used to study diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive modeling of process windows and to accelerate process integration. These virtual techniques will become especially valuable as novel gate-all-around devices (GAA) are introduced to replace state-of-the-art FinFET technologies. Model calibration is needed to ensure the accuracy of any virtual fabrication model and requires wafer-based metrology data. Optical scatterometry has established its value in the FinFET era as an effective inline metrology technique due to its accuracy, throughput, and non-destructive nature. In this article, we demonstrate how spectra collected from scatterometry targets can be utilized to resolve sub-nanometer feature changes within a virtual fabrication platform. First, FEOL GAA simulations up to the SiGe epitaxial growth step were performed to establish spectral sensitivity to upstream process changes. A virtual fabrication model was subsequently calibrated using spectra with variations from earlier process steps as model parameters. These variations were accurately pinpointed for unknown spectra via least-square optimization. Additionally, machine learning methods were leveraged to provide instantaneous feedback during the inference phase. Sub-nanometer accuracy was achieved, enabling wide applications in semiconductor technology development. This newly demonstrated capability will be indispensable in GAA commercialization, where 3D metrology and process integration are ongoing challenges.", "We propose a new method applied on Multi-Project Wafer (MPW) reticles to reduce thermal-mechanical stress. Wafer bumping processes generate residual thermal-mechanical stress, causing crack and delamination across wide regions on a wafer. In this paper, we show the work achieving optimized metal layer densities and density gradients across the reticle to minimize the stress effects. We propose a new MPW chip placement flow that places chips on an MPW reticle meeting the minimum density gradients as the placement criterion. The flow also performs inter-die dummy metal fills to optimize densities with regard to each chip density. We show intentional crack-stop dummy metal rings the flow generates surrounding a chip. The dummy rings further reduce the propagation of stress cracks. We show the results of optimized density gradients and crack-stop rings across the chips on an MPW reticle.", "A semiconductor device can pass functionality test in the factory, but later fail in the field due to its extensive use over time or beyond specifications. There are various physical and electrical mechanisms that can contribute to this failure. One such mechanism is the backend time-dependent-dielectric-breakdown (TDDB), where the insulating dielectric becomes conductive due to extensive exposure to electric field. Backend TDDB is commonly discussed in the foundry design rule manuals, where users may find recommended values on the maximum allowable metal and via usage for specific reliability requirement. However, they are rarely turned into checkable rules because of various practical issues. In this paper, we first investigate what these practical issues are. Specifically, we will discuss - device usage: the actual mission profile of how long and how hard a chip is operated; - circuit operation: voltage amplitudes, swing and slew rates of neighboring nets; - test pattern design: how test patterns are designed and data extrapolated to calculate actual circuit patterns. We will then show how actual calculations of failure-in-time rate for SoCs due to backend TDDB are done. From the calculations, we will show what the typical IPs are that suffer from this failure, and the associated design implications on how to minimize the risk.", "Electrical Design-for-Manufacturability (DFM) checks are developed to quantify layout enhancements and their impact on circuit performance for analog designs. A database containing circuit topologies of analog matched devices is built. Then, connectivity checks scan the schematics for topologies from the database. If a matching topology were detected, the matched devices are mapped to layout for layout matching checks. If layout mismatches are detected, electrical DFM checks are used to quantify the imbalance in terms of parasitic resistance and capacitance. The electrical DFM checks are applied to quantify the impact due to routing, fill, and DFM fixing on three, 22nm analog design blocks. Fill insertion\u2019s contribution to RC change is the greatest followed by routing and DFM fixing, with a maximum change of 7%, 5%, and less than 1%, respectively. Symmetry-aware layout insertions preserve the matching of electrical parameters, showing zero mismatch. All designs pass electrical DFM checks as results are within the expected design tolerances.", "Thin mask model has been conventionally used in optical lithography simulation. In this model the diffracted waves from the mask are assumed to be Fourier transform of the mask pattern. In EUV (Extreme UltraViolet) lithography thin mask model is not valid because the absorber thickness is comparable to the mask pattern size. Fourier transformation is not suitable for calculating the diffracted waves from thick masks. Rigorous electromagnetic simulations such as finitedifference time-domain method, rigorous coupled wave analysis and 3D waveguide model are used to calculate the diffracted waves from EUV masks. However, these simulations are highly time consuming. We reduce the calculation time by adapting a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). We calculate the far-field diffraction amplitudes from an EUV mask by using the 3D waveguide model. We divide the diffraction amplitudes into the thin mask amplitudes (Fourier transform of the mask pattern) and the residual mask 3D amplitudes. The incident angle dependence of the mask 3D amplitude for each diffraction order is fitted by using three parameters which represent the on-axis and the off-axis mask 3D effects. We train a CNN where the inputs are 2D mask patterns and the targets are the mask 3D parameters of all diffraction orders. After the training, the CNN successfully predict the mask 3D parameters. The CNN prediction is 5,000 times faster than the electromagnetic simulation. We extend the transmission cross coefficient formula to include the off-axis mask 3D effects. Our formula is applicable to arbitrary source shapes and defocus. We can use the eigen value decomposition method to accelerate the calculation.", "We propose a machine-learning-based mechanism to perform OPC, which is much more efficient than traditional OPC processes in terms of compute resources.   Building a physical model for OPC takes a lot of labor and computational time, for example, model calibration requires thousands of cores for up to ten hours , and , OPC data prepare needs thousands of cores for a couple of days.   We present a way to use learning to produce OPC mask designs from a large amount of lithography target data with a computationally cheap approach. Our technique uses learning based on pairs of lithography target data and OPCed mask. The impact of different learning algorithm on the quality and performance of mask prediction has been studied. We have tested multiple learning algorithm, such as PyTorch, Multilayer perceptron on IBM cloud. Preliminary evaluation of our technique on a standard contact EUV testsite shows accuracy similar to the standard processes using much less compute power.", "We propose the use of machine learning based analytics to simplify OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) model building process which demands concurrent optimization of more than 70 parameters as nodes shrink. We first built a deep neural network architecture to predict the RMS error, for a given set of model parameters. The neural network was trained on existing OPC model parameters and corresponding output RMS data of simulations to achieve an accurate prediction of output RMS for given set of OPC model parameters. Later, a sensitivity analysis-based methodology for recursive partitioning of OPC modelling parameters was employed to reduce the total search space of OPC model simulations. This resulted in reduction of the number of OPC model iterations performed during model tuning by orders of magnitude.", "It is possible to achieve mass production by multiple patterning technology combing with 193 immersion scanners at 7nm technology node. The application of freeform illumination source shapes is a key enabler for continued shrink using 193 nm immersion lithography with 1.35 NA. Source and mask optimization (SMO) is the important resolution enhancement technique (RET) to optimize a satisfied freeform source. Design pattern library can be used to cognize, manage and compare all the continuous changing and iterative physical designs. Our proposed methodology can improve SMO performance by taking advantages of post-color design pattern library and pattern selection method. And process window limiters are the important guidance to optimize parameters of SMO.", "EUV single patterning opportunity for pitch 28nm metal design is explored. Bright field mask combined with a negative tone develop process is used to improve pattern fidelity and overall process window. imec N3 (Foundry N2 equivalent) logic PNR (place and route) designs are used to deliver optimized pupil through source mask optimization and evaluate OPC technology. DFM (Design For Manufacturing) related topics such as dummy metal insertion and design CD retarget are addressed together with critical design rules (e.g. Tip-to-Tip), to provide balanced design and patterning performance. Relevant wafer data are shown as a proof of above optimization process.", "We provide background on differences between traditional and machine learning modeling. We then discuss how these differences impact the different validation needs of traditional and machine learning OPC compact models. We then provide multiple diverse examples of how machine learning OPC compact validation modeling can be appropriately validated both for modeling-specific production requirements such as model signal/contour accuracy, predictiveness, coverage and stability; and also general OPC mask synthesis requirements such as OPC/ILT stability, convergence, etc. Finally we conclude with thoughts on how machine learning modeling methods and their required validation methods are likely to evolve for future technology nodes.", "In this work, we demonstrate our first-principles based methodology to include atomistic level simulations to evaluate the promise of different metals on the performance of MOL/BEOL interconnects. The specific metals that we focus on include Cu, Ru (both fcc and hcp), Co, and Mo where the conductivity of these metals, including the degradation from grain boundaries extracted from ab initio simulations, is included in a parasitic field solver and subsequently used to extract the interconnect parasitics of standard cells. Lithography considerations are addressed through simulations of patterned, \u201creal\u201d wires. PPA is evaluated through simulations of an 128x128 SRAM memory array where we find significant improvement in the read and write delay of 20% and 40%, respectively when we replace M1 with Ru(fcc).", "With the continuous growth in IC manufacturing complexity, developing new process nodes has become an ever increasing challenge. From the initial process node architectural explorations to initial design rule specifications to early RET development and \u201crisk production\u201d early NPI (New Product Introductions), critical decisions with far reaching performance and yield impact must be made. Applying innovative methods to enable early and broad engineered testing informs better architectural decisions and performance tradeoffs. Methods to identify, root-cause, categorize known yield detractors and to flag unknown potentially new risk patterns enable product yield risk mitigation and continuous learning. Accumulated learning from each step, each stage and each new product drives improved testing vehicles, better process optimization, and enhanced PDKs, all leading to more robust designs and ultimately higher performance and improved yield. In this paper, we describe innovative Machine Learning methods in DFM and DTCO Applications to improve test vehicle engineering, inform process development and accelerate process node yield ramp.", "Critical Area Analysis (CAA) is an established DFM tool to assess the defect limited yield of a semiconductor design. However, several factors limit the usefulness of this tool for advanced technology nodes at 28nm and below. Specifically for metal design layers, retargeting has been a successful measure to improve defect limited yield. Retargeting will opportunistically widen lines and space them further apart where possible. Since retargeting happens during the tapeout phase it is not visible to the designer. A critical area analysis solely based on design shapes therefore underestimates defect limited yield by a substantial amount. Furthermore, CAA computation time for large designs has grown exponentially as the grid size of designs has been shrunk with each technology node. For a large design, CAA computation can take weeks and consume large computational resources. We have come up with a new and fast methodology to compute CAA that takes retargeting into account and thus gives far more realistic estimates of defect limited yield. Our method takes advantage of the fact that even large designs usually consist of millions of repetitions of similar design blocks that will report very similar CAA metrics. By training a machine learning model on representative design snippets one can come up with a flow that estimates the CAA of the full chip and runs very fast.", "With the development of process technology nodes, hotspot detection has become a critical process in integrated circuit physical design flow. The machine learning-based method has become a competitive candidate for layout hotspot detector with easy training and high speed. Classic methods usually define hotspot detection as a binary classification problem. However, the designer hopes to further divide the hotspot patterns into a series of levels according to their severity to identify and fix these hotspots. In this paper, we designed a multi-classifier based on the convolutional neural network to realize the detection of various levels of hotspot patterns. Unlike classic cross-entropy loss, we proposed a custom loss function to reduce the difference between false predicted levels and corresponding true levels, reducing the adverse effects caused by misclassified samples. Experimental verification results show that our hotspot detector can correctly classify various hotspots levels and has potential advantages for physical designers to fix hotspots.", "With more advanced semiconductor technologies, identifying process weak points becomes more complex as multiple layers need to be taken into consideration. In recent years, traditional rule based weak point identification has been augmented by pattern matching to pinpoint and fix possible design weak points. Traditional methods of pattern definition are done by profiling the designs for weak points to capture the patterns of interest for applying opportunistic fixes. Patterns are usually handcrafted by taking process information into account, and applying fixes on the design features. Some fail modes have emerged recently that are a result of very complex multi layer interactions. These types of weak points are very difficult to define comprehensively with traditional pattern matching. Recently, deep learning has undergone a rapid development and tools are now available that can learn based on large amounts of process data. We have harnessed this to address the problem of identifying complex weak points with low escape rates. In this paper, we provide a review on a deep learning based weak point detection flow taking retargeting/opc/orc simulations into account as training data. Using the deep learning approach, the process data is abstracted as an encrypted machine learning model, and released to designers as part of the GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF) DRC+ tool. This tool is shipped with the PDK, and can be used to fix the design, mitigating process weak points. This paper begins with a brief introduction to the deep learning TensorFlow model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) widely used for image detection. Then we focus on feature density vector (DSV) generation to extract the layout parameters and labels used for training the model. Experimental analysis is also provided to compare recall and precision metrics of POR and ML methods in detecting the weak point on a via layer at process window conditions. Our case study shows that the ML flow improves the pattern capture rate by 34% over standard hotspot detection methods. As a conclusion, we will also brief on our future work leveraging the ML flow for other weak point detections.", "In semiconductor manufacturing, intellectual property (IP) cores/blocks play a dominant role in modern chip design. The driving factor for IP usage is the time-to-market benefit delivered through design reuse. Today, IP blocks include the entire range of modules, ranging from standard cells, memories, and I/O devices to CPUs. Chip designers need complex IP blocks because modern levels of integration allow chips to be a complete system on chip (SOC), not just components of systems. However, as chips become more complex, IP blocks are subject to more interactions from multiple neighboring modules in the chip. Current IP block quality assurance (QA) flows focus mainly on functional verification, performance verification, and design rule checking (DRC). The standard DRC deck checks for minimum and maximum density rules within the IP block. However, when an IP is placed in an SOC, it may encounter complex surrounding scenarios, as when a low density IP is placed next to a higher density area. During integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing, the resulting proximity effects may cause failures or electrical targeting mismatches within the IP, due to etch micro-loading and long-range CMP interactions. Designers can only locate these chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) hotspots related to IP placement in the SOC near the end of the design flow, which limits any floorplan changes to fix the hotspots. Standalone IP block QA is insufficient to detect possible layout- or floorplan-induced problems that can affect manufacturing. In this paper, we present a CMP modeling methodology to guard-band IP against topography variations that can occur after IP placement in the SOC design. We emulate low, average, and high-density scenarios surrounding the IP blocks, followed by CMP simulations and hotspot detection using silicon-calibrated CMP models. After simulation, guidelines provided to fix these CMP hotspots surrounding the IP blocks during early design stages to improve manufacturability and yield. This flow will make IPs robust from CMP hotspots that typically appear after SOC floorplanning.", "The goal of this paper is to explore machine learning solutions to improve the run-time of model-based retargeting in the mask synthesis flow. The purpose of retargeting is to re-size non-lithography friendly designs so that the design geometries are shifted to a more lithography-robust design space. However, current model-based approaches can take significant run-time. As a result, this step is rarely done in production settings. Different machine learning solutions for resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) have been previously proposed. For instance, to model optical proximity correction (OPC) or inverse lithography (ILT). In this paper, we compare and expand some of these solutions. In the end, we will discuss the experimental results that can achieve a nearly 360x run-time improvement while maintaining similar accuracy to traditional retargeting techniques.", "For advanced technology nodes the design of Standard Cell Libraries is becoming increasingly challenging. This is because with shrinking cell heightsthe available routing resources in the cells are becoming a major lim iting f actor, along with the rising complexity of design rules and technology options. The challenge of designing goodcells holds for both production libraries, where many cells need to be created, as well as for DTCO experiments, where many variations of a smaller library needto be made. Both types of libraries require highly optimized cells, either to have high quality design, or to have accurate PPA assessment during DTCO. Additionally, DTCO no longer meets the needs of today\u2019s technological cha llenges and needs to be extended from Materials to Systems. At Applied Materials we include automatedStandard Cell Librarygeneration into ourMSCOTM (Materials to Systems Co -OptimizationTM) f low. To demonstrate the power of automated Standard Cell Library generation, this paperfocuses on four experiments to a ssess the impact of advancedprocess and design rules and the choice of standard cell architectures;in particular double height cells. The experiments include different technology and architectural choices,such asthe number of tracks, poly silicon and diffusion for routing in between the rows in the cells. The results are compared in terms of theirmanufacturability and size. Ongoing work includes performance and power analysis on representative designs.", "Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) has become a critical toolset in navigating the tradeoffs between design targets and manufacturing constraints. Some methodologies for understanding these tradeoffs include 3D design rule validation, patterning optimization, design vs. manufacturing yield studies and fully-integrated process and electrical performance modeling. In this presentation, we will discuss how fully-integrated \u201cvirtual\u201d DTCO can be used to predict and ameliorate potential manufacturing and design issues prior to wafer-based testing. We will provide examples of how virtual DTCO can be used to predict optimal integration and patterning schemes, highlight areas of potential device failure, predict yield limiters, and gain a better understanding of how process variation can impact device performance. Our discussion will focus on process variation and parasitic impacts that are critical at 5nm and beyond, and we will share valuable insights learned from DTCO studies of next generation architectures.", "", "The talk presents pertinent surface chemistries required to achieve a highly anisotropic etch of metal absorbers for EUV masks, with the goal of realizing a nearly vertical sidewall angle of 90\u00ba. The selection of gas phase chemistries is crucial to the success of the patterning process, therefore the selection criteria, based on thermodynamic and kinetic assessment, will be explained. The general approach combines either reactive ion etching or ion beam etching with atomic layer etching processes where the sequential surface reactions starts with controlled surface modification, followed by selective removal of the modified layer. This general approach can be applied to a variety of EUV mask materials, making it possible to tackle more complex material systems as needed.", "Memory-hungry applications in the current data-driven economy demands DRAM devices with higher bit densities at a low cost. This demand has driven DRAM manufacturers to find innovative methods to extend Moore\u2019s scaling and reduce the area required to store individual bits. A DRAM unit memory cell is based on a one transistor one capacitor (1T1C) design. To increase DRAM densities, both transistor and capacitor must scale. As the capacitor diameter shrinks with scaling, the ratio of its height to its diameter--its aspect ratio (AR)--climbs quickly. This higher AR results in the need to produce relatively deeper holes to fabricate capacitors, increasing the demands on etch and deposition processes. In this paper, we present a solution to capacitor scaling by co-optimization of the hardmask and etch. The co-optimization involved novel deposition and etch techniques to enable continued scaling while maintaining device performance. We also discuss novel metrology methods that enable us to test and optimize the unit processes as well as the module-level integrated sequence.", "This paper describes how to overcome the challenges for EUV Lithography such as compatibility of performance, cost and defect reduction. The starting point application of innovative process technologies (e.g., high selectivity etching, atomic layer level control and so forth) to realize new booster technology in logic and memory. Post 5 nm co-optimization of novel film, etch and cleans technologies is critical to achieving cost effective process integration. However, fundamental advances in memory and logic still rely on dimensional controllability in high aspect patterns. A description of advances in these areas will round out the paper.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) has been adopted into high volume production for advanced logic device manufacturing. Due to the continuous size scaling requirement for interconnect fabrication, EUVL with self-aligned double patterning (SADP) formation has attracted substantial research attention [1]\u2013[6]. Double patterning techniques in EUVL achieve pitch halving in the final feature by using the spacer defined approach and self-aligned block (SAB) mitigates the block placement error by leveraging etch selectivities and material filling capability. The current challenge in EUV SADP is the pattern transfer process from lithography to mandrel formation. In this step, the target critical dimension (CD) of the feature needs to shrink by half from the lithography CD during the etch process. The increasing aspect ratio during this etch potentially deteriorates the pattern validity and the line edge roughness (LER) [5]. In addition to these challenges, EUVL has a fundamental bottleneck due to stochastic effects which can lead to device degradation by defect formation and edge-placement-error (EPE) [7]\u2013[10]. LER of the line and space pattern is one of the main contributors to EPE. Effective methods of LER reduction in both process and integration are needed in order to reduce pattern variation and boost device performance. In our research, we examine three approaches to reduce LER on the EUV SADP line pattern. This includes photoresist surface smoothing techniques, patterning layer material study, and tone inversion integration. The photoresist surface smoothing techniques involve a specific plasma process on the EUV chemical amplified resist (CAR) to achieve > 15% of improvement on LER from lithography to post etch performance. The patterning layer material study reveals an optimum patterning stack to minimize etch-induced line wiggling and etch selectivity requirements for LER performance. Finally, a first demonstration of EUV SADP tone inversion process integration is presented as a method to provide additional benefits to LER reduction. A detailed analysis of line performance from each processing step will be examined.", "As EUV direct patterning begins to hit its resolution limit, the need for EUV self-aligned double patterning (SADP) has arisen in order to reach sub-30 nm pitch. Currently, EUV resists suffer from several shortcomings, both in terms of roughness and resist budget. These constraints means using it directly as a mandrel material, as previously done for immersion lithography SADP is nearly impossible. Consequently, standard EUV SADP flows involve the transfer of the resist through a lithography stack and into a hard mandrel material, such as silicon nitride or amorphous silicon.1 Achieving line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) targets for an EUV SADP hard mandrel is significantly more challenging than for EUV direct print since the etch process needs to target a post etch CD of about half that of the lithographic CD. This aggressive shrink requirement usually involves degradation in roughness driven by high aspect ratios. To circumvent these issues, we have developed a new bottom up organic mandrel growth process, whereby the EUV resist can be grown to a height compatible with a resist mandrel SADP flow, while the roughness is improved and the critical dimension is controlled. This bottom up mandrel growth process is performed in an etch chamber and can therefore be easily coupled with other process steps. The mandrel height and critical dimensions can be easily tuned from the incoming lithography by changing the deposition and trim step times of the process. We have shown that this bottom-up grown mandrel can withstand typical ALD spacer process deposition. After spacer open, the organic material can be easily removed through an in-situ ash process before opening the underlayer. This integration will allow for the removal of the organic planarizing layer in the lithography stack, reducing the stack complexity, while also eliminating one of the major contributors to wiggling in the typical hard mandrel patterning scheme. In this paper, the performance of this new integration scheme was benchmarked against a more standard SADP flow. The roughness performance post mandrel formation and post spacer deposition for this new scheme is significantly improved over our standard EUV SADP baseline using a standard EUV SADP flow.", "3D NAND flash scaling relies mainly on increasing vertical stack height, thus putting challenges mostly on film deposition and etch. Among various fabrication steps, high aspect ratio (HAR) ONON channel hole etch remains the most critical step. One unique aspect of the 3D NAND process flow is that nitride film in the ONON pair is a sacrificial layer that is been replaced with W at a later stage. The SiN removal process flow provides opportunities to look at possibilities of optimizing oxide and nitride films at different layers to enable better channel hole etch, such as enlarging bottom hole CD, reducing bowing and twisting in the middle area, and etc. In this paper, we will highlight the approaches and benefits on deposition and etch co-optimization as one potential pathway to overcome barrier in HAR ONON channel hole patterning. Besides ONON HAR, hard mask is another key focus. We will also discuss the possible mask material selection consideration based the overall film properties, etch selectivity and final clean/removability perspectives.", "As contact dimensions continue to shrink to support scaling, local CD variation (LCDU) becomes a critical driver of electrical variation and defectivity. Continued logic scaling is highly dependent on middle of line (MOL), which further amplifies the need for LCDU improvement. LCDU improvement will be critical to improving edge placement error (EPE). The same concepts can also be applied to back end of line (BEOL) vias. Since lithography tools are unable to consistently print contacts below 20 nm, it is typically necessary to shrink through etch. There are various etch techniques we can use to shrink contact dimensions each having different impacts on LCDU and defectivity. In this study we explore the impacts of various shrink methods to optimize LCDU and defect density. In this study a simple patterning stack of SiN + OPL + ARC + resist is used to simulate contact patterning. Various etch chambers and shrink techniques are used to reach a target CD range and LCDU and defect density are evaluated. The chambers evaluated include TEL\u2019s conductor etcher and TEL\u2019s dielectric etcher. LCDU data is collected using CDSEM. Defect density is evaluated using various etch techniques. Etch techniques such as deposition on resist, ARC and OPL, descum steps, pulsing and quasi atomic layer etch are explored. Multiple types of deposition techniques are used including selective deposition and cyclic deposition and trim. These techniques are optimized to be sensitive to open area and correct for local CD variations. On wafer LCDU performance of <2.0nm is demonstrated and further optimization is done to minimize defectivity.", "EUV lithography is moving forward to high volume manufacturing in DRAM production to overcome technological challenges in cell scaling. While EUV is confronting its own challenges, DRAM cell design rules have been scaled down using multiple patterning to extend the use of 193nm immersion lithography beyond its optical resolution limits . One of the big challenges in advanced DRAM nodes is to maintain the capacitance requirement while shrinking the capacitor size. By transitioning from square to honeycomb layout, the industry enabled taller capacitor s with larger diameters [1]. Those structures are patterned using spacer based pitch splitting techniques, but multi-patterning processes for capacitors need to ensure a high density arrays of holes are formed without losing critical dimension (CD) uniformity within the misalignment budget. In this work, we will demonstrate how to scale down capacitor pitch under 40nm using spacer based pitch splitting of lines and space to create honeycomb structures. Different strategies of self-aligned double patterning and quadruple patterning techniques to form a dense array of holes will be discussed. Furthermore, we will investigate how anti-spacer technique can play a role in local CD uniformity and placement in the final pattern.", "3D and nanoscale dimensions make patterning extremely difficult to perform. In the past, patterning via plasma etching was a success thanks to the very good capacity of this process to etch one preferential material over the others: selective etching. Next step for advanced patterning will be to add a selective deposition step in addition to the etch one. Good examples are area selective deposition and topographical selective deposition. They will be discuss in this presentation", "Self-aligned contact (SAC) etch has been known to be challenging due to its limited process margin on Si3N4 to SiO2 etch selectivity. Understanding of surface modification during Quasi-ALE using fluorocarbon and Ar plasmas are essential to achieve atomic level control of etch pattern fidelity. In this paper, modeling techniques including first principal study, molecular dynamics simulation, chamber scale plasma simulation and Monte Carlo feature scale modeling have been incorporated to achieve physical demonstration of the Q-ALE process. Our study focuses on how the surface is modified by low energy ions followed by polymer accumulation by fluorocarbon neutrals at adsorption step under various plasma conditions to provide wide range of ion, radical densities with varied ion/radical ratios. Detailed surface evolvement including bonds, elements, structures, densities and depth information will be discussed with atomic level precision. In the Ar plasma desorption step, process dependence on ion energy angle distributions (IEADs) and ion fluxes has also been investigated. XPS surface analysis shows good agreement with modeling predictions. Modeling results and theories have reflected to process developments in next generation etchers with advanced pulsing, broad temperature control and other advanced features. Both blanket film etch rate and in-feature etch data will be discussed to validate the theoretical assumptions based on insights from modeling outputs. State of the art solutions with atomic level control and minimized nitride loss during SAC etch will be presented with in-depth fundamental understanding of correlations between innovative etch chamber designs and surface interactions.", "The ability to etch silicon highly anistropically at active fin heights of 45nm or greater is critical to fin patterning for continued CMOS scaling. Tight control of fin CD and taper is critical toward controlling the device, with particular importance to channel control. In this study we explore the quasi-atomic layer etch (qALE) parameter space in order to better understand the impact of plasma conditions on fin CD, profile, and aspect ratio dependent etch phenomena. A qALE solution is needed to provide a manufacturable solution for a vertical square bottom fin. In this study a cyclic chlorination (surface modification) + ion bombardment process (modified surface removal) is used to etch Si with a Si3N4 hard mask. Various parameters are explored including bias power, pressure, and time in the ion bombardment step as well as source power, pressure, and time in the chlorination step. With regards to the ion bombardment step, varying time helps to quantify the self-limitation of the etch process, modulating pressure helps to quantify the impact of reduced mean free path and ion density, and modifying source power helps to quantify the impact of changes to ion density. For the chlorination step, varying time helps to quantify the self-limitation of surface modification mechanism, and modifying source power illustrates the impact of Cl radical density on surface modification. These various mechanisms will be explored with the particular view point of how these changes can impact ultimate channel performance."], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
