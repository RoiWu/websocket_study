Significant efforts are put in to capitalize on the potential that DBO has to address measurement accuracy and robustness. Introduction of many measurement wavelength choices (continuous wavelength) in DBO is one of the key new capabilities in this area. Along with the continuous choice of wavelengths, the algorithms (fueled by swing-curve physics) on how to use these wavelengths are of high importance for a robust recipe setup that can avoid the impact from process stack variations (symmetric as well as asymmetric). All these are discussed. Moreover, another aspect of boosting measurement accuracy and robustness is discussed that deploys the capability to combine overlay measurement data from multiple wavelength measurements. The goal is to provide a method to make overlay measurements immune from process stack variations and also to report health KPIs for every measurement. By combining measurements from multiple wavelengths, a final overlay measurement is generated. The results show a significant benefit in accuracy and robustness against process stack variation. These results are supported by both measurement data as well as simulation from many product stacks.", "Advanced processing methods like multiple patterning necessitate improved intra-layer uniformity and balancing monitoring for overlay and CD. To achieve those requirements without major throughout impact, a new advanced mark for measurement is introduced. Based on an optical measurement, this mark delivers CD and overlay results for a specified layer at once. During the conducted experiments at front-end-of-line (FEOL) process area, a mark selection is done and the measurement capability of this mark design is verified. Gathered results are used to determine lithography to etch biases and intra-wafer signatures for CD and overlay. Furthermore, possible use cases like dose correction recipe creation and process signature monitoring were discussed.", "In next generation Logic devices, overlay control requirements shrink to sub 2.5nm level on-product overlay. Historically on-product overlay has been defined by the overlay capability of after-develop in-scribe targets. However, due to design and dimension, the after development metrology targets are not completely representative for the final overlay of the device. In addition, they are confined to the scribe-lane area, which limits the sampling possibilities. To address these two issues, metrology on structures matching the device structure and which can be sampled with high density across the device is required. Conventional after-etch CDSEM techniques on logic devices present difficulties in discerning the layers of interest, potential destructive charging effects and finally, they are limited by the long measurement times[1] [2] [3] . All together, limit the sampling densities and making CDSEM less attractive for control applications. Optical metrology can overcome most of these limitations. Such measurement, however, does require repetitive structures. This requirement is not fulfilled by logic devices, as the features vary in pitch and CD over the exposure field. The solution is to use small targets, with a maximum pad size of 5x5um2 , which can easily be placed in the logic cell area. These targets share the process and architecture of the device features of interest, but with a modified design that replicates as close as possible the device layout, allowing for in-device metrology for both CD and Overlay. This solution enables measuring closer to the actual product feature location and, not being limited to scribe-lanes, it opens the possibility of higher-density sampling schemes across the field. In summary, these targets become the facilitator of in-device metrology (IDM), that is, enabling the measurements both in-device Overlay and the CD parameters of interest and can deliver accurate, high-throughput, dense and after-etch measurements for Logic. Overlay improvements derived from a high-densely sampled Overlay map measured with 5x5 um2 In Device Metrology (IDM) targets were investigated on a customer Logic application. In this work we present both the main design aspects of the 5x5 um2 IDM targets, as well as the results on the improved Overlay performance.", "In semiconductor industry, fast and effective measurement of pattern variation has been key challenge for assuring massproduct quality. Pattern measurement techniques such as conventional CD-SEMs or Optical CDs have been extensively used, but these techniques are increasingly limited in terms of measurement throughput and time spent in modeling. In this paper we propose time effective pattern monitoring method through the direct spectrum-based approach. In this technique, a wavelength band sensitive to a specific pattern change is selected from spectroscopic ellipsometry signal scattered by pattern to be measured, and the amplitude and phase variation in the wavelength band are analyzed as a measurement index of the pattern change. This pattern change measurement technique is applied to several process steps and verified its applicability. Due to its fast and simple analysis, the methods can be adapted to the massive process variation monitoring maximizing measurement throughput.", "Power spectral density (PSD) analysis is playing more and more a critical role in the understanding of line-edge roughness (LER) and linewidth roughness (LWR) in a variety of applications across the industry. It is an essential step to get an unbiased LWR estimate, as well as an extremely useful tool for process and material characterization. However, PSD estimate can be affected by both random to systematic artifacts caused by image acquisition and measurement settings, which could irremediably alter its information content. In this paper, we report on the impact of various setting parameters (smoothing image processing filters, pixel size, and SEM noise levels) on the PSD estimate. We discuss also the use of PSD analysis tool in a variety of cases. Looking beyond the basic roughness estimate, we use PSD and autocorrelation analysis to characterize resist blur[1], as well as low and high frequency roughness contents and we apply this technique to guide the EUV material stack selection. Our results clearly indicate that, if properly used, PSD methodology is a very sensitive tool to investigate material and process variations", "In this paper, we discuss the metrology methods and error budget that describe the edge placement error (EPE). EPE quantifies the pattern fidelity of a device structure made in a multi-patterning scheme. Here the pattern is the result of a sequence of lithography and etching steps, and consequently the contour of the final pattern contains error sources of the different process steps. EPE is computed by combining optical and ebeam metrology data. We show that high NA optical scatterometer can be used to densely measure in device CD and overlay errors. Large field e-beam system enables massive CD metrology which is used to characterize the local CD error. Local CD distribution needs to be characterized beyond 6 sigma, and requires high throughput e-beam system. We present in this paper the first images of a multi-beam e-beam inspection system. We discuss our holistic patterning optimization approach to understand and minimize the EPE of the final pattern. As a use case, we evaluated a 5-nm logic patterning process based on Self-Aligned-QuadruplePatterning (SAQP) using ArF lithography, combined with line cut exposures using EUV lithography.", "In addition to lithography process and equipment induced variations, processes like etching, annealing, film deposition and planarization exhibit variations, each having their own intrinsic characteristics and leaving an effect, a \u2018fingerprint\u2019, on the wafers. With ever tighter requirements for CD and overlay, controlling these process induced variations is both increasingly important and increasingly challenging in advanced integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing. For example, the on-product overlay (OPO) requirement for future nodes is approaching <3nm, requiring the allowable budget for process induced variance to become extremely small. Process variance control is seen as an bottleneck to further shrink which drives the need for more sophisticated process control strategies. In this context we developed a novel \u2018computational process control strategy\u2019 which provides the capability of proactive control of each individual wafer with aim to maximize the yield, without introducing a significant impact on metrology requirements, cycle time or productivity. The complexity of the wafer process is approached by characterizing the full wafer stack building a fingerprint library containing key patterning performance parameters like Overlay, Focus, etc. Historical wafer metrology is decomposed into dominant fingerprints using Principal Component Analysis. By associating observed fingerprints with their origin e.g. process steps, tools and variables, we can give an inline assessment of the strength and origin of the fingerprints on every wafer. Once the fingerprint library is established, a wafer specific fingerprint correction recipes can be determined based on its processing history. Data science techniques are used in real-time to ensure that the library is adaptive. To realize this concept, ASML TWINSCAN scanners play a vital role with their on-board full wafer detection and exposure correction capabilities. High density metrology data is created by the scanner for each wafer and on every layer during the lithography steps. This metrology data will be used to obtain the process fingerprints. Also, the per exposure and per wafer correction potential of the scanners will be utilized for improved patterning control. Additionally, the fingerprint library will provide early detection of excursions for inline root cause analysis and process optimization guidance.", "Immersion lithography is being extended beyond the 10-nm node and the lithography performance requirement needs to be tightened further to ensure good yield. Amongst others, good on-product focus control with accurate and dense metrology measurements is essential to enable this. In this paper, we will present new solutions that enable onproduct focus monitoring and control (mean and uniformity) suitable for high volume manufacturing environment. We will introduce the concept of pure focus and its role in focus control through the imaging optimizer scanner correction interface. The results will show that the focus uniformity can be improved by up to 25%.", "Computational metrology has been proposed as the way forward to resolve the need for increased metrology density, resulting from extending correction capabilities, without adding actual metrology budget. By exploiting TWINSCAN based metrology information, dense overlay fingerprints for every wafer can be computed. This extended metrology dataset enables new use cases, such as monitoring and control based on fingerprints for every wafer of the lot. This paper gives a detailed description, discusses the accuracy of the fingerprints computed, and will show results obtained in a DRAM HVM manufacturing environment. Also an outlook for improvements and extensions will be shared.", "It is getting more important to monitor all aspects of influencing parameters in critical etch steps and utilize them as tuning knobs for within-wafer uniformity improvement and wafer edge yield enhancement. Meanwhile, we took a dive in pursuing \u201cmeasuring what matters\u201d and challenged ourselves for more aspects of signals acquired in actual process conditions. Among these factors which are considered subtle previously, we identified Temperature, especially electrostatic chuck (ESC) Temperature measurement in real etch process conditions have direct correlation to in-line measurements. In this work, we used SensArray technique (EtchTemp-SE wafer) to measure ESC temperature profile on a 300mm wafer with plasma turning on to reproduce actual temperature pattern on wafers in real production process conditions. In field applications, we observed substantial correlation between ESC temperature and in-line optical metrology measurements and since temperature is a process factor that can be tuning through set-temperature modulations, we have identified process knobs with known impact on physical profile variations. Furthermore, ESC temperature profile on a 300mm wafer is configured as multiple zones upon radius and SensArray measurements mechanism could catch such zonal distribution as well, which enables detailed temperature modulations targeting edge ring only where most of chips can be harvested and critical zone for yield enhancement. Last but not least, compared with control reference (ESC Temperature in static plasma-off status), we also get additional factors to investigate in chamber-to-chamber matching study and make process tool fleet match on the basis really matters in production. KLA-Tencor EtchTemp-SE wafer enables Plasma On wafer temperature monitoring of silicon etch process. This wafer is wireless and has 65 sensors with measurement range from 20 to 140\u00b0C. the wafer is designed to run in real production recipe plasma on condition with maximum RF power up to 7KW. The wafer surface is coated with Yttrium oxide film which allows Silicon Etch chemistry. At Fab-8, we carried investigations in 14 nm FEOL critical etch process which has direct impact on yield, using SensorArray EtchTemp-SE wafer, we measured ESC temperature profile across multiple chambers, for both plasma on and plasma off, promising results achieved on chamber temperature signature identification, guideline for chamber to chamber matching improvement. Correlation between wafer mean temperature and determining criticality-process parameters of recess depth and CD is observed. Furthermore, detail zonal temperature/profile correlation is investigated to identify individual correlation in each chuck zone, and provided unique process knobs corresponding to each chunk. Meanwhile, passive ESC Chuck DOE was done to modulate wafer temperature at different zones, and Sensor Array wafer measurements verified temperature responding well with the ESC set point. Correlation R2 = 0.9979 for outer ring and R2 = 0.9981 for Mid Outer ring is observed, as shown in . Experiments planning to modulate edge zone ESC temperature to tune profile within-wafer uniformity and prove gain in edge yield enhancement and to improve edge yield is underway.", "Before each wafer exposure, the photo lithography scanner\u2019s alignment system measures alignment marks to correct for placement errors and wafer deformation. To minimize throughput impact, the number of alignment measurements is limited. Usually, the wafer alignment does not correct for intrafield effects. However, after calibration of lens and reticle heating, residual heating effects remain. A set of wafers is exposed with special reticles containing many alignment marks, enabling intra-field alignment. Reticles with a dense alignment layout have been used, with different defined intra-field bias. In addition, overlay simulations are performed with dedicated higher order intra-field overlay models to compensate for wafer-to-wafer and across-wafer heating.", "A machine-learning model is presented that effectively partitions historical process data into outlier and inlier subpopulations. This is necessary in order to avoid using outlier data to build a model for detecting process instability. Exact control limits are given without recourse to approximations and the error characteristics of the control model are derived. A worked example for contamination control is presented along with the machine learning algorithm used and all the programming statements needed for implementation.", "Overlay errors between two layers can be caused by non-lithography processes. While these errors can be compensated by the run-to-run system, such process and tool signatures are not always stable. In order to monitor the impact of non-lithography context on overlay at regular intervals, a systematic approach is needed. Using various machine learning techniques, significant context parameters that relate to deviating overlay signatures are automatically identified. Once the most influential context parameters are found, a run-to-run simulation is performed to see how much improvement can be obtained. The resulting analysis shows good potential for reducing the influence of hidden context parameters on overlay performance. Non-lithographic contexts are significant contributors, and their automatic detection and classification will enable the overlay roadmap, given the corresponding control capabilities.", "Mask registration data are presented, which demonstrate local errors that can be correlated to writing swathes of state-of-the-art e-beam writers and multi-pass strategies. A unique measurement methodology, Local Registration Metrology, allows for dense sampling of reticle dies to characterize the local e-beam registration error and enables e-beam corrections via feed forward.", "Recently, a novel method for the calculation of unbiased Line Edge Roughness based on Power Spectral Density analysis has been proposed. In this paper first an alternative method is discussed and investigated, utilizing the Height-Height Correlation Function (HHCF) of edges. The HHCF-based method enables the unbiased determination of the whole triplet of LER parameters including besides rms the correlation length and roughness exponent. The key of both methods is the sensitivity of PSD and HHCF on noise at high frequencies and short distance respectively. Secondly, we elaborate a testbed of synthesized SEM images with controlled LER and noise to justify the effectiveness of the proposed unbiased methods. Our main objective is to find out the boundaries of the method in respect to noise levels and roughness characteristics, for which the method remains reliable, i.e the maximum amount of noise allowed, for which the output results cope with the controllable known inputs. At the same time, we will also set the extremes of roughness parameters for which the methods hold their accuracy.", "General approaches to realize higher sensitivity in optical inspection system are using shorter wavelength including UV and higher NA for objective lens. Extreme performances of imaging and illumination systems in a situation of wellmatched to each other are inevitable for the further effort on an effective optical detection of fine defects in patterned wafer. This study focused on the dark-field illumination method in near-field condition with simple modification of far-field imaging and illumination system which is designed by anamorphic optics and the potential of it is derived from experimental methods.", "Recently the aspect ratio of capacitor and via hole of memory semiconductor device has been dramatically increasing in order to store more information in a limited area. A small amount of remained residues after etch process on the bottom of the high aspect ratio structure can make a critical failure in device operation. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are mainly used for inspecting the defect located at the bottom of the high aspect ratio structure or analyzing the overlay of the multi-layer structure because these electrons have a high linearity with the direction of emission and a high kinetic energy above 50eV. However, there is a limitation on that it cannot detect ultra-thin residue material having a thickness of several nanometers because the surface sensitivity is extremely low. We studied the characteristics of BSE spectra using Monte Carlo simulations for several cases which the high aspect ratio structures have extreme microscopic residues. Based on the assumption that most of the electrons emitted without energy loss are localized on the surface, we selected the detection energy window which has a range of 20eV below the maximum energy of the BSE. This window section is named as the high-energy BSE region. As a result of comparing the detection sensitivity of the conventional and the high-energy BSE detection mode, we found that the detection sensitivity for the residuals which have 2nm thickness is improved by more than 10 times in the high-energy BSE mode. This BSE technology is a new inspection method that can greatly be improved the inspection sensitivity for the ultra-thin residual material presented in the high aspect ratio structure, and its application will be expanded.", "Accurate EPE (edge placement error) characterization is important for the process control of high-volume manufacturing at N5 BEOL and beyond. In a CD-SEM metrology, the accurate edge-to-edge measurements among multiple layers and/or SEM-Contour extraction are required for the accurate EPE characterization. One of the technical challenges in CD-SEM metrology is to control charging effects caused by EB-irradiation during SEM image acquisition. In this paper, the effects of new charge control methods (Special Scan and Faster Scan), which are implemented in the latest Hitachi CD-SEM (CG6300), were examined with EUV resist hole-patterns. It was confirmed that Special Scan showed a profound effect on the suppression of the charge-induced errors. We also demonstrated the effects of the Special Scan for CD measurements and Contour Extraction for the EPE characterization of block on SAQP (SAQP lines + EUV block) pattern at imec iN7platform. Consequently, Special Scan is expected to be the solution for the accurate EPE measurements by CD-SEM.", "Edge placement error (EPE) has become an increasingly critical metric to enable Moore\u2019s Law scaling. Stochastic variations, as characterized for lines by line width roughness (LWR) and line edge roughness (LER), are dominant factors in EPE and known to increase with the introduction of EUV lithography. However, despite recommendations from ITRS, NIST, and SEMI standards, the industry has not agreed upon a methodology to quantify these properties. Thus, differing methodologies applied to the same image often result in different roughness measurements and conclusions. To standardize LWR and LER measurements, Fractilia has developed an unbiased measurement that uses a raw unfiltered line scan to subtract out image noise and distortions. By using Fractilia\u2019s inverse linescan model (FILM) to guide development, we will highlight the key influences of roughness metrology on plasma-based resist smoothing processes. Test wafers were deposited to represent a 5 nm node EUV logic stack. The patterning stack consists of a core Si target layer with spin-on carbon (SOC) as the hardmask and spin-on glass (SOG) as the cap. Next, these wafers were exposed through an ASML NXE 3350B EUV scanner with an advanced chemically amplified resist (CAR). Afterwards, these wafers were etched through a variety of plasma-based resist smoothing techniques using a Lam Kiyo conductor etch system. Dense line and space patterns on the etched samples were imaged through advanced Hitachi CDSEMs and the LER and LWR were measured through both Fractilia and an industry standard roughness measurement software. By employing Fractilia to guide plasma-based etch development, we demonstrate that Fractilia produces accurate roughness measurements on resist in contrast to an industry standard measurement software. These results highlight the importance of subtracting out SEM image noise to obtain quicker developmental cycle times and lower target layer roughness.", "We present an experimental study of pattern variability and defectivity, based on a large data set with more than 112 million SEM measurements from an HMI high-throughput e-beam tool. The test case is a 10nm node SRAM via array patterned with a DUV immersion LELE process, where we see a variation in mean size and litho sensitivities between different unique via patterns that leads to a seemingly qualitative differences in defectivity. The large available data volume enables further analysis to reliably distinguish global and local CDU variations, including a breakdown into local systematics and stochastics. A closer inspection of the tail end of the distributions and estimation of defect probabilities concludes that there is a common defect mechanism and defect threshold despite the observed differences of specific pattern characteristics. We expect that the analysis methodology can be applied for defect probability modeling as well as general process qualification in the future.", "For EUV lithography features we want to decrease the dose and/or energy of CD-SEM\u2019s probe beam because LER decreases with severe resist-material\u2019s shrink. Under such conditions, however, measured LER increases from true LER, due to LER bias that is fake LER caused by random noise in SEM image. A gap error occurs between the right and the left LERs. In this work we propose new procedures to obtain true LER by excluding the LER bias from the measured LER. To verify it we propose a LER\u2019s reference-metrology using TEM.", "With the increase of litho-etch steps the industry requires metrology to deliver solutions to improve throughput of overlay measurements without impacting accuracy. ASML\u2019s YieldStar 350E is capable of utilizing targets, which can measure the overlay of multiple layers simultaneously. For the work discussed in this paper, an evaluation is performed on Logic product wafers using both single-layer and multi-layer (MLT) quad type targets (able to capture up to four litho-etch steps). Different target types were compared in terms of Move-and-Acquire (MA) time, residual and matching to SEM. Using the MLT targets, an MA time improvement of 56% was demonstrated on the singlelayer. The maximum delta between the overlay residual among the YieldStar targets after applying an high order model was shown to be 0.05 nm. In comparison to after-etch overlay, the correlation of the MLT target was determined with an R2 >; 0.95 using a set-get wafer with induced 10 nm overlay range. On a normal production wafer, the correlation was R2 > 0.67, which is high on a wafer without induced overlay. The comparison of modeling parameters between SEM and MLT targets shows a good match (< 0.16nm) as well.", "In the discussion of edge placement error (EPE), we proposed interactive pattern fidelity error (IPFE) as an indicator to judge pass/fail of integrated patterns. IPFE consists of lower and upper layer EPEs (CD and center of gravity: COG) and overlay, which is decided from the combination of each maximum variation. We succeeded in obtaining the IPFE density function by Monte Carlo simulation. In the results, we also found that the standard deviation (\u03c3) of each indicator should be controlled by 4.0\u03c3, at the semiconductor grade, such as 100 billion patterns per die. Moreover, CD, COG and overlay were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA); we can discuss all variations from wafer to wafer (WTW), pattern to pattern (PTP), line edge roughness (LWR) and stochastic pattern noise (SPN) on an equal footing. From the analysis results, we can determine that these variations belong to which process and tools. Furthermore, measurement length of LWR is also discussed in ANOVA. We propose that the measurement length for IPFE analysis should not be decided to the micro meter order, such as >2 \u03bcm length, but for which device is actually desired.", "Lithography process control solutions require more exacting capabilities as the semiconductor industry goes forward to the 1x nm node DRAM device manufacturing. In order to continue scaling down the device feature sizes, critical dimension (CD) uniformity requires continuous improvement to meet the required CD error budget. In this study we investigate using optical measurement technology to improve over CD-SEM methods in focus, dose, and CD. One of the key challenges is measuring scanner focus of device patterns. There are focus measurement methods based on specially designed marks on scribe-line, however, one issue of this approach is that it will report focus of scribe line which is potentially different from that of the real device pattern. In addition, scribe-line marks require additional design and troubleshooting steps that add complexity. In this study, we investigated focus measurement directly on the device pattern. Dose control is typically based on using the linear correlation behavior between dose and CD. The noise of CD measurement, based on CD-SEM for example, will not only impact the accuracy, but also will make it difficult to monitor dose signature on product wafers. In this study we will report the direct dose metrology result using an optical metrology system which especially enhances the DUV spectral coverage to improve the signal to noise ratio. CD-SEM is often used to measure CD after the lithography step. This measurement approach has the advantage of easy recipe setup as well as the flexibility to measure critical feature dimensions, however, we observe that CD-SEM metrology has limitations. In this study, we demonstrate within-field CD uniformity improvement through the extraction of clean scanner slit and scan CD behavior by using optical metrology.", "To reduce charging and shrinkage, CD-SEMs utilize low electron energies and multiframe imaging. This results in every next frame being altered due to stage and beam instability, as well as due to charging. Regular averaging of the frames blurs the edges; this directly effects the extracted values of critical dimensions. A technique was developed to overlay multiframe images without the loss of quality. This method takes into account drift, rotation, and magnification corrections, as well as nonlinear distortions due to wafer charging. A significant improvement in the signal to noise ratio and overall image quality without degradation of the feature\u2019s edge quality was achieved. The developed software is capable of working with regular and large size images up to 32K pixels in each direction.", "Dual damascene is an established patterning process for back-end-of-line to generate copper interconnects and lines. One of the critical output parameters is the electrical resistance of the metal lines. In our 200 mm line, this is currently being controlled by a feed-forward control from the etch process to the final step in the CMP process. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alternative feed-forward control using a calibrated physical model that estimates the impact on electrical resistance of the metal lines* . This is done by simulation on a large set of wafers. Three different approaches are evaluated, one of which uses different feed-forward settings for different radial zones in the CMP process.", "We report on advanced defect classification using TNO\u2019s RapidNano particle scanner. RapidNano was originally designed for defect detection on blank substrates. In detection-mode, the RapidNano signal from nine azimuth angles is added for sensitivity. In review-mode signals from individual angles are analyzed to derive additional defect properties. We define the Fourier coefficient parameter space that is useful to study the statistical variation in defect types on a sample. By selecting defects from each defect type for further review by SEM, information on all defects can be obtained efficiently.", "We have been developing a charging simulator \u201cCHARMs\u201d, which is based on 3D finite element method, to predict the characteristics of signal from charged pattern on surface of semi-conductor during the SEM observation. We have constructed a new flexible model to simulate the in-solid electron scattering by the Langevin equation for \u201cCHARMs\u201d. Our new model can manipulate the size of the diffusion cloud of scattering electron by the parameters of it and calculate ten times faster than the conventional Monte Carlo (MC) method. In addition to that, the model has the possibility to accurately describe the scattering of low energy electron. We also confirmed that the same results of the conventional MC method can be obtained from the simulation model of metal pattern buried in the sample.", "As design pitch shrinks to the resolution limit of up-to-date optical lithography technology, the Critical Dimension (CD) variation tolerance has been dramatically decreased for ensuring the functionality of device. One of critical challenges associates with the narrower CD tolerance for whole chip area is the proximity effect control on asymmetrical layout environments. To fulfill the tight CD control of complex features, the Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope (CD-SEM) based measurement results for qualifying process window and establishing the Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) model become insufficient, thus 2D contour extraction technique [1-5] has been an increasingly important approach for complementing the insufficiencies of traditional CD measurement algorithm. To alleviate the long cycle time and high cost penalties for product verification, manufacturing requirements are better to be well handled at design stage to improve the quality and yield of ICs. In this work, in-house 2D contour extraction platform was established for layout design optimization of 39nm half-pitch Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) process layer. Combining with the adoption of Process Variation Band Index (PVBI), the contour extraction platform enables layout optimization speedup as comparing to traditional methods. The capabilities of identifying and handling lithography hotspots in complex layout environments of 2D contour extraction platform allow process window aware layout optimization to meet the manufacturing requirements.", "In the last decades the semiconductor technology has been driven by Moore\u2019s law leading to high performance CMOS technologies with feature sizes of less than 10 nm [1]. It has been pointed out that not only scaling but also the integration of novel components and technology modules into CMOS/BiCMOS technologies is becoming more attractive to realize smart and miniaturized systems [2]. Driven by new applications in the area of communication, health and automation, new components and technology modules such as BiCMOS embedded RF-MEMS, high-Q passives, Sibased microfluidics and InP-SiGe BiCMOS heterointegration have been demonstrated [3-6]. In contrast to standard VLSI processes fabricated on front side of the silicon wafer, these new technology modules additionally require to process the backside of the wafer; thus require an accurate alignment between the front and backside of the wafer. In previous work an advanced back to front side alignment technique and implementation into IHP\u2019s 0.25/0.13 \u00b5m high performance SiGe:C BiCMOS backside process module has been presented [7]. The developed technique enables a high resolution and accurate lithography on the backside of BiCMOS wafer for additional backside processing. In addition to the aforementioned back side process technologies, new applications like Through-Silicon Vias (TSV) for interposers and advanced substrate technologies for 3D heterogeneous integration demand not only single wafer fabrication but also processing of wafer stacks provided by temporary and permanent wafer bonding [8-9]. In this work, the non-contact infrared alignment system of the Nikon\u00ae i-line Stepper NSR-SF150 for both alignment and the overlay determination of bonded wafer stacks with embedded alignment marks are used to achieve an accurate alignment between the different wafer sides. The embedded field image alignment (FIA) marks of the interface and the device wafer top layer are measured in a single measurement job. By taking the offsets between all different FIA\u2019s into account, after correcting the wafer rotation induced FIA position errors, hence an overlay for the stacked wafers can be determined. The developed approach has been validated by a standard front side resist in resist experiment. After the successful validation of the developed technique, special wafer stacks with FIA alignment marks in the bonding interface are fabricated and exposed. Following overlay calculation shows an overlay of less than 200 nm, which enables very accurate process condition for highly scaled TSV integration and advanced substrate integration into IHP\u2019s 0.25/0.13 \u00b5m SiGe:C BiCMOS technology. The developed technique also allows using significantly smaller alignment marks (i.e. standard FIA alignment marks). Furthermore, the presented method is used, in case of wafer bow related overlay tool problems, for the overlay evaluation of the last two metal layers from production wafers prepared in IHP\u2019s standard 0.25/0.13 \u00b5m SiGe:C BiCMOS technology. In conclusion, the exposure and measurement job can be done with the same tool, minimizing the back to front side/interface top layer misalignment which leads to a significant device performance improvement of backside/TSV integrated components and technologies.", "In fabrication, overlay measurements of semiconductor device patterns have conventionally been performed using optical methods. Beginning with image-based techniques using box-in-box to the more recent diffraction-based overlay (DBO). Alternatively, use of SEM overlay is under consideration for in-device overlay. Two main application spaces are measurement features from multiple mask levels on the same surface and buried features. Modern CD-SEMs are adept at measuring overlay for cases where all features are on the surface. In order to measure overlay of buried features, HV-SEM is needed. Gate-to-fin and BEOL overlay are important use cases for this technique. A JMONSEL simulation exercise was performed for these two cases using 10 nm line/space gratings of graduated increase in depth of burial. Backscattered energy loss results of these simulations were used to calculate the sensitivity measurements of buried features versus electron dosage for an array of electron beam voltages.", "We present preliminary through-pellicle imaging using a 30nm tabletop extreme ultraviolet (EUV) coherent diffractive imaging microscope. We show that even in a non-optimized setup, this technique enables through-pellicle imaging of a sample with no detectable impact on image fidelity or resolution.", "Classical SEM metrology, CD-SEM, uses low data rate and extensive frame-averaging technique to achieve high-quality SEM imaging for high-precision metrology. The drawbacks include prolonged data collection time and larger photoresist shrinkage due to excess electron dosage. This paper will introduce a novel e-beam metrology system based on a high data rate, large probe current, and ultra-low noise electron optics design. At the same level of metrology precision, this high speed e-beam metrology system could significantly shorten data collection time and reduce electron dosage. In this work, the data collection speed is higher than 7,000 images per hr. Moreover, a novel large field of view (LFOV) capability at high resolution was enabled by an advanced electron deflection system design. The area coverage by LFOV is >100x larger than classical SEM. Superior metrology precision throughout the whole image has been achieved, and high quality metrology data could be extracted from full field. This new capability on metrology will further improve metrology data collection speed to support the need for large volume of metrology data from OPC model calibration of next generation technology. The shrinking EPE (Edge Placement Error) budget places more stringent requirement on OPC model accuracy, which is increasingly limited by metrology errors. In the current practice of metrology data collection and data processing to model calibration flow, CD-SEM throughput becomes a bottleneck that limits the amount of metrology measurements available for OPC model calibration, impacting pattern coverage and model accuracy especially for 2D pattern prediction. To address the trade-off in metrology sampling and model accuracy constrained by the cycle time requirement, this paper employs the high speed e-beam metrology system and a new computational software solution to take full advantage of the large volume data and significantly reduce both systematic and random metrology errors. The new computational software enables users to generate large quantity of highly accurate EP (Edge Placement) gauges and significantly improve design pattern coverage with up to 5X gain in model prediction accuracy on complex 2D patterns. Overall, this work showed >2x improvement in OPC model accuracy at a faster model turn-around time.", "Cutting edge innovation requires accurate and fast process-control to obtain fast learning rate and industry adoption. Current tools available for such task are mainly manual and user dependent. We present in this paper cognitive learning, which is a new machine learning based technique to facilitate and to speed up complex characterization by using the design as input, providing fast training and detection time. We will focus on the machine learning framework that allows object detection, defect traceability and automatic measurement tools.", "A new metrology method of quantitatively measuring wiggling patterns in a Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) process for 2D NAND technology has been developed with a CD-SEM metrology program on images from a Review-SEM system. The metrology program provided accurate modeling of various wiggling patterns. The Review-SEM system provided a-few-micrometer-wide Field of View (FOV), which exceeds precision-guaranteed FOV of a conventional CD-SEM. The result has been effectively verified by visual inspection on vertically compressed images compared with Wiggling Index from this new method. A best-known method (BKM) system has been developed with connected HW and SW to automatically measure wiggling patterns.", "In a 200 mm high volume environment, we studied data from a dual damascene process. Dual damascene is a combination of lithography, etch and CMP that is used to create copper lines and contacts in one single step. During these process steps, different metal CD are measured by different measurement methods. In this study, we analyze the key numbers of the different measurements after different process steps and develop simple models to predict the electrical behavior* . In addition, radial profiles have been analyzed of both inline measurement parameters and electrical parameters. A matching method was developed based on inline and electrical data. Finally, correlation analysis for radial signatures is presented that can be used to predict excursions in electrical signatures.", "As the feature size is shrinking in the foundries, the need for inline high resolution surface profiling with versatile capabilities is increasing. One of the important areas of this need is chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process. We introduce a new generation of atomic force profiler (AFP) using decoupled scanners design. The system is capable of providing small-scale profiling using XY scanner and large-scale profiling using sliding stage. Decoupled scanners design enables enhanced vision which helps minimizing the positioning error for locations of interest in case of highly polished dies. Non-Contact mode imaging is another feature of interest in this system which is used for surface roughness measurement, automatic defect review, and deep trench measurement. Examples of the measurements performed using the atomic force profiler are demonstrated.", "Severe process margin in advanced technology node of semiconductor device is controlled by e-beam metrology system and e-beam inspection system with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image. By using SEM, larger area image with higher image quality is required to collect massive amount of data for metrology and to detect defect in a large area for inspection. Although photoresist is the one of the critical process in semiconductor device manufacturing, observing photoresist pattern by SEM image is crucial and troublesome especially in the case of large image. The charging effect by e-beam irradiation on photoresist pattern causes deterioration of image quality, and it affect CD variation on metrology system and causes difficulties to continue defect inspection in a long time for a large area. In this study, we established a quantitative approach for optimizing e-beam condition with \u201cDie to Database\u201d algorithm of NGR3500 on photoresist pattern to minimize charging effect. And we enhanced the performance of measurement and inspection on photoresist pattern by using optimized e-beam condition. NGR3500 is the geometry verification system based on \u201cDie to Database\u201d algorithm which compares SEM image with design data [1]. By comparing SEM image and design data, key performance indicator (KPI) of SEM image such as \"Sharpness\", \"S/N\", \"Gray level variation in FOV\", \"Image shift\" can be retrieved. These KPIs were analyzed with different e-beam conditions which consist of \u201cLanding Energy\u201d, \u201cProbe Current\u201d, \u201cScanning Speed\u201d and \u201cScanning Method\u201d, and the best e-beam condition could be achieved with maximum image quality, maximum scanning speed and minimum image shift. On this quantitative approach of optimizing e-beam condition, we could observe dependency of SEM condition on photoresist charging. By using optimized e-beam condition, measurement could be continued on photoresist pattern over 24 hours stably. KPIs of SEM image proved image quality during measurement and inspection was stabled enough.", "New materials and designs in complex 3D architectures in logic and memory devices have raised complexity in S/TEM metrology. In this paper, we report about a newly developed, automated, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) based, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) metrology method that addresses these challenges. Different methodologies toward repeatable and efficient, automated STEM-EDS metrology with high throughput are presented: we introduce the best known auto-EDS acquisition and quantification methods for robust and reliable metrology and present how electron exposure dose impacts the EDS metrology reproducibility, either due to poor signalto-noise ratio (SNR) at low dose or due to sample modifications at high dose conditions. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the STEM-EDS metrology technique and propose strategies to optimize the process both in terms of throughput and metrology reliability.", "Defects in ultra-thin films appear as small perturbations in the measured optical dispersion using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). A common approach for quantifying these defects is to fit each pixel in the dispersion to an index of refraction and extinction coefficient for a known material thickness (point-by-point method). However, this point-bypoint method is not physical because it produces dispersions that are not Kramers-Kronig consistent and it is also subject to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that the Kramers-Kronig consistent Cody Lorentz Multiple-Oscillator model (CLM) can precisely quantify defects in HfO2 using the Lorentz peak amplitude dispersion parameter as one of the fitting parameters. Using a KLA-Tencor spectroscopic ellipsometer, we collected optical dispersions of ultra-thin HfO2 grown on SiO2 for a variety of growth parameters including HfO2 thickness, SiO2 thickness, and anneal time, and then have used CLM to quantify the defects. The HfO2 defect value was found to successfully track the different growth conditions, which is consistent with literature, and the defect values have little within-wafer variance. Quantifying defects in a material sub-bandgap successfully will provide information about leakage currents and device performance for gated semiconductor devices.", "One of the main components of an On-Product Overlay (OPO) error budget is the process induced wafer error. This necessitates wafer-to-wafer correction in order to optimize overlay accuracy. This paper introduces the Litho Booster (LB), standalone alignment station as a solution to improving OPO. LB can execute high speed alignment measurements without throughput (THP) loss. LB can be installed in any lithography process control loop as a metrology tool, and is then able to provide feed-forward (FF) corrections to the scanners. In this paper, the detailed LB design is described and basic LB performance and OPO improvement is demonstrated. Litho Booster\u2019s extendibility and applicability as a solution for next generation manufacturing accuracy and productivity challenges are also outlined", "Over the years, mask and wafers defects dispositioning has become an increasingly challenging and time consuming task. With design rules getting smaller, OPC getting complex and scanner illumination taking on free-form shapes - the probability of a user to perform accurate and repeatable classification of defects detected by mask inspection tools into pass/fail bins is reducing. The critical challenging of mask defect metrology for small nodes ( < 30 nm) was reviewed in [1]. While Critical Dimension (CD) variation measurement is still the method of choice for determining a mask defect future impact on wafer, the high complexity of OPCs combined with high variability in pattern shapes poses a challenge for any automated CD variation measurement method. In this study, a novel approach for measurement generalization is presented. CD variation assessment performance is evaluated on multiple different complex shape patterns, and is benchmarked against an existing qualified measurement methodology.", "As semiconductor manufacturing technology progresses and the dimensions of integrated circuit elements shrink, overlay budget is accordingly being reduced. Overlay budget closely approaches the scale of measurement inaccuracies due to both optical imperfections of the measurement system and the interaction of light with geometrical asymmetries of the measured targets. Measurement inaccuracies can no longer be ignored due to their significant effect on the resulting device yield. In this paper we investigate a new approach for imaging based overlay (IBO) measurements by optimizing accuracy rather than contrast precision, including its effect over the total target performance, using wavelength tunable overlay imaging metrology. We present new accuracy metrics based on theoretical development and present their quality in identifying the measurement accuracy when compared to CD-SEM overlay measurements. The paper presents the theoretical considerations and simulation work, as well as measurement data, for which tunability combined with the new accuracy metrics is shown to improve accuracy performance.", "Due to its potential for high resolution and three-dimensional imaging, soft x-ray ptychography has received interest for nanometrology applications. We have analyzed the measurement time per unit area when using soft x-ray ptychography for various nanometrology applications including mask inspection and wafer inspection, and are thus able to predict (order of magnitude) throughput figures. Here we show that for a typical measurement system, using a typical sampling strategy, and when aiming for 10-15 nm resolution, it is expected that a wafer-based topology (2.5D) measurement takes approximately 4 minutes per \u03bcm2 , and a full three-dimensional measurement takes roughly 6 hours per \u03bcm2 . Due to their much higher reflectivity EUV masks can be measured considerably faster; a measurement speed of 0.1 seconds per \u03bcm2 is expected. However, such speeds do not allow for full wafer or mask inspection at industrially relevant throughput.", "In this paper, we propose to rethink the issue of LER characterization on the basis of the fundamental concept of symmetries. In LER one can apply two kinds of symmetries: a) the translation symmetry characterized by periodicity and b) the scaling symmetry quantified by the fractal dimension. Up to now, a lot of work has been done on the first symmetry since the Power Spectral Density (PSD), which has been extensively studied recently, is a decomposition of LER signal into periodic edges and quantification of the \u2018power\u2019 of each periodicity at the real LER. The aim of this paper is to focus on the second symmetry of scaling invariance. Similarly to PSD, we introduce the multifractal approach in LER analysis which generalizes the scaling analysis of standard (mono)fractal theory and decomposes LER into fractal edges characterized by specific fractal dimensions. The main benefit of multifractal analysis is that it enables the characterization of the multi-scaling contributions of different mechanisms involved in LER formation. In the first part of our work, we present concisely the multifractal theory of line edges and utilize the Box Counting method for its implementation and the extraction of the multifractal spectrum. Special emphasis is given on the explanation of the physical meaning of the obtained multifractal spectrum whose asymmetry quantifies the degree of multifractality. In addition, we propose the distinction between peak-based and valley-based multifractality according to whether the asymmetry of the multifractal spectrum is coming from the sharp line material peaks to space regions or from the cavities of line materis (edge valleys). In the second part, we study systematically the evolution of LER multifractal spectrum during the first successive steps of a multiple (quadruple) patterning lithography technique and find an interesting transition from a peak-based multifractal behavior in the first litho resist LER to a valley-based multifractality caused mainly by the effects of etch pattern transfer steps.", "In this paper, we focus on our most advanced multiple beam technology and next generation multiple beam inspector(MBI) development. We have successfully got 9 images on primary beam module, proving our design concept is correct. We also discussed related technologies, e.g. Computation and fast stage technology to further improve throughput and lower COO. At last MBI new applications are discussed.", "Metal oxide nanomaterials have shown promise for use as EUV resists. Recently, significant efforts have focused on tinoxo clusters that have high absorption coefficient Sn centers and radiation sensitive organic ligands. In our studies, we have investigated a \u03b2-Keggin butyl-Sn cluster (\u03b2-NaSn13), which is charge-neutral and allows studying radiation induced chemistries without interference from counterions. We have used ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) to investigate the contrast properties of the \u03b2-NaSn13 in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and in the presence of ambient oxygen. These contrast studies indicate that ambient oxygen reduces the dose requirements for the solubility transition of the \u03b2-NaSn13 photoresists. APXPS spectra collected before and after the solubility transition shows that ambient oxygen causes a greater loss of butyl ligands from the samples and the formation of more tin oxide for larger doses, suggesting the presence of reactive oxygen species. APXPS was also used to study processes during the post exposure bake, where we compared the differences in film chemistries in ambient oxygen or in UHV. There were only very small differences in the APXPS spectra before exposure and after exposure and the post exposure bake. However, ambient oxygen resulted in some changes for unexposed regions during the post exposure bake; there was a greater ratio of tin oxide to other oxygen species (alkoxy ligands, hydroxyls) for samples annealed in oxygen. These results have significance for EUV and e-beam lithography processing parameters, as well as implications for cluster design and ligand chemistries.", "We have investigated the mechanism of photodecomposition of antimony carboxylate complexes of the type Ph3Sb(O2CR\u2032)2 by means of EUV outgassing in combination with isotopic labelling. A series of photoresists were examined to determine the mechanistic pathways by which volatile photoproducts are generated during EUV exposure. A primary volatile photoproduct from triphenylantimony complexes is benzene. However, the source of hydrogen needed to convert the phenyl groups to benzene (Ph-H) is not obvious. We concluded that the primary source of hydrogen to create benzene is external to the film. Additionally, we have prepared isotopically-labelled versions of Ph3Sb(O2CCH(CH3)2)2 in which the hydrogens in the isobutyrate ligand were replaced with 0, 1, 6 and 7 deuteriums, to provide information about the relative reactivity of these protons during EUV exposure as analyzed by mass spectrometry. High reaction selectivity was identified within the carboxylate dictated by hydrogen location relative to the carbonyl for both benzene and phenol generation. Lastly, the results of these studies were used to propose a series of reaction pathways to generate the aforementioned reaction byproducts.", "Continued improvement in pattern fidelity and reduction in total edge placement errors are critical to enable yield and scaling in advanced devices. In this work, we discuss patterning optimization in a combined two-layer process, using ArFi self-aligned double patterned line and EUV via process in a 10nm test vehicle. In prior work (1), we showed the composite correction ability for lithography and etch systems in single layer processes. Here, we expand on the optimization and setup to improve the single layer process, improve the line edge roughness, and look at a second layer via process. The sum of all those optimizations is the edge placement. Here, we describe the fidelity of the final multilayer pattern and the process budget for a two-layer line and via process in terms of total edge placement error (EPE) (2). In the line process, control of mechanical interactions in the resist and etch process significantly improve line width and line edge roughness (LWR/LER), with a net improvement in LWR of 30% measured after develop, and 18% measured after etch. Pitchwalk is improved using cross wafer etch and litho cooptimization to less than 1.0nm 3\u03c3. For the via process, we determine the root distribution of EPE resulting from the core placement errors at lithography and etch. Results on final multilayer pattern uniformity, overlay, and edge placement are shown.", "When technology node transitions to 14nm and beyond, multi-patterning technique including litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE) and self-aligned double patterning (SADP) with optical lithography is required to achieve device scaling until extreme ultraviolet (EUV) comes into full production. Although LELE and SADP are widely used and well-studied for line-space layers, the challenge of contact layers still remains unknown. In addition, process window (PW) and pattern defects are often characterized with lithography printability only before 7nm. However, when the gate length is pushed to the limitation of immersion lithography, hard mask open etch (HMO) also needs to be studied along with lithography printability to further optimize overall patterning process window (PW). In this paper, we first studied several optical proximity correction (OPC) techniques such as source-mask optimization (SMO) and sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) to improve PW. We then characterized the patterning PW on several patterning defects including single-layer bridging, multi-layer bridging, missing contact, unlanded contact, and extra contact by tuning develop CD (DCD) and HMO CD (MCD). SMO such as illumination source and projection lens wavefront has been extensively used to enlarge depth of focus (DoF). Two different XY polarizations sources were optimized via SMO and were verified on silicon based on overlap process window and mask error enhancement factor (MEEF). Both sources have achieved <90nm lithography PW and <3 MEEF for the selected SRAM and logic designs. The effect of SRAF size on patterning PW were studied by obtaining DoF and exposure latitude (EL) post develop and post HMO. DoF was enlarged by 20nm when increasing SRAF size; however, EL was reduced by 6% post develop and by 2% only post HMO, suggesting patterning PW should be studied at post HMO instead of post develop. When characterizing multi-patterning PW, two types of defects need to be considered: type 1) single-layer bridging and missing contact driven by lithography only; type 2) multi-layer bridging, unlanded contact, and extra pattern driven by both lithography and HMO. Type 1 defects were studied by lithography printability from focus-exposure matrix for different targets (dense/semi-iso/iso) and maximum lithography PW was achieved by adjusting DCD. Type 2 defects were studied by adjusting both DCD and MCD (etch bias). Missing contact was improved by 20x and unlanded contact was improve by 5x when DCD was increased by 8%; however, multi-layer bridging was worsen by 10x, which can be improved by decreasing MCD by 8%. As a result, overall patterning PW can only be obtained by combining lithography PW and HMO optimization.", "The interaction of 91.6 eV EUV photons with photoresist \u2013 in particular chemically amplified resist (CAR) \u2013 is different than exposure at 193 nm and 248 nm wavelengths. The latter is understood well and it is known that photons interact with electrons in the resist\u2019s molecular valence orbitals (for chemically amplified resist (CAR) the photon interacts with the photo acid generator (PAG), which leads to a deprotection reaction on a polymer after a thermal catalytic reaction during a post-exposure-bake.). At EUV however, more steps are involved in the radiolysis process between the absorption of the photon and the final chemical modification. These are related to the generation of primary electrons and their decay to lower energy secondary electrons, and most of this steps are not well understood. In this paper, the reaction products from EUV and low energy electron exposure are examined using Residual Gas Analysis (RGA), which measures and analyzes the outgassing products related to the ongoing reactions. This investigation is applied firstly on a model CAR where details of the resist chemical constituents were known prior to testing. The measurement not only resolved information on the expected acid related reactions from the PAG and protection groups, but also exhibited direct scission reactions of the polymer, where some of them lead to polymerization reactions. Moreover, the measurement quantifies the balance between the different ongoing reactions, which were confirmed by contrast curve measurements. Based on learnings on the model resist, applied the measurement technique to commercial resists, where actual resist chemistry composition is not known. Despite that, it was found that information could be deduced to distinguish between acid related ongoing reactions and direct scission of reaction on the base polymer and quantify their relation. Moreover, different generations of commercial resists based on similar chemistry platform were investigated, which revealed that improvements in printing performance could be explained by PAG reaction yield increase.", "The photo-mechanism of EUV exposures in chemically amplified photoresists are much different than that of previous lithographic wavelengths. Electrons generated during EUV exposure are demonstrated to be a source of acid production through a process referred to as electron trapping. Density functional theory modeling indicates that it is energetically favorable for the PAG molecule to decompose if an electron is trapped. Low-energy electrons unlikely to produce holes and secondary electrons generate acid indicating electron-PAG interactions are capable to induce decomposition. Additionally, a more easily reduced PAG (i.e. higher likelihood of trapping an electron) produces a higher acid yield supporting electron trapping as a process of acid production. An acid indicator, Coumarin 6, was used to determine the number of acids generated per absorbed EUV photon. The results of these measurements indicate that electron-PAG interactions are a source of acid production through electron trapping; thus, increasing the number of electron-hole pairs available to induce chemical reactions would improve sensitivity. It is expected that lower band gap materials produce more electron-hole pairs after an absorption event. Subsequently, these measurements show that lower band gap polymers generate higher acid yields.", "We characterized the reactivity of a model metal resist for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography by using a midInfrared free electron laser (mid-IR FEL). The evaluated metal resist consisted of a zirconium-oxide core and methacrylic-acid (MAA) ligands. The mid-IR spectra of the metal resist were measured to study photoresponse to FEL irradiation. In the spectra, the metal resist exposed with EUV light showed decreases of peaks of MAAs coordinating a metal core and new peaks have emerged. Mid-IR FEL study suggested that the EUV exposure made ligands of the metal resist more reactive, which are possible pointers increasing the sensitivity of the metal resist.", "An in situ resist dissolution analysis of a ZrOx-based metal resist in a typical organic solvent developer [e.g., normal butyl acetate (nBA)] revealed three types of dissolution behaviors: \u201cnano-swelling\u201d at the film surface, \u201cnonuniform dissolution\u201d in the mid-film region, and \u201cresist residue\u201d at the bottom. Attributed to the presence of metal resist film depth inhomogeneities, these dissolution behaviors can impact the EUVL imaging performance of the metal resists. Based on the results obtained, it was also found that developer polarity plays a significant role in obtaining a more uniform or stable dissolution characteristic for metal resists.", "For semiconductor device manufacturing, line width roughness (LWR) and defect reduction is one of the most important items to obtain high yield. In this study we described the development of novel high absorption resists for use in extreme ultra violet (EUV) lithography system and its LWR and nano-bridge reduction capability. Herein decomposition rates of photo acid generator (PAG) and several high EUV absorption compounds were studied to clarify inefficient pass on acid generation mechanism. As a result, it is revealed that existence of decomposition pass on high EUV absorption compounds degenerates PAG decomposition efficiency. New high absorption materials were synthesized with taking into account its decomposition durability and its lithographic performance were investigated. 15-20% dose reduction keeping its LWR value and nano-bridge reduction were observed even at lower dose condition compared to non-high absorption platform.", "Chemically amplified resists have been used for the fabrication of semiconductor devices. With the miniaturization of circuits, the performance of chemically amplified resists approaches their limit due to the acid diffusion. The development of a novel platform without acid diffusion becomes important. In this study, we proposed a negative-type polymer resist used for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and electron beam (EB) lithography. The proposed resist utilizes polarity change and radical crosslinking triggered by EUV/EB exposure. Polymers having triarylsulfonium cations and 2,2,2-trisubstitued acetophenone as side chains were designed for realizing the dual insolubilization property. 2,2,2- trisubstitued acetophenone was incorporated for the efficient radical generation on the polymer structure for the crosslinking. An onium salt was incorporated for the efficient use of thermalized electrons for the polarity change and the radical generation of the side chain. In addition, triphenyl-(4-vinyl-phenyl)-stannane (StTPSn) was incorporated into the resist polymer as the EUV/EB absorber to enhance sensitivity. The highly sensitive property of the designed polymers was demonstrated.", "Current EUV lithography pushes photoresist thickness reduction to sub-30 nm in order to meet resolution targets and mitigate pattern collapse. In order to maintain the etch budgets in hard mask open, the adhesion layer in between resist and hard mask has to scale accordingly. We have reported a grafted polymer brush adhesion layer used in an ultrathin EUV patterning stack and demonstrated sub-36 nm pitch features with significant improvement over existing adhesion promotion techniques [1]. This paper provides further understanding of this class of materials from a fundamental point of view. We first propose a hypothesis of the adhesion mechanism, and probe key factors that could affect adhesion performance. The grafting kinetics study of polymer brush that contains different functional groups to the substrate shows grafting chemistry, time, and temperature are key factors that affect the printing performance. We then conduct a systematic study to understand printing capability at various pitches for different silicon-based substrates. By comparing the process window, we gain comprehensive understanding of the printing limits and failing modes with this approach. We provide a comparative study of a grafted adhesion layer vs. a conventional spin on BARC type material, including defectivity. Pattern transfer to hard mask with varied etch chemistry is conducted to understand the performance of polymer brush during etch.", "Currently, there are many developments in the field of advanced lithography that are helping to move it towards increased HVM feasibility1,2,3,4. Targeted improvements in hardware design for advanced lithography are of interest to our group specifically for HVM metrics such as LWR improvement, dose reduction processes, and defect density reduction. In this work we are building on our experience to improve LWR in an advanced lithographic process by employing novel hardware solutions on our SCREEN DUO coat develop track system5 . Our approach is to implement post-litho annealing to improve resist line roughness. Although it is preferable to achieve such improvements post-etch process we feel, as many do, that post-patterning improvements are a precursor to improvements after etching6 . We hereby present our work utilizing the SCREEN DUO coat develop track system to improve aggressive dense L/S patterns.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is expected to replace current photolithographic methods because of improved resolution. The atomic photon absorption cross section is a central factor that determines the optimal elements around which to base photoresist chemistry, and tin is a strong absorber for EUV photons (~92 eV). \u03b2-NaSn13 ([NaO4(BuSn)12(OH)3(O)9(OCH3)12(Sn(H2O)2)]), one of the organo-tin oxo compounds is being studied in this paper using helium ion beam lithography (HIBL) to demonstrate the patterning performance. High aspect ratio (15:1) and dense line patterns (20 nm half pitch) have been achieved with no defects. Thinner films yielded even smaller feature sizes (linewidths of ~ 10 nm). Thinner films require higher dose to get continuous and solid line patterns presumably due to fewer molecules available for condensation. Studies on various substrates indicate that the high Z substrates can help improve the pattern performance at low doses.", "A trilayer stack of spin-on-carbon (SOC), silicon anti-reflective coating (SiARC) and photoresist (PR) is often used to enable high resolution implant layers for integrated circuit manufacturing. Damage to substrates from SiARC removal using dry etching or aqueous hydrogen fluoride has increased the demand for innovative SiARC materials for implant lithography process. Wet strippable SiARCs (WS-SiARCs) capable of stripping under mild conditions such as SC1 (ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide/water) while maintaining key performance metrics of standard SiARCs is highly desirable. Minimizing the formation of Si-O-Si linkages by introducing organic crosslink sites was effective to impart SC1 solubility particularly after O2 dry etching. Incorporation of acidic groups onto the crosslinking site further improved SC1 solubility. A new siloxane polymer architecture that has SC1 active functionality in the polymer backbone was developed to further enhance SC1 solubility. A new SiARC formulation based on the new siloxane polymer achieved equivalent lithographic performances to a classic SiARC and SC1 strip rate >240\u00c5/min under a relatively low concentration SC1 condition such as ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide/water=1/1/40.", "Hemicellulose spin on carbon (SOC) material was newly developed for hardmask layer. For next generation lithography, high etching selectivity is strongly required. However, there is an issue of a balance of cost and etching selectivity in conventional process. Hemicellulose spin on carbon material is able to overcome this issue by virtue of its chemical structure and newly-developed reactive hemicellulose hardening (R2H). R2H means that hemicellulose unit is selectively hardened by chemical reaction. In this study, deep L/S and hole patterns were fabricated by using hemicellulose SOC with R2H and its dry etching selectivity was 26. Additionally, compatibility with EUV lithography was confirmed. Favorable pattern made of resist for EUV lithography was obtained on Hemicellulose SOC and successfully transferred into hemicellulose SOC.", "Irresistible Materials has previously introduced the HM340 series of fullerene based spin-on carbon, and reported on material characterization, including very high carbon content and high thermal stability. The materials have a low Ohnishi number providing high etch durability and the low hydrogen level allows for high-resolution etching without wiggling. Here we present further investigation of the spin-on-carbon, and demonstrate the flexibility of the platform. Film carbon content can be easily varied from as high as 95% (suitable for high durability etches) to as low as 80% (for instance to use as a sacrificial etch material). We present characterisation of the optical properties of the materials, and process and formulation developments. Work to vary the curing temperature between 200 and 300\u00b0C, and to reduce cure times to 90 seconds or less has been successfully undertaken. Alternative casting solvents have been investigated and work to achieve spin coatable film thickness ranges from less than 50 nm to significantly more than 500nm is described. and spin-coatable film thickness ranges from less than 50 nm to significantly more than 500nm are described. Results from initial planarisation trials are presented together with initial results from on-going work on spin-on carbon formulations that exceed 95% carbon content.", "We have developed block co-polymers (BCPs) in which one of the blocks incorporates silicon and the other does not [1]. These materials provide access to BCPs with high Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (\u03c7) and dry etch selectivity under reactive ion etching (RIE) conditions to provide Sub-20 nm patterns [2]. Recently we have investigated a hybrid chemo/grapho-epitaxy process that provides 20 nm and 10 nm full pitch patterning and we have transferred these patterns into useful substrates. This hybrid process produced 20 nm DSA with fewer defects with this material than the conventional chemo-epitaxial process. Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) confirmed that the BCP features span the entire film thickness on hybrid process wafers [3]. We have now succeeded in demonstrating DSA with poly(4-methoxystyrene-block-4-trimethylsilylstyrene) (PMOST-b-PTMSS) aligned by guidelines comprised of cross linked poly(2-vinylpyridine) (Figure a). The process was demonstrated by cross-section analysis to produce features that span the entire BCP film thickness and the introduction of nitrogen into the guide line provides new evidence for the nature of the interaction between the guide lines and the BCP(Figure b). We have also reported the DSA and pattern transfer of poly(5-vinyl-1,3-benzodioxole-block-pentamethyldisilylstyrene) (PVBD-b-PDSS) at 10 nm full pitch. However, in this case, the DSA involved a trade-off between perpendicularity and dislocation defects [4]. Improved brush materials that selectively graft to an etched Cr surface rather than etched imprint resist provide oriented and aligned 5 nm line-and-space patterns that cleanly traverse the full film thickness thickness (Figure c). 1.

One self-aligned strategy is Directed Self-Assembly (DSA), where block copolymers (BCP) are thermodynamically driven to self-align with a lithographically defined template with chemical contrast and/or topography. Traditionally, DSA has harnessed polymer \u2013 polymer interactions to direct the assembly of BCP. A common implementation of this traditional process utilizes a binary chemical pattern which consists of a preferential homopolymer guide stripe and a non-preferential random copolymer background brush. This preferentiality is well understood by comparing the surface energies of the chemical patterns with those of the blocks of the BCP. The random copolymer naturally has a surface energy between the two blocks and is non-preferential; whereas the homopolymer surface energy matches that of one of the blocks and is therefore preferential. This technique requires the patterning of an additional polymer layer which will not be present in the final device, and is used only for directing the assembly. In spite of this, DSA is a promising technique for patterning due to its inherent ability for CD rectification and pitch multiplication. These inherent benefits are due to the complex thermodynamic process which underlies DSA which drives BCP to form only a given CD and Pitch. It would be particularly advantageous to also encode existing structures into thermodynamic information, then thermodynamics would cause BCP to self-align to these existing structures rectifying placement error. These existing features could be cut masks which are required in order to fabricate devices from line and space arrays. This information could also enforce alignment to active metal features. Here we show a new technique, by which metal \u2013 polymer interactions can be used in place of polymer \u2013 polymer interactions. These metal \u2013 polymer interactions, which cannot be adequately described by conventional surface energy comparisons, allow for a true self-aligned process. We begin by classifying process relevant metals including gold, aluminum, copper, tungsten and cobalt based upon their thermodynamic interactions with PS-b-MMA. We then created guide patterns using metal and dielectric line space arrays. These patterns when combined with DSA allow for lines and space patterns to be self-aligned to any exposed metal features and reduce process constraints on exposure tools. The BCP was thermodynamically driven to snap to the metal which could be a cut mask or could be an active interconnect. These BCP line and space patterns can then be transferred into the underlying substrate to produce sparse arrays of lines and spaces aligned with the underlying metal. Our process can also be used to align line and space patterns to metal layers during back end of the line processing. A similar process could also be used to guide contact hole shrink to correct for placement error in the initial lithographic template.", "We investigate the fabrication of sub-20 nm pillars by DSA lithography using PS-cylinder-forming PS-b-PMMA block copolymer (BCP). The approach is based on the removal of PMMA-matrix by either dry or wet etching to form PS pillars which act as a soft etching mask that can be further transferred to an intermediate hard one and then to the substrate. The process conditions of BCP self-assembly were optimized in terms of annealing temperature, brush layer composition and film thickness. It was demonstrated that PS/PMMA volume fractions of 50/50 in the PS-r-PMMA brush layer is the most adapted to obtain standing PS cylinders. Top-down SEM images showed a hexagonal array of PS cylinders in a PMMA matrix with a natural period of 33.5 nm (determined by Fast Fourier Transform FFT method) and CD around 15 nm. Both wet and dry etching strategies for PMMA removal were discussed. It was shown that UV exposure followed by organic solvent development is necessary to decrease pattern collapsing during PMMA removal step which is the most critical issue for pillar fabrication. PMMA removal by dry etching was shown to completely avoid this pattern collapsing. Finally, pillars etching transfer to typical organic Si containing antireflective coating and spin on carbon (SiARC/SOC) hard mask and then to the silicon substrate was demonstrated. Si pillars of 15 nm CD and 70 nm height were obtained with a straight profile shape.", "This paper presents a design and technology co-optimization (DTCO) study of metal cut formation in the sub-20-nmregime. We propose to form the cuts by applying grapho-epitaxial directed self-assembly. The construction of a DTCO flow is explained and results of a process variation analysis are presented. We examined two different DSA models and evaluated their performance and speed tradeoff. The applicability of each model type in DTCO is discussed and categorized.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a lithographic technique that is expected to be mutually complimentary with ArF immersion lithography, EUV lithography, electron beam direct writing, or nanoimprint for sub-15 nm line patterning and sub-20 nm contact hole patterning. Defect mitigation is the primary challenge behind the use of DSA lithography in practical applications in advanced semiconductor device manufacturing. Therefore, resolve this issue, defect dynamics needs to be clarified using in-situ measurements of self-assembling processes of BCPs in conjunction with modeling approaches. In this work, the evolution of a surface morphology in self-assembling processes of BCPs during annealing was investigated using in-situ atomic force microscope (AFM).5 A JPK NanoWizard ULTRA Speed AFM (JPK Instruments AG) under AC mode (lock-in phase signal image) was employed to carry out in-situ measurements of self-assembling of symmetrical polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) thin films with a thickness of 40 nm, and a domain spacing 30 nm domain spacing (L0) of 30 nm on a 5 nm thick neutral layer (PS-r-PMMA) during the thermal annealing process starting from a disordered as-cast state. The COOrdinated Line epitaxy (COOL) process was applied to provide DSA line multiplication patterns as hybrid guide patterns which act as chemical and physical epitaxy process. The in-situ observation approach of the surface morphology during micro-phase separation process revealed the defect generation and rectification processes in DSA thin films. A combination of the time development data in the in-situ AFM and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GI-SAXS) will also be discussed to develop a kinetic modeling for predicting dynamical changes in the three-dimensional nanostructures.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymer (BCP) thin films has been extensively researched as an alternative lithographic technology to enhance the resolution beyond the limitation of current lithography techniques.[1] One of the most critical factors need to be addressed for DSA process to be accepted at high volume manufacturing (HVM) is defect density of DSA pattern.[2] The defects of thermodynamically driven DSA process, such as the dislocation defects in LiNe flow, are known as kinetically trapped metastable structures.[3] Therefore, a key to eliminate those defects is to find out the effective kinetic pathway of assembly that enables BCP to reach to defect-free structure more easily. In addition to defect annihilation, easy pathway will also allow faster assembly, consequently reducing the cost of ownership of DSA process. The obvious approach for faster assembly in DSA process is to increase annealing temperature. In this study, we address the impact of annealing temperature on DSA process. First, increasing annealing temperature makes the free surface of a PS-b-PMMA film more PMMA preferential. Because of altered boundary condition at the top surface, more careful optimization of backfilling brush was required to maintain preferred orientation of BCP films. Second, the dimension of BCP is also affected by annealing temperature. Temperature dependency of BCP dimension was quantitatively investigated by CD-SEM and DSA-APPS Offline CD Measurement Software (Figure 1a). Based on the measured values, the dimension of chemical pattern is accordingly modified to achieve aligned DSA pattern (Figure 1b). We anticipate our finding from this study can be generally applied for other BCP systems. [1] Ruiz, Ricardo, Huiman Kang, Fran\u00e7ois A. Detcheverry, Elizabeth Dobisz, Dan S. Kercher, Thomas R.

Because the bridge defects are buried three-dimensional defects formed in the diblock copolymer film, it is difficult to observe and determine what causes them. To determine the cause of the bridge defects effectively, self-consistent field theory simulations were used. By reproducing structural characteristics of the bridge defects in the simulation, the cause of the bridge defects were clarified. Finally, we discussed ways to prevent the bridge defects.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is one of the most promising techniques to tackle the everincreasing demand for sub-lithographic features in semiconductor industries. BCPs with high Flory Huggins parameter (\u03c7) are of particular interest due to their ability to self-assemble at the length scale in sub-10 nm regime. However, such high-\u03c7 BCPs typically have imbalanced surface energies between respective blocks, making it a challenge to achieve desired perpendicular orientation. To address this challenge, we mixed a polymeric additive with poly(2-vinylpyridine)- block-polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP-b-PS-b-P2VP) and successfully achieved perpendicular orientation control of the triblock copolymer. The polymeric additive has lower surface energy than both PS and P2VP blocks, and it selectively interacts with high surface energy P2VP blocks via hydrogen bonding. As a result, the surface energies of PS and P2VP blocks are balanced and perpendicular orientation forms upon thermal annealing. Using this approach, we demonstrate 5X density multiplication DSA with a half pitch of 8.5 nm via chemo-epitaxy. This material system is also amenable to sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) without the need to remove the additive, revealing its pattern transfer potential. We believe that this integration-friendly DSA approach using simple thermal annealing holds the promise of bringing high-\u03c7 BCPs to advanced nanopatterning applications.", "A variety of advanced DSA materials have been developed to offer the ease of fabrication and precise control of DSA processes, especially to minimize the number of processing steps and material depositions needed in the DSA implementation. Exemplary materials include spin-on hardmask neutral layer (HM-NL) materials, crosslinkable guiding polymers materials (X-mat), and block copolymers (BCPs) with respective unique combinations of multiple functionalities, e.g., HM-NL materials having etch resistance capability, reflectance control, and non-preferential surface energy to BCP blocks; BCPs with solubility in orthogonal solvents to photoresist, low thermal annealing temperatures required, and no need for top-coat or solvent annealing to get perpendicular orientation. Empowered by these materials, both conventional graphoepitaxy and chemoepitaxy DSA processes can be simplified and enhanced with more potential. For instance, simplified graphoepitaxy DSA by using positive-tone development (PTD) photoresist patterns has been successfully demonstrated. This simplified graphoepitaxy DSA has also led to a facile approach to generate chemoepitaxy guiding patterns.", "Densely patterned contact holes form a key component of integrated circuits, but there are significant challenges to patterning holes with a sub 10-nm radius. The directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers offers a potential solution, where a larger hole is initially patterned and a cylinder forming block copolymer (BCP) is assembled inside. The radius of the inner BCP cylinder can now be used to template the hole radius. It can be particularly challenging to characterize the internal structure of the DSA patterned contact hole, particularly for features such as the residual layer, which may adversely impact the etching process. The high aspect ratio of these features makes top-down characterization nearly impossible, forcing the use of challenging cross-section based approaches. Critical Dimension small angle X-ray scattering (CDSAXS) offers the possibility of characterizing the internal structure of DSA patterned contact holes. CDSAXS is a variable angle scattering technique which combines measurements from different sample angles to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the sample. In this case the scattering yields a two-dimensional pattern, where the off-axis peaks contain additional information about the structure. A model based inverse analysis is then used to fit the scattering and evaluate the structure of the measured target. Contact holes were prepared with a variety of radii and surface treatments in order to evaluate which conditions resulted in optimal assembly of the BCP inside the template. The results demonstrate a correlation between hole radius, surface treatment and residual layer thickness.", "1. INTRODUCTION Directed self-assembly (DSA) lithography is one of the promising next generation lithography. There are mainly 2 requirements for next generation lithography. One is smaller size lithography for logic and DRAM etc.. Another is 3D lithography for 3D semiconductor devices. Regarding DSA lithography, wide-range DSA to expand applicable patterning size was studied. However, there are not well known a potential of 3D lithography; deep pattern of directed self-assembly and deep RIE on Si devices. This paper describes xylan high-chi block copolymer and its wider range of 3D patterning size. 2. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A structure model of xylan block copolymer for wide-range DSA lithography is proposed. It is composed of A and B part in hydrophobic part and C and D part in hydrophilic part. Part D has xylan structure. The xylan block copolymers were synthesized and dissolved in PGMEA. Metal contamination was removed. Then, they were spin-coated on a substrate with guide pattern, annealed and carried out dry development using RIE on 300 mm wafer. Directed self-assembly patterns were evaluated by SEM. In our experimental results, half pitch 8.3 nm of L/S pattern and CD 51 nm of hexagonal hole pattern were obtained. According to these results, xylan block copolymer is suitable for wide-range DSA. Spin coated thickness of xylan block copolymer were evaluated. From 50 nm to 1.3 \u03bcm of thickness was realized and micro phase separation was confirmed. These results suggest xylan block copolymer has a possibility of wider thickness range of micro-phase separation. Si deep RIE of xylan block copolymer was carried out. Silicon depth was 300 nm. It seems that xylan block copolymer is suitable for 3D semiconductor lithography. 3. SUMMARY It was confirmed xylan block copolymer is suitable for 3D patterning size on directed self-assembly lithography. It has a big potential for wider application of not only 2D but also 3D semiconductor devices.", "Lamellar CD-SEM image analysis is one of the key step for the development of new polymer formulations. We present in this paper a new approach for the analysis of lamellar CD-SEM that can be extended to any type of other pattern (contact\u2026) with a machine learning approach. We will also focus on the roughness analysis and specifically the Line Edge Roughness (LER) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) with a robust estimation that takes into account curvature of the line. The last part is dedicated to the introduction of a process optimisation technique using machine learning to optimize process parameters from a first design of experiment.", "Incorporated in relevant design of guiding templates, DSA (Direct Self Assembly) patterning offers a cost-effective manufacturing method to support pattern shrink for advanced technology nodes. The physical characteristics of the BCP moieties and the self-assembly process, pose unique 3D metrology challenges. Pattern fidelity issues of DSA caused by dislocations, forms residual later that can impact pattern fidelity after Etch. Addressing this challenge can assist the R&D groups to monitor material and process quality to meet patterning specifications. In this paper, we highlight the usage of BSE (Back Scattered Electron) metrology as an innovative approach to characterize the DSA process. Experimental data demonstrate the possibility to characterize the polymer residual layer quality and even assess its thickness for the pattern etch transfer. The quality of the information brought by the BSE imaging make it a must-have to quantify the bottom opening for processed of DSA techniques of pitch multiplication and shrink, from which are not visible with conventional SEM images.", "Multi-patterning processes such as self-aligned double patterning (SADP) and self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) present new challenges to the semiconductor device manufacturing such as increased relative cost to previous nodes, longer cycle times, and increased (local) edge placement error between grid and cut/block layers. As the scaling requirements continue, the factors driving both EPE and electrical yield such as overlay, critical dimension control (CDU) and stochastics (LCDU) become greater concerns to multi-patterning. In addition to lithographic process variations, the unit processes such as plasma/vapor etch, deposition, wet/cleans can contributes additional variation in spacer/mandrel profiles leading to poor CDU control and ultimately within-wafer pitch walking. In this paper, we outline alternative SAQP integration schemes to improve the feature profile of both mandrel and spacer to minimize process variability. This patterning scheme designated as fly-cut SAQP introduces new concepts such top spacer removal by chemical-mechanical planarization, mandrel foot mitigation layers, multi-layered mandrel for accurate polish end-point and void-free gap fill to realize high fidelity transfer to the underlying hardmask. Finally, we will demonstrate the effectiveness for this new integration scheme as a candidate for multi-color/self-aligned block (SAB) and highlight the additional benefits of using such an approach.", "In this paper, we demonstrate photosensitive polyimide (PSPI) profile optimization to effectively reduce stress concentrations and enable PSPI as protection package-induced stress. Through detailed package simulation, we demonstrate ~45% reduction in stress as the sidewall angle (SWA) of PSPI is increased from 45 to 80 degrees in Cu pillar package types. Through modulation of coating and develop multi-step baking temperature and time, as well as dose energy and post litho surface treatments, we demonstrate a method for reliably obtaining PSPI sidewall angle >75 degree. Additionally, we experimentally validate the simulation findings that PSPI sidewall angle impacts chip package interaction (CPI). Finally, we conclude this paper with PSPI material and tool qualification requirements for future technology node based on current challenges.", "Laser ablation of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHOST) film was studied using mid-Infrared free-electron laser (mid-IR FEL), of which irradiation wavelength was tuned to the vibrational absorption peaks of PHOST in mid-IR spectral region. A PHOST film was ablated by mid-IR FEL light to produce a clear hole in a PHOST film which suggested the photochemical ablation. As the threshold energy for silicon ablation was larger than that of PHOST, it was possible to ablate a PHOST film without any damage to a silicon substrate. The ablation threshold-energy ratio for PHOST to silicon was less than 0.2 and depended on the mid-FEL wavelength. The ablation threshold for a PHOST film depended also on the film thickness. The highly efficient ablation by mid-IR FEL was found to be due to the vibrational excitations of C-O stretching and C-O-H bending of PHOST.", "Driven by IoT, Industry 4.0, and social media the amount of data to be transferred is tremendously increasing, pushing the need for energy-efficient device concepts for a vast variety of products such as photonic integrated circuits or sensors. Low energy data transfer can be achieved, for example, by replacing part of the electronic circuitry by optical data lines in chip-level packaging, or by introducing optical elements such as specially designed microlenses into semiconductor laser packaging. This also allows to drastically reduce footprints of systems, and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 to increase functionality. On the other hand, a significant demand is seen in providing lower cost and scalable manufacturing processes with technologies which provide highest flexibility. High Precision 3D Printing as novel emerging fabrication technology is a promising tool for optical packaging. It enables to reduce the necessary process steps for packaging to only three to five, independently of the packaging task. This is enabled by a novel and versatile packaging concept where the chips and the dies are already mounted prior to the fabrication of optically functional elements such as optical interconnects or microoptics to couple, for example chip-to-chip or dies to fiber, with passive alignment only. Flexible exposure strategies using High Precision 3D Printing provide both, scalability and high throughput with fabrication times from seconds for optical waveguides and single microlenses to only a few minutes for more complex lens systems. The impact of the fabrication strategy will be discussed with respect to the performance of the optical devices.", "In this work, an evaluation of various ASL processes for 200 mm wafer scale in the HERCULES\u00ae NIL equipment platform available at the CEA-Leti through the INSPIRE program is reported. The surface and adherence energies were correlated to the AFM and defectivity results in order to select the most promising ASL process for high resolution etch mask applications. The ASL performances of the selected process were evaluated by multiple working stamp fabrication using unpatterned and patterned masters though defectivity monitoring on optical based-inspection tools. Optical and SEM defect reviews were systematically performed. Multiple working stamps fabrication without degradation of the master defectivity was witnessed. This evaluation enabled to benchmark several ASL solutions based on the grafted technology develop by ARKEMA in order to reduce and optimize the soft stamp defectivity prior to its replication and therefore considerably reduce the final imprint defectivity for the Smart NIL process.", "Negative tone development is being employed widely because of its superior resolution. Pall is developing filtration products specially targeted for these high resolution applications. High particle retention and low extractables are key aspects of filtration products known to improve on-wafer defectivity. In the current study, we have found that filtration efficiency of the various filter types towards palladium-heptylamine nanoparticles correlates strongly to actual particle removal determined by on-wafer inspection metrology. Furthermore, using the afore mentioned nanoparticle testing metrology, high retention membranes with low extractables were selected. Particle challenge testing is much simpler than on-wafer defectivity inspection and enables faster and effective filtration membrane selection. Based on these results, the selected filtration membrane is expected to perform effective real particle removal in negative tone developer.", "Defect source reduction in leading-edge iArF resists is a critical requirement to improve device performance and overall yield in lithography manufacturing processes. It is believed that some polar polymers can aggregate and be responsible for single or multiple micro-bridge defects. Further investigation into the formation of these defects is needed. We have previously presented the effective removal of gel-like polymers using nylon media [1]. However, as the industry is moving to smaller feature sizes, there is a need to further improve the defect removal efficiency. In this paper, a filter, comprised of a novel membrane called Azora with unique morphology and high flow performance is introduced. This new filter shows better on-wafer in an advanced ArF solution than conventional Nylon and UPE media. In addition, it shows improved stability during chemical storage. Results and possible retention mechanisms are discussed.", "Metal ions in photoresists and solvents pose an ever greater contamination problem in photolithography\u2019s advanced applications. The reduction of metal contaminants is critical in the entire photochemical supply chain. In this paper we demonstrate that two novel membrane purifiers dramatically reduced the metal contents in a range of organic solvents. These solvents are used for photoresist manufacturing and for wafer surface and dispense line rinse in track tools. The impact of flow rate and metal concentrations in the feed on the metal removal efficiency of the purifiers is presented. Furthermore, a study to determine the dominant mechanism of metal reduction in solvents is proposed.", "Airborne molecular contaminants continue to pose cost of ownership challenges in photolithography. Recent advances in understanding siloxane removal have led to the development of an innovative filtration configuration utilizing new media that works in concert to increase overall filter life for acids, bases and silicon containing organic contaminants. This paper examines accelerated testing results, for these state-of-the-art filtration assemblies versus legacy products, to demonstrate improved system performance. The state-of-the-art filtration assemblies have been evaluated in production semiconductor fabs and have shown favorable performance.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers offers opportunities for resolution enhancement of existing patterning by pitch splitting, contact hole (CH) shrinks or, improvement of pattern profile or patterning window.1-2 By co-optimization of guiding pattern geometry, guiding pattern profile, block copolymer formulation, pattern transfer steps, the after-etch DSA patterns meet target pitch ratio. This DSA assessment shows combination of DSA and single iArF-patterning has potential to meet the specific CD dimension and pitch requirement of a conventional patterns that requires double-patterning.", "In recent years, high-\u03c7 block copolymers (BCPs) have been reported to achieve sub-5 nm resolution. These BCPs always require long annealing time at high annealing temperature, which may limit their implementation into semiconductor process. Since hot baking time in conventional semiconductor process is normally less than 3 minutes, how to shorter the thermal annealing time at lower temperature becomes a new topic for the sub-5 nm high-\u03c7 BCPs. In this manuscript, various fluoro-containing BCPs are synthesized by living anionic polymerization or atom transfer radical polymerization. The best BCP formed thermal equilibrium sub-5 nm nano domains after mere 1 min annealing at temperature lower than 100 \u00b0C, which is the fastest thermal annealing process reported so far. BCPs with various morphology and domain size are obtained by precise control of both the length and the molar ratio of the two blocks. The resulted smallest half-pitch of the BCPs are less than 5 nm in lamella and hexagonal morphologies. Linear and starshaped BCPs containing PMMA and fluoro-block are also synthesized, which also shows best phase separation into ca. 6 nm half-pitch, however, the annealing time is 1 hour at 180 \u00b0C.", "For self-aligned multiple patterning, higher etch selectivity between mandrel and spacer is desired to lessen roughness, and thereby prevent pitch walk. We selected dual carbon layers as mandrels and silicon oxide films as spacers for a new self-aligned quadruple patterning process since they potentially provide infinite etch selectivity. We gained insolubility and etch selectivity between two carbon layers by infiltrating trimethylsilyldimethylamine into one of the carbon layers under the ambient atmosphere. Significantly, neither necking nor recess were observed when the spin-on-glass antireflective coating was removed. Thus, a SAQP scheme was developed and successfully demonstrated a sub15-nm halfpitch pattern. Additionally, this scheme improves affordability since all the processes can be performed in the ambient pressure within a coater module.", "Using an electron beam, thin polymeric films loaded with metal nanoparticles of silver were prepared by a one-step irradiation-induced reduction of the metal ions embedded in the polymer. The metal nanoparticles were observed by either optical absorption or microscopy. The mechanism of the reduction of metal ions and of the polymer crosslinking were deduced from the average absorbance measurements. In view of realizing specific patterns of high resolution using the electron beam, electron beam produces 200 nm wide lines that can be separated by unexposed spaces of adjustable width, where precursors were dissolved. The resolution of the electron beam has been exploited to demonstrate the achievement of nanopatterning on polymer films using a direct-writing process. This method supplies interesting applications such as masks, replicas, or imprint molds of improved density and contrast.", "It has been widely known that photoresist (PR) will shrink after ion implantation, which contribute additional side effect on the PR edge placement error and PR effective thickness to against next implantation step, and such effect cannot be ignored with the device size shrinkage. KrF process is still the mainstream patterning solution for advanced logic implantation process. And there are two main category KrF resists: Low activation energy (Ea) Resist and High Ea Resist, which show different shrinkage behaviors, but the inside mechanism has not been discussed clearly so far. In this work, we studied the shrinkage behavior of two kinds of KrF resists (Low Ea Resist and High Ea Resist) under different exposure dose and under different implantation condition (acceleration voltage, dosage, and species). Resist shrinkage percentage and its dependence on time at room temperature are the focus of this study since multi-step implantation is widely used for device tuning purpose. It is observed that high Ea resist shrinks instantly after implantation and change little with time, while low Ea resist not only shrinks at the beginning but also shrinks continually with time at room temperature. The low Ea resist irradiated with ion implantation may undergo a two-step process: 1) polymer crosslinking and chain scission by bombardment of high energy ions; 2) deprotection by acid generated during implantation. We compared the shrinkage behavior with just exposure with different energy and just implantation with different voltage/dosage/species and observed some similar shrinkage trend, which may indicate similar mechanisms, however there still exist different contributions.", "In the semiconductor manufacturing industry, photoresist materials are used for transferring an image to one or more underlying layers. To increase the integration density of semiconductor devices and reduce cost of ownership, continuous development efforts towards advanced lithography processes, such as multiple patterning methods, have been devoted to reduce critical dimension. Multiple patterning processes, however, often encounter challenges to obtain an appreciable process window due to the poor aerial image contrast at the defocus region, not to mention the complexity in process and high cost. Herein, we report a novel CTOTM photoresist trimming solution as a post-lithography spin-on method to enhance photoresist performance in not only effectively reducing critical dimension, but also enabling larger process window, lower line width roughness, less scum and lower defectivity. This is a versatile process that is compatible with both acrylic and polyhydroxystyrene types of photoresists, therefore allowing it to become a general process for a wide range of applications across ArF, KrF and EUV lithography.", "We had developed various Polyphenols and Xanthene derivatives such as NF7177C and NF0197 which showed high heat resistance. In this paper, we reported on new Xanthene derivatives and Polyphenols with characteristics of not only high heat resistance but also low Tg which contributes to good planarization characteristic of Spin-On Carbon Hardmask [1]. One approach to decrease Tg is introducing alkyl group into the Xanthene derivatives. We synthesized the new Xanthene derivatives by the reaction of dihydroxynaphthalene with the aldehydes containing alkyl group. These Xanthene derivatives containing alkyl group showed lower Tg than those not containing alkyl group by about 20~30\u00b0C. Another approach to decrease Tg is increasing flexibility of molecular structure. We synthesized the new Polyphenols (NF71C7, NF71D7, NF91A7, and NF71A7) by the reaction of flexible or asymmetric phenols such as 4,4'- dihydroxydiphenyl ether or 4-phenylphenol. The Tg of these Polyphenols was 70~80\u00b0C and these values were much lower than the existing polyphenol (NF7177C) synthesized from 4,4-biphenol by about 50\u00b0C. We evaluated heat resistance of these Polyphenols with additive, and both NF71C7 and NF71D7 showed comparable heat resistance to NF0197 and NF7177C.", "In the recent semiconductor industry, as the device shrinks, spin-on dielectric (SOD) has been adopted as a widely used material because of its excellent gap-fill, efficient throughput on mass production. SOD film must be uniformly thin, homogeneous and free of particle defects because it has been perfectly perserved after chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) and etching process. Spin coating is one of the most common techniques for applying SOD thin films to substrates. In spin coating process, the film thickness and uniformity are strong function of the solution viscosity, the final spin speed and the surface properties. Especially, airborne molecular contaminants (AMCs), such as HF, HCl and NH3, are known to change to surface wetting characteristics. In this work, we study the SOD film thickness as a function of fluorine contamination on the wafer surface. To examine the effects of airborne molecular contamination, the wafers are directly exposed to HF fume followed by SOD coating. It appears that the film thickness decreases by higher contact angle on the wafer surface due to fluorine contamination. The thickness of the SOD film decreased with increasing fluorine contamination on the wafer surface. It means that the wafer surface with more hydrophobic property generates less hydrogen bonding with the functional group of Si-NH in polysilazane(PSZ)-SOD film. Therefore, the wetting properties of silicon wafer surfaces can be degraded by inorganic contamination in SOD coating process.", "During the photolithographic process, a photoresist is exposed to EUV photons; it is believed that the secondary low energy electrons generated during this exposure decompose the PAG molecule, producing acid. Regardless of how these secondary electrons are produced, whether by incident electrons or photons, the number of acids produced will lead to a solubility change within the photoresist. The goal of this study is to observe the solubility changing reactions due to low energy electron exposures (approximately 5-80 eV). The reactions occurring in the photoresist are monitored through outgassing measurements during EUV photon exposures, and low energy electron exposures. Outgassing results indicate that PAG decomposition occurs with electrons as low as 4.5 eV, and subsequent deprotection reactions are observed due to the acid generated from the PAG. Without being in the presence of PAG decomposition, deprotection reactions are caused by electron exposures with energies down to at least 15 eV. These deprotections that occur in the absence of PAG decomposition are referred to as direct deprotection reactions. Sentaurus Lithography simulations show that these direct deprotection reactions can affect the resist modeling.", "The development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography towards the 22 nm node and beyond depends critically on the availability of resist materials that meet stringent control requirements in resolution, line edge roughness, and sensitivity. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the structure-function relationships in current EUV resist systems are not well understood. In particular, the nanoscale structures of the polymer base and the distributions of photoacid generators (PAGs) should play a critical roles in the performance of a resist system, yet currently available models for photochemical reactions in EUV resist systems are exclusively based on homogeneous bulk models that ignore molecular-level details of solid resist films. In this work, we investigate how microscopic molecular organizations in EUV resist affect photoacid generations in a bottom-up approach that describes structure-dependent electron-transfer dynamics in a solid film model. To this end, molecular dynamics simulations and stimulated annealing are used to obtain structures of a large simulation box containing poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS) base polymers and triphenylsulfonium based PAGs. Our calculations reveal that ion-pair interactions govern the microscopic distributions of the polymer base and PAG molecules, resulting in a highly inhomogeneous system with nonuniform nanoscale chemical domains. Furthermore, the theoretical structures were used in combination of quantum chemical calculations and the Marcus theory to evaluate electron transfer rates between molecular sites, and then kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to model electron transfer dynamics with molecular structure details taken into consideration. As a result, the portion of thermalized electrons that are absorbed by the PAGs and the nanoscale spatial distribution of generated acids can be estimated. Our data reveal that the nanoscale inhomogeneous distributions of base polymers and PAGs strongly affect the electron transfer and the performance of the resist system. The implications to the performances of EUV resists and key engineering requirements for improved resist systems will also be discussed in this work. Our results shed light on the fundamental structure dependence of photoacid generation and the control of the nanoscale structures as well as base polymer-PAG interactions in EVU resist systems, and we expect these knowledge will be useful for the future development of improved EUV resist systems.", "This paper describes the photoreactivity of six organometallic complexes of the type PhnMX2 containing bismuth, antimony and tellurium, where n = 3 for bismuth and antimony and n = 2 for tellurium, and where X = acetate (O2CCH3) or pivalate (O2CC(CH3)3). These compounds were exposed to EUV light to monitor photodecomposition via in situ mass spectral analysis of the primary outgassing products of CO2, benzene and phenol. This paper explores the effect of metal center and carboxylate ligand on the EUV reactivity of these EUV photoresists.", "Spacer-assisted pitch multiplication is a patterning technique that is used on many different critical layers for memory and logic devices. Pitch walk can occur when the spacer process, a combination of lithography, deposition and etch processes, produce a repeating, non-uniform grating of space / line CDs. It has been shown that for spacer-assisted double patterning (SADP), where the lithography pitch is doubled, pitch walk can be reduced by controlling the exposure dose such that the uniformity of the final SADP spaces defined by the core resist mandrel (S1) is balanced with the final SADP space defined by the distance between adjacent SADP lines (S2). For higher pitch multiplications, starting with spacer-assisted quadruple patterning (SAQP) reducing systematic pitch walk with exposure dose becomes more complex.\nCo-optimization of the lithography and etch processing is expected to be required to achieve the best pitch walk control. Previous work has shown that improving the across wafer CD uniformity of the line patterns after core etch has limited impact on the space CD uniformity after the SADP process, whereas the CD uniformity of the spaces after SAQP did show some dependence. There are additional space populations created by an SAQP process. The variation of these different populations, along with the spacer deposited line populations, is the root cause of the non-uniform grating that results in pitch walk. The complex interactions of the lithography and etch processes\u2019 impact on the CD and profile need to be understood to produce the optimal performance.\nPitch walk is a component of the overall Edge Placement Error (EPE) budget. With current nodes using SAQP for multiple device layers and future nodes expected to continue to implement this patterning technique, minimization of pitch walk variability is an important part of overall patterning optimizations. In this work, we will show how cooptimized exposure dose and etch processes for SAQP patterning can improve pitch walk performance. We will provide a target exposure dose metric for a 32nm pitch SAQP grating. The methodology for achieving the best pitch walk performance by combination of etch process optimization with dose correction will also be shown.", "Use of ArFi lithography requires application-specific tuning to maximize patterning process windows. Previous investigations into the effects of light source bandwidth on imaging performance have provided the foundation for this work by identifying significant improvements in Exposure Latitude for reduced sensitivity to dose variations. This study will focus on the increase in image contrast that 200 fm light source E95 bandwidth enables on Self- Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) and Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) core features. Focus of our investigation will be the understanding of roughness and profile variation through different exposure conditions.", "Abstract With ever shrinking feature sizes, the IC industry continues to seek high quality lithography that includes low line edge roughness (LER), high resolution, and straight pattern profiles with solutions to pattern forbidden pitch and hot spots. This paper will discuss a new approach that is proposed to improve these desired characteristics up to the system\u2019s stochastic limit. The nature of LER is stochastic, which can be considered a barrier of patterning resolution. With this barrier, how can engineers take advantage of minimizing stochastic effects to achieve minimum LER and best resolution all while approaching the limitation of intrinsic roughness? In order to understand these effects, a new criterion is proposed that describes the region where variability can occur, called stochastic area thickness (SAT). The SAT of the resist is calculated from optical imaging and resist contrast curve (including acid diffusion effects). This SAT value will be used to develop a second criterion that accounts for effects only seen during the resist developing process, developed stochastic area thickness (DSAT). The DSAT value can be used as an approximation of the actual stochastic effects in the patterning process. Since pattern formation depends on DSAT value, the number of printable die (NPD), or printability, is chosen as DSAT criteria. A variety of lithography conditions with a variety of SAT values were analyzed using this new approach. The results indicate that DSAT correlates well to printability, LER and pattern profile. However, the approaches to minimize DSAT may contradict methods typically used for conventional lithography. Fortunately, for conventional lithography, the DSAT value has a large margin for improvement, and process and material recommendations are proposed.", "Linewidth roughness (LWR) remains a difficult challenge for improvement in all resist materials. In this paper, we intend to focus on the impact of key components of LWR by analyzing the Power Spectral Density (PSD) curves which can be obtained using Fractilia\u2019s MetroLER computational software. We will study systematic changes to ArF resist formulations and correlate these changes to the overall PSD curves. In this manner, we can extract LER/LWR 3\u03c3 values as well as resist correlation length and the low/high-frequency roughness components. We will also investigate the relationship between PSD and LWR through lithographic/etch processing and demonstrate which components correspond with the largest impact. In order to achieve quality data over low and high frequency ranges we changed our standard metrology setup to capture longer lines. By making systematic changes to the ArF resists, we can determine the key impacts of various controllable resist factors on the PSD. Through systematic analysis, we can deconvolute LWR improvements both after develop and after an etch process.", "Line edge roughness (LER) reduction is critical during the patterning process definition and development, as the critical dimension (CD) and pitch scale in advanced semiconductor technology nodes. In this paper, we will focus on a 7nm self-aligned double patterning (SADP) process for use in back end of line (BEOL). Specifically, we will investigate LER from various lithography options and how LER changes through downstream processes, including mandrel etch, spacer deposition, hard mask open, dielectric etch and wet clean. We characterized LER as a function of several mandrel etch parameters such as O2 flow rate, over etch rate percentage and polymer deposition rates. We also characterized LER response to dielectric etch parameters and found that while some etch processes may smooth high frequency LER, there are additional cases where the final etch and wet-clean increased LER and line wiggling. Overall, we observed that lithography is the primary source of LER and we have the opportunity to reduce LER by both design and process optimization. In this paper we focused on characterization of a standard logic cell with varied CD and pitch. We looked through various designs, retargeting as well as both negative tone developer (NTD) and positive tone developer (PTD) resists for the LER reduction. We also analyzed the image log slope (ILS) of each corresponding edge and the process windows of the resist candidates. We concluded that ILS improvement and resist selection are the primary knobs to reduce LER. With optimization, we can achieve LER close to the process assumption targets for 7nm technology node. Further LER reduction techniques are definitely needed in both 7nm and future nodes even with migration from 193nm to EUV lithography.", "EUV lithography enables the transition from multiple patterning in DUV back to single patterning in EUV, with the associated cost benefit. While imaging and patterning becomes easier with EUV, cross-platform overlay performance needs to be taken into account.\nWith quadruple patterning, the matching performance is driven by the platform capabilities, with platform specific fingerprints not contributing to the matching performance as they are similar for each layer. Introducing EUV automatically means we need to compensate for the differences in the platform fingerprints, as they bring a penalty in the DUV-EUV matching budget.\nThis paper will explain what the main overlay contributors in cross-platform matched machine overlay are and how they can be cancelled or reduced using additional correction measures, with the goal to reach below 2.0 nm cross matched machine overlay.", "We demonstrate high volume manufacturing feasibility of 7 nm technology overlay correction requirement. This stateof- the-art overlay control is achieved by (i) overlay sampling optimization and advanced modeling, (ii) alignment and advanced process control optimization, (iii) multiple target overlay optimization, and (iv) heating control. We will also discuss further improvements in overlay control for 7 nm technology node and beyond including computational metrology, extreme ultraviolet and optic tools overlay matching control, high order alignment correction, tool stability improvement, and advanced heating control.", "All wafers moving through a microchip nanofabrication process pass through a lithographic apparatus for most, if not all, layers. With a lithographic apparatus providing a massive amount of data per wafer, this paper will outline how physicsbased models can be used to refine UVLS (ultraviolet level sensor) metrology into four unique inputs for use in a deep learning network. Due to the multi-dimensional cross correlation of our deep learning network, we then show that training to a sparse overlay layout with dense inputs results in a hyper dense overly signature. On a testing dataset blind to the training we show that the accuracy of the predictive computational overlay metrology can capture R2 up to 0.81 of the signature in overlay Y. As a real-world application, we outline how our predictive computational overlay metrology can then be used to designate which wafer combinations, coming from the TWINSCAN system, should have overlay measured with a YieldStar system for possible use with APC (advanced process control).", "Three methods to minimize the impact of alignment mark asymmetry on overlay variation are demonstrated. These methods are measurement based optimal color weighting (OCW), simulation based optimal color weighting, and wafer alignment model mapping (WAMM). Combination of WAMM and OCW methods delivers the highest reduction in overlay variation of 1.3nm (X direction) and 1.2nm (Y direction) as compared to best single color recipe. Simulation based OCW produces a similar reduction in overlay variation as compared to measurement based OCW, and simulation based OCW has the advantage that the scanner alignment recipe with optimize weights can be determined before the mark asymmetry excursion has occurred. Finally, WAMM is capable of reducing the contribution of mark asymmetry on overlay by using a more optimal high order wafer alignment recipe. Capabilities of WAMM can also be combined with OCW solutions.", "Manufacturing embedded DRAM deep trench capacitors can involve etching very deep holes into silicon wafers1. Due to various design constraints, these holes may not be uniformly distributed across the wafer surface. Some wafer processing steps for these trenches results in stress effects which can distort the silicon wafer in a manner that creates localized alignment issues between the trenches and the structures built above them on the wafer.\nIn this paper, we describe a method to model these localized silicon distortions for complex layouts involving billions of deep trench structures. We describe wafer metrology techniques and data which have been used to verify the stress distortion model accuracy. We also provide a description of how this kind of model can be used to manipulate the polygons in the mask tape out flow to compensate for predicted localized misalignments between design shapes from a deep trench mask and subsequent masks.", "All chipmakers understand that variability is the enemy of any process and that defectivity reduction is essential to improving yield which translates to profit. Aggressive process window and yield specifications put tight requirements on the DUV light source which will impact scanner imaging performance. Accurate identification of defectivity caused by on wafer hotspots along with the impact on process windows can be accomplished using existing industry capability. ASML\u2019s Brion Lithography Manufacturing Checker (LMC) can be employed using existing models to perform hotspot analysis and verify process window impact for current and future 193 nm nodes. In this presentation, we review a methodology to understand the effect bandwidth variation has on hotspot variability and defect variation on specific customer designs. Initial studies are based on a large number of customer specific 90 nm pitch layouts where bandwidth variability is investigated for its impact on hotspot variability. Defect density maps are generated from the baseline process with additional maps generated at various bandwidth ranges. This methodology has been applied to Cymer\u2019s DynaPulse and new DynaPulse2 bandwidth control technologies demonstrating the impact that bandwidth variation can influence process defectivity levels.", "Within the current paper, we will concentrate on the well-known CDC technique from Carl Zeiss to improve the CD distribution of the wafer by improving the reticle CDU and its impact on hotspots and Litho process window. The CDC technique uses an ultra-short pulse laser technology, which generates a micro-level Shade-In-Element (also known as \"Pixels\") into the mask quartz bulk material. These scatter centers are able to selectively attenuate certain areas of the reticle in higher resolution compared to other methods and thus improve the CD uniformity.\nIn a first section, we compare the CDC technique with scanner dose correction schemes. It becomes obvious, that the CDC technique has unique advantages with respect to spatial resolution and intra-field flexibility over scanner correction schemes, however, due to the scanner flexibility across wafer both methods are rather complementary than competing. In a second section we show that a reference feature based correction scheme can be used to improve the CDU of a full chip with multiple different features that have different MEEF and dose sensitivities. In detail we will discuss the impact of forward scattering light originated by the CDC pixels on the illumination source and the related proximity signature. We will show that the impact on proximity is small compared to the CDU benefit of the CDC technique.\nFinally we show to which extend the reduced variability across reticle will result in a better common electrical process window of a whole chip design on the whole reticle field on wafer. Finally we will discuss electrical verification results between masks with purposely made bad CDU that got repaired by the CDC technique versus inherently good \u201cgolden\u201d masks on a complex logic device. No yield difference is observed between the repaired bad masks and the masks with good CDU.", "Inverse lithography is increasingly being used as a viable OPC solution to maximize process window (PW), improve CD uniformity (CDU) and minimize the mask error factor (MEF), especially for memory devices. The device yield is typically limited by the process window of a few critical layers, and the Via layer is identified as one of the process window limiters for advanced 3D-NAND devices. To maximize the on-chip yield, ASML has developed advanced image based Mask-3D (M3D) inverse technology that can optimize freeform mask shapes and enhance design printability throughout the mask optimization flow. Mask rule checks (MRC) and side-lobe printing are optimized simultaneously to deliver the maximum process window.\nThe advanced image based M3D inverse lithography technology (ILT) is used to perform full chip mask correction on the Via layer of a 3D-NAND device. 3D NAND devices contain highly repetitive cell and page buffer patterns. To ensure the full chip device performance, the consistency of the mask correction is important. Our strategy is to use the computationally intensive mask optimization solution from the new advanced image based M3D inverse technology to generate a freeform mask which gives the best lithography performance. We then use Tachyon\u2019s Pattern Recognition and Optimization (PRO) engine to propagate the freeform mask solution of the repetitive patterns to the full chip. The periphery of the chip is optimized using conventional OPC methods. The simulation results from the advanced image based M3D inverse technology are compared against the baseline flow, which uses a standard inverse solution. The simulation results from both the flows are further validated on wafer. Significant improvement in overlapping process window (OPW) and CD uniformity is observed using the new advanced inverse technology. The simulation data shows a 32% improvement in depth of focus (DOF), a 5% improvement in the image log slope (ILS) and a 25% reduction in best focus shift (BFS) range. The improvement has also been verified at the wafer-level.", "Deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely used in many applications in the past few years. Their capabilities to mimic high-dimensional complex systems make them also attractive for the area of semiconductor engineering, including lithographic mask design. Recent progress of mask writing technologies, including emergent techniques such as multi-beam raster scan mask writers, has made it possible to produce curvilinear masks with essentially \u201cany\u201d shapes. The increased granularity of mask shapes brings enormous advantages and challenges to resolution enhancement techniques (RET) such as optical proximity correction (OPC), Inverse lithography technologies (ILT), and other advanced mask optimization tools. Attempts of replacing the conventional segment based OPC by the ILT and other advanced solutions for full chip mask tapeout have been around for over a decade. Extremely slow mask data total-turnaround time is one of the major blocks. Therefore, its applications have been limited to small clip based applications such as for scanner source optimization, mask optimization only used for hotspot fixing and hierarchical memory designs. In this paper we present a new technique to apply DNN in our newly developed GPU-accelerated mask optimization platform, which reduces the runtime significantly without sacrificing the accuracy and convergence. This new tool combines deep learning, GPU computing platform and advanced optimization algorithms, and provides a fast and accurate solution for mask optimization in the sub-10nm tech nodes.", "An approach of solving the inverse lithography problem as a nonlinear, constrained minimization problem over a domain of mask pixels was suggested in the paper by Yu. Granik \"Fast pixel-based mask optimization for inverse lithography'' in 2006.\nThis idea was advanced to account for pinching and bridging print contour constraints in the paper \"Controlling Bridging and Pinching with Pixel-based Mask for Inverse Lithograph'' by S. Kobelkov and others in 2015.\nThe present paper extends this approach further for solving the enclosure print image constraints, getting maximum common depth of focus, and obtaining uniform PV-bands.\nNamely, we suggest several objective functions that express penalty for constraint violations. Their minimization with gradient descent methods is considered. A number of applications have been tested with ILTbased pxOPC tool for DUV metal, contacts, and EUV metal layouts; results are discussed showing benefits of each approach.", "The resist effect may have a significant impact on source mask optimization (SMO), because the CD change in response to dose, defocus and mask size variations can be substantially modified by the resist effect. In this paper, we elaborate on how the resist effect, represented by compact resist models, changes the cost function of SMO and affects the optimized source shapes and the corresponding lithographic performance. Based on the results, we present the guidelines of using compact resist models in SMO, especially for the case of the negative tone development (NTD) process.", "Traditionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) on cell array patterns in memory layout uses simple bias rules to correct hierarchically-placed features, but requires intensive, rigorous lithographic simulations to maximize the wafer process latitude. This process requires time-consuming procedures to be performed on the full chip (excluding the cell arrays) to handle unique cell features and layout placements before (and even sometimes after) OPC. The time required limits productivity for both mask tapeouts and the wafer process development. In this paper, a new cell array OPC flow is introduced that reduces turnaround-time for mask tapeouts from days to hours, while maintaining acceptable OPC quality and the perfect geometric consistency on the OPC output that is critical for memory manufacturing. The flow comprises an effective sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) insertion and OPC for both the cell array and the peripheral pattern areas. Both simulation and experimental results from actual wafer verification are discussed.", "Sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF) insertion techniques have been effectively used for a long time now to increase process latitude in the lithography patterning process. Rule-based SRAF and model-based SRAF are complementary solutions, and each has its own benefits, depending on the objectives of applications and the criticality of the impact on manufacturing yield, efficiency, and productivity. Rule-based SRAF provides superior geometric output consistency and faster runtime performance, but the associated recipe development time can be of concern. Model-based SRAF provides better coverage for more complicated pattern structures in terms of shapes and sizes, with considerably less time required for recipe development, although consistency and performance may be impacted. In this paper, we introduce a new model-assisted template extraction (MATE) SRAF solution, which employs decision tree learning in a model-based solution to provide the benefits of both rule-based and model-based SRAF insertion approaches. The MATE solution is designed to automate the creation of rules/templates for SRAF insertion, and is based on the SRAF placement predicted by model-based solutions. The MATE SRAF recipe provides optimum lithographic quality in relation to various manufacturing aspects in a very short time, compared to traditional methods of rule optimization. Experiments were done using memory device pattern layouts to compare the MATE solution to existing model-based SRAF and pixelated SRAF approaches, based on lithographic process window quality, runtime performance, and geometric output consistency.", "Despite the large difficulties involved in extending 193i multiple patterning and the slow ramp of EUV lithography to full manufacturing readiness, the pace of development for new technology node variations has been accelerating. Multiple new variations of new and existing technology nodes have been introduced for a range of device applications; each variation with at least a few new process integration methods, layout constructs and/or design rules. This had led to a strong increase in the demand for predictive technology tools which can be used to quickly guide important patterning and design co-optimization decisions.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid predictive patterning method combining two patterning technologies which have each individually been widely used for process tuning, mask correction and process-design cooptimization. These technologies are rigorous lithography simulation and inverse lithography technology (ILT). Rigorous lithography simulation has been extensively used for process development/tuning, lithography tool user setup, photoresist hot-spot detection, photoresist-etch interaction analysis, lithography-TCAD interactions/sensitivities, source optimization and basic lithography design rule exploration. ILT has been extensively used in a range of lithographic areas including logic hot-spot fixing, memory layout correction, dense memory cell optimization, assist feature (AF) optimization, source optimization, complex patterning design rules and design-technology co-optimization (DTCO). The combined optimization capability of these two technologies will therefore have a wide range of useful applications. We investigate the benefits of the new functionality for a few of these advanced applications including correction for photoresist top loss and resist scumming hotspots.", "Various computational approaches from rule-based to model-based methods exist to place Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAF) in order to increase process window for lithography. Each method has its advantages and drawbacks, and typically requires the user to make a trade-off between time of development, accuracy, consistency and cycle time.\nRule-based methods, used since the 90 nm node, require long development time and struggle to achieve good process window performance for complex patterns. Heuristically driven, their development is often iterative and involves significant engineering time from multiple disciplines (Litho, OPC and DTCO).\nModel-based approaches have been widely adopted since the 20 nm node. While the development of model-driven placement methods is relatively straightforward, they often become computationally expensive when high accuracy is required. Furthermore these methods tend to yield less consistent SRAFs due to the nature of the approach: they rely on a model which is sensitive to the pattern placement on the native simulation grid, and can be impacted by such related grid dependency effects. Those undesirable effects tend to become stronger when more iterations or complexity are needed in the algorithm to achieve required accuracy.\nASML Brion has developed a new SRAF placement technique on the Tachyon platform that is assisted by machine learning and significantly improves the accuracy of full chip SRAF placement while keeping consistency and runtime under control. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is trained using the target wafer layout and corresponding Continuous Transmission Mask (CTM) images. These CTM images have been fully optimized using the Tachyon inverse mask optimization engine. The neural network generated SRAF guidance map is then used to place SRAF on full-chip. This is different from our existing full-chip MB-SRAF approach which utilizes a SRAF guidance map (SGM) of mask sensitivity to improve the contrast of optical image at the target pattern edges.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that machine learning assisted SRAF placement can achieve a superior process window compared to the SGM model-based SRAF method, while keeping the full-chip runtime affordable, and maintain consistency of SRAF placement . We describe the current status of this machine learning assisted SRAF technique and demonstrate its application to full chip mask synthesis and discuss how it can extend the computational lithography roadmap.", "In advanced nodes, the extension of DUV lithography deep into the sub-wavelength dimensions has led to exploration of many new Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RET). Generally speaking, these RET have enabled higher resolution capabilities using the same exposure wavelength, but at the cost of increasingly complex mask optimization process. One such technique applied to perform Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is called Inverse Lithography Technique (ILT). It promises the best possible theoretical mask design by solving the inverse problem, where the optical transform from mask to wafer image is solved in reverse using a rigorous mathematical approach [1]. Although the benefits and potentials of ILT in producing a single exposure mask are well documented [2], its implementation in multiple patterning OPC (MP-OPC) is less explored. In this paper, an ILT mask optimization is applied on a metal layer, consisting of 3 exposures in a litho-etch x 3 (LELELE) process flow. It demonstrates the application of both multi-exposure and etch awareness within the ILT mask correction scheme. This is accomplished by including inter-layer constraints for the resist and the post-etch contours in the objective function of the ILT optimization. The ability to reduce potential interexposure failure modes as well as the associated increase in computational resources will be assessed. Additionally, the results will be compared against a conventional model-based OPC with similar multi-exposure and etch awareness.", "As semiconductor product development based on shrinkage continues, the accuracy and difficulty required for the model based optical proximity correction (MBOPC) is increasing. OPC simulation time, which is the most timeconsuming part of MBOPC, is rapidly increasing due to high pattern density in a layout and complex OPC model.\nTo reduce OPC simulation time, we attempt to apply graphic processing unit (GPU) to MBOPC because OPC process is good to be programmed in parallel. We address some issues that may typically happen during GPU-based OPC simulation in multi thread system, such as \u201cout of memory\u201d and \u201cGPU idle time\u201d. To overcome these problems, we propose a thread scheduling method, which manages OPC jobs in multiple threads in such a way that simulations jobs from multiple threads are alternatively executed on GPU while correction jobs are executed at the same time in each CPU cores. It was observed that the amount of GPU peak memory usage decreases by up to 35%, and MBOPC runtime also decreases by 4%. In cases where out of memory issues occur in a multi-threaded environment, the thread scheduler was used to improve MBOPC runtime up to 23%.", "As the technology node for the semiconductor manufacturing approaches advanced nodes, the scattering-bars (SBs) are more crucial than ever to ensure a good on-wafer printability of the line space pattern and hole pattern. The main pattern with small pitches requires a very narrow PV (process variation) band. A delicate SB addition scheme is thus needed to maintain a sufficient PW (process window) for the semi-iso- and iso-patterns. In general, the wider, longer, and closer to main feature SBs will be more effective in enhancing the printability; on the other hand, they are also more likely to be printed on the wafer; resulting in undesired defects transferable to subsequent processes. In this work, we have developed a model based approach for the scattering-bar printing avoidance (SPA). A specially designed optical model was tuned based on a broad range of test patterns which contain a variation of CDs and SB placements showing printing and non-printing scattering bars. A printing threshold is then obtained to check the extra-printings of SBs. The accuracy of this threshold is verified by pre-designed test patterns. The printing threshold associated with our novel SPA model allows us to set up a proper SB rule.", "As the computational requirements for post tape out (PTO) flows increase at the 7nm and below technology nodes, there is a need to increase the scalability of the computational tools in order to reduce the turn-around time (TAT) of the flows. Utilization of design hierarchy has been one proven method to provide sufficient partitioning to enable PTO processing. However, as the data is processed through the PTO flow, its effective hierarchy is reduced. The reduction is necessary to achieve the desired accuracy. Also, the sequential nature of the PTO flow is inherently non-scalable. To address these limitations, we are proposing a quasi-hierarchical solution that combines multiple levels of parallelism to increase the scalability of the entire PTO flow. In this paper, we describe the system and present experimental results demonstrating the runtime reduction through scalable processing with thousands of computational cores.", "Biopolymers represent natural, renewable and abundant materials. Their use is steadily growing in various areas (food, health, building \u2026) but, in lithography, despite some works, resists, solvents and developers are still oil-based and hazardous chemicals. In this work, we replaced synthetic resist by chitosan, a natural, abundant and hydrophilic polysaccharide. High resolution sub-micron patterns were obtained through chitosan films as water developable, chemically unmodified, positive tone mask resist for an eco-friendly electron beam and deep-UV (193 nm) lithography process. Sub-micron patterns were also successfully obtained using a 248 nm photomasker thanks to the addition of biosourced photoactivator, riboflavin. Patterns were then transferred by plasma etching into silica even for high resolution patterns.", "From the first digital cameras which appeared during the 70s to cameras of current smartphones, image sensors have undergone significant technological development in the last decades. The development of CMOS image sensor technologies in the 90s has been the main driver of the recent progresses. The main component of an image sensor is the pixel. A pixel contains a photodiode connected to transistors but only the photodiode area is light sensitive. This results in a significant loss of efficiency. To solve this issue, microlenses are used to focus the incident light on the photodiode. A microlens array is made out of a transparent material and has a spherical cap shape. To obtain this spherical shape, a lithography process is performed to generate resist blocks which are then annealed above their glass transition temperature (reflow).\nEven if the dimensions to consider are higher than in advanced IC nodes, microlenses are sensitive to process variability during lithography and reflow. A good control of the microlens dimensions is key to optimize the process and thus the performance of the final product.\nThe purpose of this paper is to apply SEM contour metrology [1, 2, 3, 4] to microlenses in order to develop a relevant monitoring methodology and to propose new metrics to engineers to evaluate their process or optimize the design of the microlens arrays.", "\u2018Double\u2019 Displacement Talbot Lithography (D2TL) is proposed as a new, high-throughput and rapid tool that allows the fabrication of complex periodic nano- to micron patterns over a large area (up to 100 200 mm). This method is a combination of conventional Displacement Talbot Lithography (DTL) [1] and a planar displacement to make more complex shapes. The more straight-forward DTL technique utilizes the periodic diffraction pattern on all space axes that results when a periodic mask is illuminated by a planar wave (Talbot effect); by displacing the wafer along the axis of illumination over integer spatial periods, called the Talbot length, the low depth of field is overcome. In D2TL, by additionally moving the wafer perpendicular to the axis of illumination, the range and complexity of features possible across whole wafers is dramatically extended. Furthermore, a single periodic mask can be used to create a large number of different patterns by using different lateral displacements. In order to demonstrate the capability of this technique, a number of proof-of-principle experiments have been performed using a hexagonal mask with a 1.5 micron pitch with a positive i-line resist on silicon wafers. Firstly, dual exposures before and after sub-micron, nm-precision, translations show the transition between coincident, merged and isolated features. Secondly, circular displacements of differing amplitudes were applied during single exposures, which led to a large variety of shapes being obtained: positive or negative honeycomb, large dot or large holes, rings and periodic cancelation of dot site with a change of pitch. These results compare well with simulations created using MATLAB that calculate the integrated intensity distribution for each lateral position in the photoresist. Importantly, the simulations take into account weaker, secondary features in the intensity map that result from unwanted constructive interference. The modelling allows greater insights into these secondary patterns, helping to diminish their impact through tuning the filling factor and pitch of the hexagonal mask. The complexity of patterns that can be produced using this technique depends on the minimum feature size for a given periodicity and the relative intensity of any unwanted secondary features. Simulations of the intensity maps coupled with the development model of high-contrast, i-line resists show a strong influence on whether an amplitude or phase mask is used, with a strong non-linear dependence on pitch and filling factor of the mask. Specific optimum masks can be identified that offer the greatest opportunity for exploiting this new technique. In summary, D2TL offers the possibility to create a multitude of patterns from a single mask by simply controlling the lateral displacement during or between successive exposures. Successful implementation of this technique requires an in-depth understanding of the DTL process and simulation tools to correctly account for proximity effects.

In this source, a diode laser at 772nm is amplified by a tapered amplifier in master-oscillator power-amplifier configuration and frequency-quadrupled in two subsequent enhancement cavities using lithium triborate and potassium fluoro-beryllo-borate nonlinear crystals to generate the emission at 193 nm. The high coherence and brilliance of such an illumination source is predestined for plane wave mask-aligner illumination, crucial in particular for high-resolution lithographic techniques such as Talbot lithography and phase-shift masks. Talbot lithography takes advantage of the diffraction effect to image periodic mask features via self-replication in multiples of the Talbot distance behind the photomask when exposed by a plane wave. By placing a photoresistcoated wafer in one of the Talbot planes, the mask pattern is replicated in the resist. Periodic patterns with diverse shapes are required for wire grid polarizers, diffraction gratings, and hole arrays in photonic applications as well as for filters and membranes. Using an amplitude mask with periodic structures, we demonstrate here with such a technique sub-micron feature sizes for various designs at a proximity gap of 20 \u00b5m.", "In order to meet the industry\u2019s increasingly demanding requirements, especially in the area of improving pattern edge placement error for multiple patterning processes, we have developed the leading edge NSR-S635E ArF immersion scanner.

This paper will describe how imaging margins can be increased by optimizing light source bandwidth settings. Advancements include new hardware and software that enable industry leading bandwidth performance and control. In addition, on-wafer measurements were collected showing the progressive improvements gained with lowering bandwidth on an existing mask. As system availability is a key enabler for chipmakers, the introduction of this new DUV light source includes improvements that continue to improve productivity by increasing service intervals by >30% while also providing sustainability enhancements.", "High efficiency coupling of the array of UV light diode light source could be able to replace the traditional mercury light source, while mercury light source requires a large amount of electricity, condenser optics and volume, with hazard environmental issue. It is an urgent need for further requirement of light source for lithography. Although array UVLED could be a replacement of light sources of lithography, there are some existent optical parameters that not fit for optical coupling, such as large divergent cone angle of single chip and half divergent angle of array, which are weak the possibility of application in lithography. Before the broadly accepted by lithography, those shortages have to be overcome. Some techniques, such as designing small divergent cone angle of single chip, or eliminating divergent angle have suggested by fly eye and other methods, yet all of those methods, only improve the coupling efficiency and uniformity of emitted surface in some limited extent. The project is to develop a high coupling efficiency of the optical system used in the array of UV light diodes, which can make the high coupling efficiency, despite UVLED has a small size and large divergent angle. The optical design of illumination has carried out for array UVLED, an illumination optics has designed based on Koehler type illumination, and it has shown reducing the divergent angle to increase in coupling efficiency between the Array UVLED to the mask of lithography. The uniformity of average power has shown excellently fitted for high quality lithography in direct exposure or lens exposure.", "Multiple patterning ArF immersion lithography has been expected as the promising technology to meet tighter process control requirements. The most important features for the next generation light sources are improvement of chip yield, enhancement of productivity and reduction of operational costs for chipmakers [1][2]. One of key performance for light source is E95 bandwidth, which has become more important parameter for enhancing process margin and improving device productivity. A faster actuator to move a lens improves E95 bandwidth stability [3]. This technology enables 3\u03c3 of E95 bandwidth field average to be under 10 fm. This contributes to more precise CD control and improves device yield. Latest LNM enables E95 bandwidth to lower from the standard 300 fm to 200 fm [4]. The large shrinkage for E95 bandwidth is achieved by introducing the ingenious design in LNM. High purity E95 bandwidth improves imaging contrast and therefore increases exposure latitude. A new control algorithm enables E95 bandwidth to vary up to 450 fm, leveraging the movable lens. The combination of the new LNM, the movable lens and the new bandwidth control algorithm enables E95 bandwidth to control between 200 fm and 450 fm [5]. The tunable E95 bandwidth technology can improve process productivity for chip makers by compensating not only machine to machine difference of imaging contrast but also difference of imaging contrast between different generation scanners. The tunable E95 bandwidth technology has no influence on key laser performance indicator, dose stability, wavelength stability, E95 bandwidth stability, etc. On the other hand, to reduce downtime and operational costs for chipmakers, the lifetime of consumable modules such as a chamber and a line narrowing module (LNM) is needed to be extended. New electrodes with chamber enables chamber lifetime to extend from 60 billion pulses (Bpls) to 70 Bpls. Furthermore, new optical design in LNM enables the lifetime to extend from 60 Bpls to 110 Bpls. A new ArF excimer laser, GT65A, maximizes device yield, process productivity and minimizes the operational costs for chipmakers.", "Absorption-induced lens heating within optical elements can diminish the achievable resolution of the lithographic process in semiconductor wafer steppers, as the distortion of the transmitted wavefront leads to deteriorations of the imaging performance. In reverse, sensitive monitoring of thermally induced wavefront distortions also establishes a procedure for fast and precise absorption measurements, since the extent of deformation is directly proportional to the absorption loss. In this paper a parallelized photo-thermal absorption measurement system based upon a Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor with extreme sensitivity is presented, providing quantitative absorptance data of optical materials with sub-ppm resolution. Caused by the temperature dependence of the refractive index as well as thermal expansion, the initially plane wavefront of a probe beam is distorted into a convex or concave lens, depending on sign and magnitude of index change and expansion. Wavefront deformations as low as 50pm (rms) can be registered. Moreover, due to the spatial resolution of the employed wavefront sensor, the technique is insensitive to misalignments, allowing for a rapid and reliable assessment of material quality. Absolute calibration of the absorption data is achieved by comparison with a thermal calculation. The method accomplishes not only to measure absorptances of plane optical elements, but also wavefront deformations and focal shifts in lenses as well as in complex optical systems. Thus, it is employed already at many places in the semiconductor industry for quality assurance of test optics and components. Along with a description of the technique we present results from absorption measurements on coated and uncoated optics as well as mirrors for 193nm and 248nm. Extensions to EUV optics are discussed.", "The light source continues to play an important role in the evolution of semiconductor lithography - helping chip manufacturers to usher in their next generation nodes. Over the years, Gigaphoton has introduced innovative solutions to meet the various demands of the industry, including Injection Lock technology, active bandwidth control, and green technologies for conserving gas and electricity. Today, the needs of chip manufacturer have grown to become highly diverse and dynamic, because the set of challenges faced by each manufacturer is equally diverse and dynamic. This makes developing software solutions very challenging - as they must address a very broad scope of needs. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly important to gain a much deeper understanding of all aspects of how and to what level the light source is actively affecting each chip manufacturer\u2019s wafer output - both in terms of yield and cost - for solutions and technologies to be effective and meaningful. However, there are many challenges to achieving this.", "Conventionally, lithography technology has contributed to the miniaturization of semiconductors by improving resolutions achieved though making wavelength shorter and shorter. However, with the advent of immersion lithography and multiple patterning technologies, the trend of shorter wavelength has slowed down. Instead, immersion lithography technology is playing a major role to support mass production. In the past years, lithography units have achieved further evolution enabling the contrast to be further improved by mitigating optical aberration gap. In line with this, a parameter called E95 which is for Monochromaticity for light sources has been mitigated, which made it possible to further reduce the spectrum width.Assuming that optical setting parameters NA and \u03c3 are set for the same value in a legacy lithography unit and a latest model lithography unit, there should be differences in parameters such as Iso-Dense Bias which is sensitive to contrast, due to optical differences and the difference in contrast caused by the optical differences. For mass production sites equipped with various immersion lithography units keeping up with the times, we have studied the feasibility to compensate the CD bias differences caused by the differences in NA and \u03c3 settings, by handling the light source E95% as a variable number. We have also derived the scopes (coverages) necessary for E95% to compensate gaps between existing units or recipes, and presented optical challenges with the E95% set for what we derived.", "With shrinking nodes, as the layout patterns are becoming more and more complicated, OPC accuracy and performance is becoming increasingly challenging. While we are trying to perfect our OPC script to have a clean output without weak points, in a real urgent tape-out scenario, often there will be weak points and we cannot afford the cost to run the OPC again with an updated OPC recipe. Naturally the post OPC repair becomes the only cost-effective choice. The paper studies and compares a few methods for the post OPC weak-points repair: the manual OPC repair flow and traditional repair flow based on the DRC commands. Here, we introduce a novel method based on the eqDRC commands, which are widely used in the design house but have never been used in the post OPC flow. We discuss how to apply the eqDRC into the post OPC repairs and demonstrate its advantages over the traditional methods.", "Key sustainability opportunities have been executed in support of corporate initiatives to reduce the environmental footprint and decrease the running cost of DUV light sources.

Process transfers between fabs occur quite often. One of the key assumptions made is that lithographic settings are equivalent from one fab to another and that the transfer is fluid. In some cases, that is far from the truth. Differences in tools can change the proximity effect seen in low k1 imaging processes. If you use model based optical proximity correction (MBOPC), then a model built in one fab will not work under the same conditions at another fab. This results in many wafers being patterned to try and match a baseline response. Even if matching is achieved, there is no guarantee that optimal lithographic responses are met. In this paper, we discuss the approach used to transfer and develop new lithographic processes and define MBOPC builds for the new lithographic process in Fab B which was transferred from a similar lithographic process in Fab A. By using PROLITHTM simulations to match OPC models for each level, minimal downtime in wafer processing was observed. Source Mask Optimization (SMO) was also used to optimize lithographic processes using novel inverse lithography techniques (ILT) to simultaneously optimize mask bias, depth of focus (DOF), exposure latitude (EL) and mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) for critical designs for each level.", "In the mask manufacturing process, the thickness and sidewall angle of mask are usually determined under the condition of vertical incidence. In fact, the incident angle of light on the mask plane is oblique, especially for the freeform source in source mask optimization (SMO). At this time, the thickness and sidewall angle of mask given by previous methods will not be optimal. This paper presents a method of optimizing mask parameters, which makes the transmittance and phase shift are more optimal for lithography process. In this paper, the influence of variations on mask parameters on lithography process is evaluated by the process window. And the process window corresponding to the optimal mask structure given by our method is larger than that of the original mask structure. The conclusion that the previous mask parameters are not the optimal for lithography process is demonstrated by the simulation results.", "With the extension of lithography simulations from low-NA to hyper-NA for immersion lithography and from scalar optics to vector optics including the polarization effect at source, mask, lens and resist film stack, inverse lithography technology (ILT) schemes based on the scalar imaging models which provide sufficient accuracy for NA less than 0.4, cannot track the whole process of polarized light propagation through the optical components of the lithography system rendering their impotence in hyper-NA immersion systems. In this paper, we address the mask synthesis problem by developing a optimization framework based on the vector imaging model fully describing the vector nature of electromagnetic fields in the aerial imaging formation and the stratified media model for the resist image, which is further reduced to a variational level-set based time-dependent model combining an internal energy term forcing the level set function close to a signed distance function and an extra energy term that drives the zero level set toward desired mask features minimizing the pattern difference between the printed wafer and the desired pattern, thereby optimizing the mask layout without the costly re- initialization procedure and ensuring the stability of the evolution of level surfaces. Represented by a partial differential equation, the time-dependent model is readily solved by finite difference schemes. Acceleration of over 30 times of the optimization procedure is achieved by computing convolution operations in the frequency domain with fast fourier transfrom (FFT) and the repeated usage of data, together with a 50% convergency performance improvement by means of applying Polak-Ribi`ere-Polyak (PRP) conjugate gradient (CG) to updating the normal velocity of the level-set function, which are merited by the experimental results.", "Due to the lithography demanding high performance in projection of semiconductor mask to wafer, the lens has to be almost free in spherical and coma aberration, thus, in situ optical testing for diagnosis of lens performance has to be established to verify the performance and to provide the suggesting for further improvement of the lens, before the lens has been build and integrated with light source. The measurement of modulation transfer function of critical dimension (CD) is main performance parameter to evaluate the line width of semiconductor platform fabricating ability for the smallest line width of producing tiny integrated circuits. Although the modulation transfer function (MTF) has been popularly used to evaluation the optical system, but in lithography, the contrast of each line-pair is in one dimension or two dimensions, analytically, while the lens stand along in the test bench integrated with the light source coherent or near coherent for the small dimension near the optical diffraction limit, the MTF is not only contributed by the lens, also by illumination of platform. In the study, the partial coherence modulation transfer function (PCMTF) for testing a lithography lens is suggested by measuring MTF in the high spatial frequency of in situ lithography lens, blended with the illumination of partial and in coherent light source. PCMTF can be one of measurement to evaluate the imperfect lens of lithography lens for further improvement in lens performance.", "This paper reviews the technical solutions for reduction optical photolithography systems based on the principle of obtaining a scaled-down object image. Dioptric reduction system design trends are discussed and applied technical solutions for building such systems are proposed. Genuine optical systems are offered which comply with the requirements mentioned above.", "We introduce a novel industrial grade 193nm continuous-wave laser light source for proximity mask-aligner lithography. A diode seed laser in master-oscillator power-amplification configuration is frequency-quadrupled using lithiumtriborate and potassium-uoro-beryllo-borate non-linear crystals. The large coherence-length of this monomodal laser is controlled by static and rotating shaped random diffusers. Beam shaping with imaging and non-imaging homogenizers realized with diffractive and refractive micro-optical elements is compared in simulation and measurement. We demonstrate resolution patterns offering resolutions <2 \u00b5m printed with proximity gaps of 20 \u00b5m.", "Scanner induced pattern shifts between layers are a large contributor to DRAM Bitline to Active overlay. One of the main root causes for this Pattern Shift non-Uniformity are lens aberrations. Currently measuring the Bitline to Active overlay requires a decap CDSEM method1. In this paper, an in-resist pattern shift uniformity metrology method is proposed which quantifies the main DRAM Bitline to Active overlay without the necessity to decap. We have designed a high transmission reticle (\u2265 60%) to measure the pattern shift non-uniformity between two dense gratings under the rotation angle of the Active layer in both cold and hot lens states. Each module on the reticle contains product-like features and a variety of metrology targets, i.e. alignment and overlay, such that the product-to-product and the productto- metrology pattern shift fingerprints can be measured. OPC is applied to enlarge the overlapping process windows of the metrology targets with respect to the product-like features.", "Inverse lithography is most commonly utilized to guide optimizing RET (Resolution Enhancement Technology) solution such as SRAF (Sub-resolution Assist Feature) placement and OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) edge dissection and fragmentation. Inverse lithography recipe often features an array of user-controlled parameters, which allow refined tuning of inverse solution maximizing for various common objectives such as common DOF, NILS, and pvband (process variability band). In practice, some test case shows that the inverse lithography engine can be perturbed to produce novel solution maximizing other unconventional objectives such as OPC solution\u2019s mask-friendliness, OPC convergence at extreme dense-to-iso transition, and multi-structure common focus range. However, the parameter tuning process can be time-consuming and requires expert knowledge of the tool. Also, parameters correlation to those objectives is often highly non-linear. All these reasons make inverse lithography recipe parameter tuning for unconventional objective a non-trivial task. Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been demonstrated to be effective at solving non-trivial optimization tasks such as SRAF rule optimization [1], OPC recipe optimization [2,3] and source mask optimization [4-6], and. Here we propose to use modified GA based engine for inverse lithography recipe optimization. We will show experimental results and discuss the benefits and challenges. We will demonstrate with three real test cases that this flow has a reasonable TAT and improved inverse lithography solutions.", "Patterning defects are considered primary killers for device yield and effective defect reduction is critical for semiconductor manufacturing. In the current work, a new positive tone development method is discussed to reduce defects for the 193 nm immersion lithography process. Photoresist develop processing is optimized via tuning of different process related parameters for complete coverage of the developer solution. Meanwhile, splash during development was minimized to achieve superior lithography performances and defect reduction. Lithographic depth of focus, critical dimension uniformity and line edge/width roughness were improved after 193 nm immersion exposure and etching for pattern transfer. Impact of the development method on defect reduction was also investigated. There was a 10x reduction in the bridging defect after patterning transfer for line/space patterning. The current work provides a strategy for positive tone development with significant defect reduction and improving our understanding of defect control from track related processing, which is of far-reaching significance for improvement in production yield for semiconductor manufacturing.", "Multi-patterning techniques with ArF immersion lithography is expected to continue as main solution for manufacturing IC chips. The reduction of laser downtime has great impact on the productivity of chipmakers. The laser downtime is closely related to the lifetime of consumable parts of the laser. Gigaphoton developed new laser modules, chamber and LNM (Line Narrowing Module) which have longer lifetime than current one. New chamber demonstrated 1.2 times longer lifetime than current chamber. New LNM demonstrated 1.8 times longer lifetime than current LNM. These new modules will help to reduce the downtime of the laser.", "In optical lithography, lens heating induced aberrations of a projection lens lead to degradation of imaging quality. In order to accurately compensate for thermal aberrations by integrated manipulators in projection lens, it is crucial to apply an accurate method for thermal aberration prediction. In this paper, an effective and accurate method for thermal aberration prediction is proposed. Double exponential model is simplified in respect of the timing of exposure tools, and particle filter is used to adjust the parameters of the double exponential model. Parameters of the simplified model are updated recursively pursuant to the aberration data measured during the exchange of wafers. The updated model is used to predict thermal aberrations of the lens during the following exposure of wafer. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by simulation of a projection lens for ArF lithography. Maximum root mean square (RMS) value of perdition error of thermal aberration under annular illumination and dipolar illumination are reduced by 68.3% and 76.1%, respectively. The proposed method is also of well adaptability to different types of aberration measurement error.", "As the semiconductor device dimension continues to shrink, the tolerance of Critical Dimension (CD) variation has been dramatically reduced for whole chip area to ensure the good uniformity of device functionality. Accordingly, the Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) model accuracy has become extremely important for controlling across-chip CD variation. The traditional method relying on CD Scanning Electron Microscope (CD-SEM) measurement data from synthetic patterns, such as dense line/space and isolated line in various pitch biases, for OPC model calibration is no longer sufficient for accurately projecting the complex patterns such as asymmetrical layout environments. Alternatively, the 2D extracted contours from SEM images associated with user-specified cutline algorithm to get the dimensional information of complex patterns have been incorporated for OPC modeling as well as process qualification [1-3]. In this work, the 2D contour extraction methodology was incorporated to extract more comprehensive CD information of complex features for OPC model calibration of 39nm half-pitch process layer. Together with the use of CD-SEM based CD, the model calibration via MASK2D and MASK3D model forms were conducted for accuracy comparison. The OPC model validation results demonstrated the contour-based gauges helps to improve the OPC model projection accuracy by 40~60% for asymmetrical features comparing to the traditional OPC calibration method.", "A new fabrication method of micro-lens arrays with element lens diameters of 20-50 \u03bcm was developed in the past research. In the method, epoxy micro-lens arrays are replicated using concave resist patterns as molds. In this paper, resist mold pattern profiles were investigated again in detail, and model curves to be fitted to pattern cross sections were looked over again. As a result, it was found that cross section curves of resist mold patterns were very accurately modeled by decomposing each curve into three parts of a central circular concave arc, a peripheral circular convex arc, and a tangential line connecting them. For this reason, using the new fitting curves, how parallel light rays incident in an element lens were refracted at the lens surface, and concentrated in a spot were investigated. It was clarified by the ray trace that parallel light rays were efficiently concentrated in a considerably small light spots by grace of the tangential line parts. Next, the ray trace results were compared with the experimental results. A micro-lens array fabricated under the same conditions was illuminated by a parallel light ray flux. As a result, the position where the traced rays were concentrated almost coincided with the position obtained experimentally. The diameters of concentrated light spots estimated by the ray trace also almost coincided with the actually observed ones. Thus, optical characteristics of microlens arrays fabricated by the new method were adequately qualified. The new method will be useful.", "The ever increasing pattern densities and design complexities make the tuning of optical proximity correction (OPC) recipes very challenging. One known method for tuning is genetic algorithm (GA). Previously GA has been demonstrated to fine tune OPC recipes in order to achieve better results for possible 1D and 2D geometric concerns like bridging and pinching. This method, however, did not take into account the impact of excess segmentation on downstream operations like fracturing and mask writing.\nThis paper introduces a general methodology to significantly reduce the number of excess edges in the OPC output, thus reducing the number of flashes generated at fracture and subsequently the write time at mask build. GA is used to reduce the degree of unwarranted segmentation while ensuring good OPC quality. An Objective Function (OF) is utilized to ensure quality convergence and process-variation (PV) plus an additional weighed factor to reduce clustered edge count.\nThe technique is applied to 14nm metal layer OPC recipes in order to identify excess segmentation and to produce a modified recipe that significantly reduces these segments. OPC output file sizes is shown to be reduced by 15% or more and overall edge count is shown to be reduced by 10% or more. At the same time overall quality of the OPC recipe is shown to be maintained via OPC Verification (OPCV) results.", "In this paper the bias table models and rules-based correction strategies for the wafer scale nanoimprint lithography (NIL) technology are addressed using complete Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) characterizations. This replication technology is known to induce Critical Dimension (CD) variations between the master and the imprint, due to polymer shrinkage, soft stamp deformation or thermal expansion. The bias between the former and final object follows peculiar rules which are specific to this process. To emphasis these singularities, Critical Dimension (CD) uniformity analyses are performed onto 200 mm wafers imprinted with the HERCULES\u00ae NIL equipment platform. Dedicated masters were manufactured which have horizontal and vertical line arrays, with local densities ranging from 0.1 to 0.9, with a minimum CD of 250 nm. The silicon masters were manufactured with 248 optical lithography and dry etching and treated with an anti-sticking layer from Arkema. CD measurements were made for the master and the replicates on 48 well selected features to build an interpolation. The data revealed that the CD evolutions can be modelled by polynomial functions with respect to the density, the CD and the orientation (vertical or horizontal) on the GDS. Finally the focus is made on the dependence of the design rules with respect to the position on the master, and it opens the discussion on the strategies for efficient wafer scale corrections for the nanoimprint soft stamp technologies.", "This paper describes a rigorous yet flexible standard cell place-and-route flow that is used to quantify block-level power, performance, and area trade-offs driven by two unique cell architectures and their associated design rule differences. The two architectures examined in this paper differ primarily in their use of different power-distribution-networks to achieve the desired circuit performance for high-performance logic designs. The paper shows the importance of incorporating block-level routability experiments in the early phases of design-technology co-optimization by reviewing a series of routing trials that explore different aspects of the technology definition. Since the electrical and physical parameters leading to critical process assumptions and design rules are unique to specific integration schemes and design objectives, it is understood that the goal of this work is not to promote one cell-architecture over another, but rather to convey the importance of exploring critical trade-offs long before the process details of the technology node are finalized to a point where a process design kit can be published.", "The targeted 5nm and below technology node at IMEC has been defined by poly pitch 42nm and metal pitch 21nm. Compared to the previous node the CPP [1] remains the same and only the metal pitch is scaled down, which implies that direct pitch scaling will not lead to the most optimum scaling. Therefore, Standard Cell (SDC) track height reduction is a knob that can be used to achieve advances in the scaling of the technology to preserve Moore\u2019s law. Here we present some of the options for the standard cell design that may enable this advance technology node and will require scaling boosters as Design-Technology co-optimization (DTCO).", "Multi-bit flip-ops (MBFFs) are widely used in modern circuit designs because of their lower power consumption and smaller footprint. However, conventional MBFFs have routability issues due to the dense intra-cell connections. Since many horizontal connections are populated in the typical MBFF layouts, metal-2 (M2) tracks are highly occupied inside the cell. Accordingly, routers cannot leverage the M2 tracks for inter-cell connections. The conventional MBFFs also show a limited impact on the cell area reduction. Since the cell area saving of an MBFF mainly comes from the clock driver sharing, the layouts of other ip-op modules remain almost the same. In this paper, we propose a compact MBFF with metal-less clock routing and smaller height implementation. To achieve a sparse population of M2 routing tracks, we vertically place MBFF modules and interconnect them using the poly layer. As a result, the wire length of M2 layer inside a cell is significantly reduced. We also propose the smaller cell height implementation for compact MBFF layouts. Assuming the default standard cell height of 9 tracks, we present a 6-track MBFF implementation and the glue logic which makes legal cell placement with the 9-track logic cells. Experiments with a few test circuits show that the number of routing grids having congestion overflow is reduced by 16% and 73%, on average, compared to the single-bit flip-op and conventional MBFF based designs, respectively. Total cell area is also reduced by 8% and 2%, on average, compared to the single-bit flip-op and conventional MBFF based designs, respectively.", "Standard cell track height scaling has been identified as an option to provide significant area savings. A direct consequence of track height reduction is that the width of the power rails needs to be reduced to accommodate patterning constraints as well as leave sufficient tracks for routing. Narrower power rails are highly resistive, reducing the headroom near an operating cell due to IR drop, which is not acceptable. For example, a 20% performance loss is observed due to a 10% supply voltage drop. To worsen the situation of IR drop, a slowdown in CPP scaling and newer metallization options are making the power rail highly sensitive and its design choice is a widely debated topic in the industry. Therefore, we propose an approach to define the power rail specifications and some feasible technology solutions to solve the power grid bottleneck.", "A pattern matching and rule-based polygon clustering methodology with DFM scoring is proposed to detect decomposition-induced manufacturability detractors and fix the layout designs prior to manufacturing. A pattern matcher scans the layout for pre-characterized patterns from a library. If a pattern were detected, rule-based clustering identifies the neighboring polygons that interact with those captured by the pattern. Then, DFM scores are computed for the possible layout fixes: the fix with the best score is applied. The proposed methodology was applied to two 20nm products with a chip area of 11 mm2 on the metal 2 layer. All the hotspots were resolved. The number of DFM spacing violations decreased by 7-15%.", "At advanced process nodes, especially at sub-28nm technology, pin accessibility and routability of standard cells has become one of the most challenging design issues due to the limited router tracks and the increased pin density. If this issue can\u2019t be found and resolved during the cell design stage, the pin access problem will be very difficult to be fixed in implementation stage and will make the low efficiency for routing.\nIn this paper, we will introduce a holistic approach for the pin accessibility scoring and routability analysis. For accessibility, the systematic calculator which assigns score for each pin will search the available access points, consider the surrounded router layers, basic design rule and allowed via geometry. Based on the score, the \u201cbad\u201d pins can be found and modified. On pin routability analysis, critical pin points (placing via on this point would lead to failed via insertion) will be searched out for either layout optimization guide or set as OBS for via insertion blocking. By using this pin routability and pin access analysis flow, we are able to improve the library quality and performance.", "The semiconductor industry has adopted multi-patterning techniques to manage the delay in the extreme ultraviolet lithography technology. During the design process of double-patterning lithography layout masks, two polygons are assigned to different masks if their spacing is less than the minimum printable spacing. With these additional design constraints, it is very difficult to find experienced layout-design engineers who have a good understanding of the circuit to manually optimize the mask layers in order to minimize color-induced circuit variations. In this work, we investigate the impact of double-patterning lithography on analog circuits and provide quantitative analysis for our designers to select the optimal mask to minimize the circuit\u2019s mismatch. To overcome the problem and improve the turn-around time, we proposed our smart \u201canchoring\u201d placement technique to optimize mask decomposition for analog circuits. We have developed a software prototype that is capable of providing anchoring markers in the layout, allowing industry standard tools to perform automated color decomposition process.", "Via failure has always been a significant yield detractor caused by random and systematic defects. Introducing redundant vias or via bars into the design can alleviate the problem significantly [1] and has, therefore, become a standard DFM procedure [2]. Applying rule-based via bar insertion to convert millions of via squares to via bar rectangles, in all possible places where enough room could be predicted, is an efficient methodology to maximize the redundancy rate. However, inserting via bars can result in lithography hotspots. A Pattern Manufacturability (PATMAN) model is proposed, to maximize the Redundant Via Insertion (RVI) rate in a reasonable runtime, while insuring lithography friendly insertion based on the accumulated DFM learnings during the yield ramp.", "The design and optimization of highly nonlinear and complex processes like plasma etching is challenging and timeconsuming. Significant effort has been devoted to creating plasma profile simulators to facilitate the development of etch recipes. Nevertheless, these simulators are often difficult to use in practice due to the large number of unknown parameters in the plasma discharge and surface kinetics of the etch material, the dependency of the etch rate on the evolving front profile, and the disparate length scales of the system. Here, we expand on the development of a previously published, data informed, Bayesian approach embodied in the platform RODEo (Recipe Optimization for Deposition and Etching). RODEo is used to predict etch rates and etch profiles over a range of powers, pressures, gas flow rates, and gas mixing ratios of an CF4/Ar gas chemistry. Three examples are shown: (1) etch rate predictions of an unknown material \u201cX\u201d using simulated experiments for a CF4/Ar chemistry, (2) etch rate predictions of SiO2 in a Plasma-Therm 790 RIE reactor for a CF4/Ar chemistry, and (3) profile prediction using level set methods.", "In recent years, various methods for hotspot detection during optical proximity correction (OPC) verification have been studied. They try to predict hotspots by analyzing optical features of aerial image such as peak intensity. However, detection accuracy in these conventional methods is still not sufficient. We cannot distinguish hotspots from nonhotspots by only focusing on aerial image of hotspot because one often becomes hotspot and the other does not despite of the same aerial images. On the other hand, optical features of pattern next to the hotspot are different even in such a case. Therefore, optical features which are extracted from surrounding patterns of hotspot are one of the promising metrics for hotspot detection. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect hotspots more accurately. A new metric, Surrounding Optical Feature (SOF), is introduced. SOF indicates optical features which are extracted from surrounding pattern of the evaluated pattern. The optical feature includes critical dimension (CD), normalized image log-slope (NILS), integral intensity, peak intensity of optical image. The proposed method consists of two steps. In step 1, appropriate SOF is extracted by using training data. In step 2, OPC verification is carried out with the SOF. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed in the experimental comparisons.", "At advanced and mainstream process nodes (e.g., 7nm, 14nm, 22nm, and 55nm process nodes), lithography hotspots can exist in layouts of integrated circuits even if the layouts pass design rule checking (DRC). Existence of lithography hotspots in a layout can cause manufacturability issues, which can result in yield losses of manufactured integrated circuits. In order to detect lithography hotspots existing in physical layouts, pattern matching (PM) algorithms and commercial PM tools have been developed. However, there are still needs to use DRC tools to perform PM operations. In this paper, we propose a PM synthesis methodology, which uses a continuous refinement technique, for the automatic synthesis of a given lithography hotspot pattern into a DRC deck, which consists of layer operation commands, so that an equivalent PM operation can be performed by executing the synthesized deck with the use of a DRC tool. Note that the proposed methodology can deal with not only exact patterns, but also range patterns. Also, lithography hotspot patterns containing multiple layers can be processed. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can accurately and efficiently detect lithography hotspots in physical layouts.", "Finding the true on-product hot spots (patterning defects) by High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) inspection tools is increasingly challenging as the process window margin shrinks. It is a common practice nowadays to use Optical Rule Check (ORC) results by computation lithography to provide \u201ccare areas\u201d to increase the signal to noise level of the inspection tool, thus improving the detection accuracy. The care area defined by the traditional method of contour-based process window checks may not be good enough. There are cases where real yield killers were not caught by contour-based checks, resulting in missing errors during wafer inspection as well. In this paper, we expand the traditional process window checks to a broader lithographic spectrum. The method allows us to utilize additional limiters such as max intensity, contrast, and NILS checks in combination with normal CD-based checks such as bridge, pinch, or process window bands to achieve higher accuracy in failure locations. This compound check will be trained using existing on product failure data obtained from low and high resolution wafer inspection as well as eTest and yield data. The combination of contour and intensity-based checks is demonstrated to be more effective in capturing the wafer hot spots for new products. The various usage models of such enhanced ORC will also be discussed.", "Advances in pattern-based layout tools enable automatic and rapid capture, tailoring, creation, classification, and comparison/matching (accurate or fuzzy) of large quantities of patterns. Applications of such tools have significantly improved traditional script- or manual- based approaches, and have produced impressive results in production OPC and mask work. In this work, we introduce into NXP mask preparation a flow with pattern-matching-assisted mask data inspection solution, employing Cadence Pattern Analysis (CPA) tool. We also engage in CPA-facilitated creation of pattern libraries to achieve more comprehensive results in more automatic ways than what could be realized with traditional approaches, and utilize these patterns to accelerate OPC tuning, monitoring, and optimization.", "In order to maintain the scaling trend in logic technology node progression, imec technology nodes started heavily utilizing design technology co-optimization (DTCO) on top of loosen pitch scaling trend to mitigate the burden from steep cost increase and yield challenge. Scaling boosters are adopted to enable DTCO process on top of patterning near its cliff to mitigate the cost increase. As the technology node further proceeds, DTCO also starts facing its cliff, and system technology co-optimization (STCO) is introduced to assist pitch and DTCO scaling to bridge 2-D IC technology to evolutionary technology options such as MRAM, 2.5-D heterogeneous integration, 3-D integration and 3-D IC. EUV is used to further assist pitch and DTCO scaling to maintain low cost with higher yield and faster turn-around-time (TAT). EUV single patterning, multiple patterning and high-NA EUV are considered on top of DTCO and STCO landscape to define imec technology nodes.", "Low throughput has been a critical issue in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) patterning due to the difficulty in increasing light source power. This limitation has driven the need for photoresists with better throughput which unfortunately come with higher line edge roughness (LER). In this work, the possibility of relaxing LER requirements for metal layer patterned by EUV lithography (EUVL) is studied. Single patterning and litho-etch litho-etch (LELE) patterning with EUVL are considered. To assess the impact of LER on design yield, analytical and simulation based modeling approaches are developed, which consider the LER induced metal wire shorts/opens and the enhanced time dependent dielectrics breakdown (TDDB) for metal wires with different geometries. The impact of LER on wire delay is studied by Elmore\u2019s delay model.", "Self-Aligned-Multi-Pattering (SAMP) played an important role in extending Moore\u2019s law over the past years especially in advanced technology nodes beyond 20nm. SAMP was tackled using several approaches, the main and most commonly used approaches are SADP with Spacer-Is-Mask (SIM) and SADP with Spacer-Is-Dielectric (SID). The first approach SADP-SIM is most commonly used in devices layer with unidirectional lines. The second approach SADP-SID is now a common approach applied in metal layers with thigh pitches especially in 7nm and 5nm technologies where the original target patterns are decomposed into a Mandrel mask and Cut Mask. The Mandrel mask is printed first using DUV 193i lithography process, then side walls are grown on both sides of the printed Mandrel patterns, and then a Cut/Block mask is printed to define target\u2019s intended tip-to-tip spacing. The summation of side walls and Cut/Blocks act as an etchblocking layer to the regions they are covering, in another words, trenches are grown in all areas that are not covered by side walls nor cut/blocks. A complementary process for SADP-SID is the filling process, where unidirectional design, consists of aligned target patterns, are accommodated into aligned tracks. The aligned tracks are alternately assigned as Mandrel and non-Mandrels tracks. The Cut/Block defines a gap within the target and accordingly define target\u2019s tip-totip spacing. The spacing constraints between target\u2019s line ends and tip-to-tip spacing are translated into spacing constrains between Cut/Blocks, and based on place and route style, the density of Cut/Blocks mask is defined. Usually, in real-life designs Cut/Blocks mask density is high and comes with tight spacing constrains. The challenge with printing a cut/Blocks mask with such tight constraints and spacing rules among Cut/Blocks shapes, mandated LEn Cut/Blocks Masks with 2, 3 and sometimes 4 masks, based on how close are the cut shapes to each other. Recently, a Selective- Etching SADP-SID approach was introduced in advanced nodes, where Cut/Blocks are divided into two types, Mandrel Cut/Blocks that cut only Mandrel tracks, and non-Mandrel Cut/Blocks that cut only non-Mandrel tracks, and hence these two cut/Blocks masks can overlap each other and this significantly mitigates spacing constrains between the two Cut/Block masks.\nIn this work we present a comparison between manufacturing flows of traditional approach SADP-SID and Selective- Etching SADP-SID, and how can the process definition of each approach affects spacing constraints between Cut/Blocks patterns, OPC masks, and accordingly, affect the final manufactured patterns quality quantified based on Edge- Placement-Error (EPE) and Process Variation Band (PVBand).", "Printing cut mask in SAMP (Self Aligned Multi Patterning) is very challenging at advanced nodes. One of the proposed solutions is to print the cut shapes selectively. Which means the design is decomposed into mandrel tracks, Mandrel cuts and non-Mandrel cuts. The mandrel and non-Mandrel cuts are mutually independent which results in relaxing spacing constrains and as a consequence more dense metal lines. In this paper, we proposed the manufacturing flow of selective etching process. The results are quantified in terms of measuring PVBand, EPE and the number of hard bridging and pinching across the layout.", "As the minimum feature size continues to shrink down, the interconnect resistance is getting more important. The wire RC delay now often limits the overall chip performance. In this paper, we address a wire width optimization in self-aligned double patterning (SADP) process, where wire widening and double via insertion are considered simultaneously to minimize the total wire delay of timing critical paths. For each of the wires on the critical paths, the candidate directions to which we enlarge the wire is identified while design rules are taken into account. Each candidate direction is then evaluated in terms of the potential wire delay reduction. We finally select an optimal widening configuration by reducing the problem into a minimum weight independent set (MWIS), which is solved by using an integer learning programming (ILP) solver. Experiments are conducted for a few test circuits; wire resistance is reduced by 22.4%, on average, which allows the clock period to be reduced by 12.5%.", "Line patterning, in via first dual damascene approach, is conditioned by vias density: bottom anti\u2013reflective coating (BARC), used to minimize thin film interference effects by reducing reflected light, and photoresist reflow into vias, leading to materials thickness variation, and so to unwanted modification of metal lines critical dimension (CD), due to local reflectivity change and to swing effect. Aim of the work is to assess CD variations to be expected at device level when applying via first integration scheme, in order to compensate them, where and when feasible, or to setup restrictions to vias density at design level, forbidding critical configurations that might lead to patterning failures. The paper presents an experimental characterization of metal line CD variation as a function of vias density based on the study of a test pattern, designed to explore a wide variety of vias and metals respective configurations, and investigates different approaches to model and predict CD deviations from expected targets. Vias densities, or their convolution with specific kernels, are extracted using conventional design rule check (DRC) tools, and are used as predictors to model metal lines CD variation behavior. Simple via density computation is not able to capture the effect, so we propose a flow, based on machine learning artificial neural network algorithms, able to predict metal line width variations to be expected on product devices as a function of the vias pattern underneath.", "Sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) have become an integral part of low-k lithography\u2019s resolution enhancement techniques (RET). Gradually maturing EUV technology indicates that SRAF insertion might be necessary for 5nm technology nodes and below.\nIn mask synthesis flows, during the correction step, an SRAF print avoidance (SPA) algorithm is relying on detection of printing predicted by model based simulation. In this paper we are presenting a cross-MEEF based SPA approach that offers elimination of SRAF printing while minimizing impact on process window.", "As the IC technology node moves forward, critical dimension becomes smaller and smaller, which brings huge challenge to IC manufacturing. Lithography is one of the most important steps during the whole manufacturing process and litho hotspots become a big source of yield detractors. Thus tuning lithographic recipes to cover a big range of litho hotspots is very essential to yield enhancing. During early technology developing stage, foundries only have limited customer layout data for recipe tuning. So collecting enough patterns is significant for process optimization. After accumulating enough patterns, a general way to treat them is not precise and applicable. Instead, an approach to scoring these patterns could provide a priority and reference to address different patterns more effectively. For example, the weakest group of patterns could be applied the most limited specs to ensure process robustness. This paper presents a new method of creation of real design alike patterns of multiple layers based on design rules using Layout Schema Generator (LSG) utility and a pattern scoring flow using Litho-friendly Design (LFD) and Pattern Matching. Through LSG, plenty of new unknown patterns could be created for further exploration. Then, litho simulation through LFD and topological matches by using Pattern Matching is applied on the output patterns of LSG. Finally, lithographical severity, printability properties and topological distribution of every pattern are collected. After a statistical analysis of pattern data, every pattern is given a relative score representing the pattern\u2019s yield detracting level. By sorting the output pattern score tables, weak patterns could be filtered out for further research and process tuning. This pattern generation and scoring flow is demonstrated on 28nm logic technology node. A weak pattern library is created and scored to help improve recipe coverage of litho hotspots and enhance the reliability of process.", "The goal of a foundry partner is to deliver high quality silicon product to its customers on time. There is an assumed trust that the silicon will yield, function and perform as expected when the design fits all the sign-off criteria. The use of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks is very common today and provides the customer with pre-qualified and optimized functions for their design thus shortening the design cycle. There are many methods by which an IP Block can be generated and placed within layout. Even with the most careful methods and following of guidelines comes the responsibility of sign-off checking. A foundry needs to detect where these IP Blocks have been placed and look for any violations. This includes DRC clean modifications to the IP Block which may or may not be intentional.\nUsing a pattern-based approach to detect all IP Blocks used provides the foundry advanced capabilities to analyze them further for any kind of changes which could void the OPC and process window optimizations. Having any changes in an IP Block could cause functionality changes or even failures. This also opens the foundry to legal and cost issues while at the same time forcing re-spins of the design.\nIn this publication, we discuss the methodology we have employed to avoid process issues and tape-out errors while at the same time reduce our manual work and improve the turnaround time. We are also able to use our pattern analysis to improve our OPC optimizations when modifications are encountered which have not been seen before.", "As integrated circuits (IC) technology moves forward, manufacturing process is facing more and more challenges. Optical proximity correction (OPC) has been playing an important role in the whole manufacturing process. In the deep sub-micron technology, OPC engineers not only need to guarantee the layout designs to be manufacturable but also take a more precise control of the critical patterns to ensure a high performance circuit. One of the tasks that would like to be performed is the consistency checking as the identical patterns under identical context should have identical OPC results in theory, like SRAM regions. Consistency checking is essentially a technique of repeated patterns identification, extraction and derived patterns (i.e. OPC results) comparison. The layout passing to the OPC team may not have enough design hierarchical information either because the original designs may have undergone several layout processing steps or some other unknown reasons. This paper presents a generic way to identify and extract repeated layout structures in SRAM regions purely based on layout pattern analysis through Calibre Pattern Matching and Calibre equation-based DRC (eqDRC). Without Pattern Matching and eqDRC, it will take lots of effort to manually get it done by trial and error, it is almost impossible to automate the pattern analysis process. Combining Pattern Matching and eqDRC opens a new way to implement this flow. The repeated patterns must have some fundamental features for measurement of pitches in the horizontal and vertical direction separately by Calibre eqDRC and meanwhile can be a helper to generate some anchor points which will be the starting points for Pattern Matching to capture patterns. The informative statistical report from the pattern search tells the match counts individually for each patterns captured. Experiment shows that this is a smart way of identifying and extracting repeated structures effectively. The OPC results are the derived layers on these repeated structures, by running pattern search using design layers as pattern layers and OPC results as marker layers, it is an easy job to compare the consistency.", "A design usually goes through several versions until achieving a most successful one. These changes between versions are not a complete substitution but a continual improvement, either fixing the known issues of its prior versions (engineering change order) or a more optimized design substitution of a portion of the design. On the manufacturing side, process engineers care more about the design pattern changes because any new pattern occurrence may be a killer of the yield. An effective and efficient way to narrow down the diagnosis scope appeals to the engineers. What is the best approach of comparing two layouts? A direct overlay of two layouts may not always work as even though most of the design instances will be kept in the layout from version to version, the actual placements may be different. An alternative way, pattern based layout comparison, comes to play. By expanding this application, it makes it possible to transfer the learning in one cycle to another and accelerate the process of failure analysis.\nThis paper presents a solution to compare two layouts by using Calibre DRC and Pattern Matching. The key step in this flow is layout decomposition. In theory, with a fixed pattern size, a layout can always be decomposed into limited number of patterns by moving the pattern center around the layout, the number is limited but may be huge if the layout is not processed smartly! A mathematical answer is not what we are looking for but an engineering solution is more desired. Layouts must be decomposed into patterns with physical meaning in a smart way. When a layout is decomposed and patterns are classified, a pattern library with unique patterns inside is created for that layout. After individual pattern libraries for each layout are created, run pattern comparison utility provided by Calibre Pattern Matching to compare the pattern libraries, unique patterns will come out for each layout. This paper illustrates this flow in details and demonstrates the advantage of combining Calibre DRC and Calibre Pattern Matching.", "As technology advances, escalating layout design complexity and chip size make defect inspection becomes more challenging than ever before. The YE (Yield Enhancement) engineers are seeking for an efficient strategy to ensure accuracy without suffering running time. A smart way is to set different resolutions for different pattern structures, for examples, logic pattern areas have a higher scan resolution while the dummy areas have a lower resolution, SRAM area may have another different resolution. This can significantly reduce the scan processing time meanwhile the accuracy does not suffer. Due to the limitation of the inspection equipment, the layout must be processed in order to output the Care Area marker in line with the requirement of the equipment, for instance, the marker shapes must be rectangle and the number of the rectangle shapes should be as small as possible. The challenge is how to select the different Care Areas by pattern structures, merge the areas efficiently and then partition them into pieces of rectangle shapes. This paper presents a solution based on Calibre DRC and Pattern Matching. Calibre equation-based DRC is a powerful layout processing engine and Calibre Pattern Matching\u2019s automated visual capture capability enables designers to define these geometries as layout patterns and store them in libraries which can be re-used in multiple design layouts. Pattern Matching simplifies the description of very complex relationships between pattern shapes efficiently and accurately. Pattern matching\u2019s true power is on display when it is integrated with normal DRC deck. In this application of defects inspection, we first run Calibre DRC to get rule based Care Area then use Calibre Pattern Matching\u2019s automated pattern capture capability to capture Care Area shapes which need a higher scan resolution with a tune able pattern halo. In the pattern matching step, when the patterns are matched, a bounding box marker will be output to identify the high resolution area. The equation-based DRC and Pattern Matching effectively work together for different scan phases.", "Memory is a critical component in today's system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Static random-access memory (SRAM) blocks are assembled by combining intellectual property (IP) blocks that come from SRAM libraries developed and certified by the foundries for both functionality and a specific process node. Customers place these SRAM IP in their designs, adjusting as necessary to achieve DRC-clean results. However, any changes a customer makes to these SRAM IP during implementation, whether intentionally or in error, can impact yield and functionality. Physical verification of SRAM has always been a challenge, because these blocks usually contain smaller feature sizes and spacing constraints compared to traditional logic or other layout structures. At advanced nodes, critical dimension becomes smaller and smaller, until there is almost no opportunity to use optical proximity correction (OPC) and lithography to adjust the manufacturing process to mitigate the effects of any changes. The smaller process geometries, reduced supply voltages, increasing process variation, and manufacturing uncertainty mean accurate SRAM physical verification results are not only reaching new levels of difficulty, but also new levels of criticality for design success. In this paper, we explore the use of pattern matching to create an SRAM verification flow that provides both accurate, comprehensive coverage of the required checks and visual output to enable faster, more accurate error debugging. Our results indicate that pattern matching can enable foundries to improve SRAM manufacturing yield, while allowing designers to benefit from SRAM verification kits that can shorten the time to market.", "Along with process improvement and integrated circuit (IC) design complexity increased, failure rate caused by optical getting higher in the semiconductor manufacture. In order to enhance chip quality, optical proximity correction (OPC) plays an indispensable rule in the manufacture industry. However, OPC, includes model creation, correction, simulation and verification, is a bottleneck from design to manufacture due to the multiple iterations and advanced physical behavior description in math. Thus, this paper presented a pattern-based design technology co-optimization (PB-DTCO) flow in cooperation with OPC to find out patterns which will negatively affect the yield and fixed it automatically in advance to reduce the run-time in OPC operation.\nPB-DTCO flow can generate plenty of test patterns for model creation and yield gaining, classify candidate patterns systematically and furthermore build up bank includes pairs of match and optimization patterns quickly. Those banks can be used for hotspot fixing, layout optimization and also be referenced for the next technology node. Therefore, the combination of PB-DTCO flow with OPC not only benefits for reducing the time-to-market but also flexible and can be easily adapted to diversity OPC flow.", "As the semiconductor industry enters 20 nm node and beyond, design restrictions and process complexity lay stress on the development for a new technology node. This paper introduces a hybrid hotspot library building method based on simultaneous optical and geometry analysis, which could help explore design rule optimization and enhance cycle time at early stage for new node development. Lithography simulation results verify the accuracy of this method. This method provide a feasible way to build up a preliminary Design Rule Checking (DRC) library even before process-freezing.", "A pattern transfer study was conducted to monitor the evolution of roughness in sub-10 nm half-pitch lines generated by the directed self-assembly (DSA) of a high-chi, silicon-containing block copolymer, poly(4-trimethylsilylstyrene)-block-poly(4-methoxystyrene). Unbiased roughness measurements were used to characterize the roughness of the structures before and after pattern transfer into silicon nitride. Parameters of the reactive ion etch process used as a dry development were systematically modified to minimize undesired line walking created by the DSA pre-pattern and to determine their impacts on roughness. The results of this study indicate that an optimized dry development can mitigate the effects of pre-pattern inhomogeneity, and that both dry development and pattern transfer steps effect the roughness of the final structures.", "Multi-layer patterning schemes involve the use of Silicon containing Anti-Reflective Coating (SiARC) films for their anti-reflective properties. Patterning transfer completion requires complete and selective removal of SiARC which is very difficult due to its high silicon content (>40%). Typically, SiARC removal is accomplished through a non-selective etch during the pattern transfer process using fluorine containing plasmas, or an ex-situ wet etch process using hydrofluoric acid is employed to remove the residual SiARC, post pattern transfer. Using a non-selective etch may result in profile distortion or wiggling, due to distortion of the underlying organic layer. The drawbacks of using wet etch process for SiARC removal are increased overall processing time and the need for additional equipment. Many applications may involve patterning of active structures in a poly-Si layer with an underlying oxide stopping layer. In such applications, SiARC removal selective to oxide using a wet process may prove futile. Removing SiARC selectively to SiO2 using a dry etch process is also challenging, due to similarity in the nature of chemical bonds (Si \u2013 O) in the two materials.\nIn this work, we present highly selective etching of SiARC, in a plasma driven by a surface wave radial line slot antenna. The first step in the process involves an in-situ modification of the SiARC layer in O2 plasma followed by selective etching in a NF3/H2 plasma. Surface treatment in O2 plasma resulted in enhanced etching of the SiARC layer. For the right processing conditions, in-situ NF3/H2 dry etch process demonstrated selectivity values greater than 15:1 with respect to SiO2. The etching chemistry, however, was sensitive to NF3:H2 gas ratio. For dilute NF3 in H2, no SiARC etching was observed. Presumably, this is due to the deposition of ammonium fluorosilicate layer that occurs for dilute NF3/H2 plasmas. Additionally, challenges involved in selective SiARC removal (selective to SiO2, organic and Si layers) post pattern transfer, in a multi-layer structure will be discussed.", "Interest in atomic layer etching (ALE) has surged recently because it offers several advantages over continuous or quasicontinuous plasma etching. These benefits include (1) independent control of ion energy, ion flux, and radical flux, (2) flux-independent etch rate that mitigates the iso-dense loading effects, and (3) ability to control the etch rate with atomic or nanoscale precision. In addition to these benefits, we demonstrate an area-selective etching for maskless lithography as a new frontier of ALE. In this paper, area-selective etching refers to the confinement of etching into the specific areas of the substrate. The concept of area-selective etching originated during our studies on quasi-ALE of silicon nitride which consists of sequential exposure of silicon nitride to hydrogen and fluorinated plasma. The findings of our studies reported in this paper suggest that it may be possible to confine the etching into specific areas of silicon nitride without using any mask by replacing conventional hydrogen plasma with a localized source of hydrogen ions.", "Year after year, the semiconductor industry overcomes a tremendous amount of technical challenges to satisfy Moore\u2019s law. Through innovative device architectures, smart design, new integration and patterning concepts, better tools and new materials, the industry has successfully reached the 7nm technology node. Both design and patterning options are identified and the high volume manufacturing readiness is expected end of 2018. Today, the industry is preparing for the 5nm technology node (N5) while research centers start identifying and exploring the different patterning options for the 3nm technology node. The former targets a Metal 2 Pitch (M2P) of 32nm and a Contacted Poly Pitch (CPP) of 42nm while the latter aims for a M2P of 24nm and a CPP of 32nm. At such tight metal pitches and in view of the continuous progress in EUV tool performance, a single print EUV lithography is considered as a potential patterning option for N5 to pattern critical Back-End-Of-Line (BEOL) layers such as block, via and unidirectional metal lines. However, without the emergence of improved EUV photoresist (PR) platform that meets requirements for resolution, line edge roughness and sensitivity, we can expect a very limited available PR budget for pattern transfer (between 12nm and 30nm), an increase of defects such as bridging or line interruptions and finally a degradation of the sidewall roughness. These will contribute to the total CD variation and consume an important part of the overall Edge Placement Error (EPE) budget. Hence, actual patterning methods used to smooth and transfer down the PR pattern must be significantly improved and new solutions must be explored to enable the emergence of advanced technologies. In this work, we explore different post-lithography methods to overcome challenges related to EUV-based patterning at tight pitches. Both chemically amplified PR and metal-based PR are considered and the performance of the different approaches are evaluated step-by-step using top down SEM imaging, cross-section SEM and 3D-AFM. Finally, we complete the study showing Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis that help to understand how the roughness is distributed in the frequency domain for the different studied methods.", "In this work, we present our recent achievements on the integration and transfer etching of a novel silicon-containing high-\u03c7 block copolymer for lines/spaces applications. Developed carbo-silane BCPs are synthesized under industrial conditions and present periodicities as low as 14 nm. A full directed self-assembly by graphoepitaxy process is shown using standard photolithography stacks and all processes are performed on 300 mm wafer compatible tools. Specific plasma processes are developed to isolate perpendicular lamellae and sub-12 nm features are finally transferred into silicon substrates. The quality of the final BCP hard mask (CDU, LWR, LER) are also investigated. Finally, thanks to the development of dedicated neutral layers and top-coats allowing perpendicular orientations, it was possible to investigate plasma etching experiments on full-sheets at 7 nm resolution, opening the way to the integration of these polymers in chemoepitaxy stacks.", "Historically, the on-product overlay performance close to the wafer edge is lagging with respect to the inner part of the wafer. The reason for this is that wafer processing is less controlled close to the wafer edge as opposed to the rest of the wafer. It is generally accepted that Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of stressed layers that cause wafer warp, wafer table contamination, Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP), and Reactive Ion Etch (RIE) may deteriorate the overlay performance and/or registration close to the wafer edge. For the N7 technology node and beyond, it is anticipated that the tight on-product overlay specification is required across the full wafer which includes the edge region.\nIn this work, we highlight one contributor that may negatively impact the on-product overlay performance, namely the etch step. The focus will be mainly on the wafer edge region but the remaining part of the wafer is considered as well. Three use-cases are examined: multiple Litho-Etch steps (LEn), contact hole layer etch, and the copper dual damascene etch. We characterize the etch contribution by considering the overlay measurement after resist development inspect (ADI) and after etch inspect (AEI). We show that the Yieldstar diffraction based overlay (\u03bcDBO) measurements can be utilized to characterize the etch contribution to the overlay budget. The effects of target asymmetry as well as overlay shifts are considered and compared with SEM measurements.\nBased on the results above, we propose a control solution aiming to reduce or even eliminate the delta between ADI and AEI. By doing so, target/mark to device offsets due to etch might be avoided.", "While the semiconductor industry is almost ready for high-volume manufacturing of the 7 nm technology node, research centers are defining and troubleshooting the patterning options for the 5 nm technology node (N5) and below. The target dimension for imec\u2019s N5 BEOL applications is 20-24 nm Metal Pitch (MP), which requires Self-Aligned multiple (Double/Quadruple/Octuple) Patterning approaches (SAxP) in combination with EUV or immersion lithography at 193 nm. There are numerous technical challenges to enable gratings at the hard mask level such as good uniformity across wafer, low line edge/width roughness (LER/LWR), large process window, and all of this at low cost. An even greater challenge is to transfer these gratings into the dielectric material at such critical dimensions, where increased line edge roughness, line wiggling and even pattern collapse can be expected for materials with small mechanical stability such as highly porous low-k dielectrics. In this work we first compare three different patterning options for 12 nm half-pitch gratings at the hard mask level: EUV-based SADP and 193i-based SAQP and SAOP. This comparison will be based on process window, line edge/width roughness and cost. Next, the transfer of 12 nm line/space gratings in the dielectric material is discussed and presented. The LER of the dielectric lines is investigated as a function of the dielectric material, the trench depth, and the stress in the sacrificial hard mask. Finally, we elaborate on the different options to enable scaling down from 24 nm MP to 16 nm MP, and demonstrate 8 nm line/space gratings with 193i-based SAOP.", "This paper discusses the approach and solution adopted by GLOBALFOUNDRIES, a high volume manufacturing (HVM) foundry, for dry-etch related edge-signature surface particle defects issue facing the sub-nm node in the gate-etch sector. It is one of the highest die killers for the company in the 14-nm node. We have used different approaches to attack and rectify the edge signature surface particle defect. Several process-related & hardware changes have been successively implemented to achieve defect reduction improvement by 63%. Each systematic process and/or hardware approach has its own unique downstream issues and they have been dealt in a route-cause-effect technique to address the issue.", "Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) is a thin film removal technique based on sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. ALE is the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD). This talk will discuss new thermal ALE procedures that have been developed recently for the thermal ALE of metal oxides, metal nitrides and elemental metals. Thermal ALE provides for atomic layer controlled and isotropic etching. Al2O3 ALE will be demonstrated using sequential fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions using HF and Al(CH3)3 as the reactants. TiN ALE will be presented using sequential reactions based on oxidation and fluorination to a volatile fluoride using O3 and HF as the reactants. W ALE will be illustrated using sequential oxidation, conversion to a different metal oxide and fluorination to a volatile fluoride. W ALE employs O3, BCl3 and HF as the reactants. Thermal ALE will be useful for the atomic layer processing required for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.", "A two-dimensional, cellular automata model for atomic layer etching (ALE) is presented and used to predict the etch rate and the evolution of the roughness of various surfaces as a function of the efficiencies or probabilities of the adsorption and removal steps in the ALE process. The atoms of the material to be etched are initially placed in a two-dimensional array several layers thick. The etch follows the two step process of ALE. First, the initial reaction step (e.g., Cl reacting with Si) is assumed to occur at 100% efficiency activating the exposed, surface atoms; that is, all exposed atoms react with the etching gas. The second reaction step (e.g., Ar ion bombardment or sputtering) occurs with efficiencies that are assumed to vary depending on the exposure of the surface atoms relative to their neighbors and on the strength of bombardment. For sufficiently high bombardment or sputtering, atoms below the activated surface atoms can also be removed, which gives etch rates greater than one layer per ALE cycle. The bounds on the efficiencies of the second removal step are extracted from experimental measurements and fully detailed molecular dynamics simulations from the literature. A trade-off is observed between etch rate and surface roughness as the Ar ion bombardment is increased.", "A selective, rapid thermal-cyclic atomic-level etching (ALE) of tungsten is developed. The first step of this process is exposing the surface of tungsten with hydrofluorocarbon plasma at \u221222\u00b0C to form a tungsten fluoride-based surface modified layer on the tungsten surface. The second step is rapid thermal annealing with infrared (IR) irradiation to remove the surface modified layer. Tungsten 4f peaks and a fluorine 1s peak, which were assigned to tungsten fluoride, were observed by in-situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy immediately after plasma exposure. The peaks that originated from tungsten fluoride disappeared after the samples were annealed. Cyclic etching tests were carried out by repeating plasma exposure and IR irradiation with a 300-mm ALE tool. Films of tungsten, TiN, and SiO2 were used as sample materials. The amount of etched tungsten increased as the number of cycle repetitions increased. The etched amount per cycle for tungsten was 0.8 nm. In comparison, etching of TiN and SiO2 was not detected. Conformal etching profiles of patterned samples after 60 cycles were obtained. Furthermore, the etched amount per cycle showed saturation behavior with regard to plasma exposure time. Selective, rapid thermal cyclic ALE of tungsten was thus successfully demonstrated.", "Predicting the etch and deposition profiles created using plasma processes is challenging due to the complexity of plasma discharges and plasma-surface interactions. Volume-averaged global models allow for efficient prediction of important processing parameters and provide a means to quickly determine the effect of a variety of process inputs on the plasma discharge. However, global models are limited based on simplifying assumptions to describe the chemical reaction network. Here a database of 128 reactions is compiled and their corresponding rate constants collected from 24 sources for an Ar/CF4 plasma using the platform RODEo (Recipe Optimization for Deposition and Etching). Six different reaction sets were tested which employed anywhere from 12 to all 128 reactions to evaluate the impact of the reaction database on particle species densities and electron temperature. Because many the reactions used in our database had conflicting rate constants as reported in literature, we also present a method to deal with those uncertainties when constructing the model which includes weighting each reaction rate and filtering outliers. By analyzing the link between a reaction\u2019s rate constant and its impact on the predicted plasma densities and electron temperatures, we determine the conditions at which a reaction is deemed necessary to the plasma model. The results of this study provide a foundation for determining which minimal set of reactions must be included in the reaction set of the plasma model.", "The thin nature of EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) resist has posed significant challenges for etch processes. In particular, EUV patterning combined with conventional etch approaches suffers from loss of pattern fidelity in the form of line breaks. A typical conventional etch approach prevents the etch process from having sufficient resist margin to control the trench CD (Critical Dimension), minimize the LWR (Line Width Roughness), LER (Line Edge Roughness) and reduce the T2T (Tip-to-Tip). Pre-etch deposition increases the resist budget by adding additional material to the resist layer, thus enabling the etch process to explore a wider set of process parameters to achieve better pattern fidelity. Preliminary tests with pre-etch deposition resulted in blocked isolated trenches. In order to mitigate these effects, a cyclic deposition and etch technique is proposed. With optimization of deposition and etch cycle time as well as total number of cycles, it is possible to open the underlying layers with a beneficial over etch and simultaneously keep the isolated trenches open. This study compares the impact of no pre-etch deposition, one time deposition and cyclic deposition/etch techniques on 4 aspects: resist budget, isolated trench open, LWR/LER and T2T.", "We report a sub-30nm pitch self-aligned double patterning (SADP) integration scheme with EUV lithography coupled with self-aligned block technology (SAB) targeting the back end of line (BEOL) metal line patterning applications for logic nodes beyond 5nm. The integration demonstration is a validation of the scalability of a previously reported flow, which used 193nm immersion SADP targeting a 40nm pitch with the same material sets (Si3N4 mandrel, SiO2 spacer, Spin on carbon, spin on glass). The multi-color integration approach is successfully demonstrated and provides a valuable method to address overlay concerns and more generally edge placement error (EPE) as a whole for advanced process nodes. Unbiased LER/LWR analysis comparison between EUV SADP and 193nm immersion SADP shows that both integrations follow the same trend throughout the process steps. While EUV SADP shows increased LER after mandrel pull, metal hardmask open and dielectric etch compared to 193nm immersion SADP, the final process performance is matched in terms of LWR (1.08nm 3 sigma unbiased) and is only 6% higher than 193nm immersion SADP for average unbiased LER. Using EUV SADP enables almost doubling the line density while keeping most of the remaining processes and films unchanged, and provides a compelling alternative to other multipatterning integrations, which present their own sets of challenges.", "The semiconductor industry has been pushing the limits of scalability by combining 193nm immersion lithography with multi-patterning techniques for several years. Those integrations have been declined in a wide variety of options to lower their cost but retain their inherent variability and process complexity. EUV lithography offers a much desired path that allows for direct print of line and space at 36nm pitch and below and effectively addresses issues like cycle time, intra-level overlay and mask count costs associated with multi-patterning. However it also brings its own sets of challenges. One of the major barrier to high volume manufacturing implementation has been hitting the 250W power exposure required for adequate throughput [1]. Enabling patterning using a lower dose resist could help move us closer to the HVM throughput targets assuming required performance for roughness and pattern transfer can be met.\nAs plasma etching is known to reduce line edge roughness on 193nm lithography printed features [2], we investigate in this paper the level of roughness that can be achieved on EUV photoresist exposed at a lower dose through etch process optimization into a typical back end of line film stack. We will study 16nm lines printed at 32 and 34nm pitch. MOX and CAR photoresist performance will be compared. We will review step by step etch chemistry development to reach adequate selectivity and roughness reduction to successfully pattern the target layer.", "The need for forming gratings (for example used in VR headsets) in materials such as SiO2 has seen a recent surge in the use of Ion beam etching techniques. However, when using an argon-only beam, the selectivity is limited as it is a physical process.\nTypically, gases such as CHF3, SF6, O2 and Cl2 can be added to argon in order to increase selectivity; depending on where the gas is injected, the process is known as Reactive Ion Beam Etching (RIBE) or Chemically Assisted Ion Beam Etching (CAIBE). The substrate holder can rotate in order to provide an axisymmetric etch rate profile. It can also be tilted over a range of angles to the beam direction. This enables control over the sidewall profile as well as radial uniformity optimisation. Ion beam directionality in conjunction with variable incident beam angle via platen angle setting enables profile control and feature shaping during nanopatterning. These hardware features unique to the Ion Beam etching methods can be used to create angled etch features. The CAIBE technique is also well suited to laser diode facet etch (for optoelectronic devices); these typically use III-V materials like InP.\nHere, we report on materials such as SiO2 etched without rotation and at a fixed platen angle allowing the formation of gratings and InP etched at a fixed angle with rotation allowing the formation of nanopillars and laser facets.", "No single lithography technology can create <24nm pitch patterns in a single pass except for direct-write e-beam which is too slow and expensive for HVM. Various complex multi-patterning process flows can be compared by Cost Per Wafer Pass (CPWP), a term defined as the cost-of-ownership (CoO) with all yield losses set to zero in high volume manufacturing (HVM). CPWP modeling allows for the evaluation of alternate 1D and 2D patterning paths, including EUV LE2, EUV SADP, ArFi LE4, ArFi SAQP + EUV cut-mask, and ArFi SADP + DSA + ArFi block-mask. Similar CPWP for ArFi- and EUV-based flows favor the latter due to reduced yield losses and manufacturing times.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is one of the most promising patterning technologies for future lithography nodes. However, one of the biggest challenges to DSA is the pattern transfer by plasma etching from BCP to hardmask (HM) because the etch selectivity between BCP and neutral brush layer underneath is usually not high enough to enable robust pattern transfer. This paper will explore the plasma etch conditions of both BCPs and neutral brush layers that may improve selectivity and allow a more robust pattern transfer of DSA patterns into the hardmask layer. The plasma etching parameters that are under investigation include the selection of oxidative or reductive etch chemistries, as well as plasma gas pressure, power, and gas mixture fractions. Investigation into the relationship between BCP/neutral brush layer materials with varying chemical compositions and the plasma etching conditions will be highlighted. The culmination of this work will demonstrate important etch parameters that allow BCPs and neutral brush layers to be etched into the underlying hardmask layer with a large process window.", "In integrated circuit and memory devices, size shrinkage has been the most effective method to reduce production cost and enable the steady increment of the number of transistors per unit area over the past few decades. In order to reduce the die size and feature size, it is necessary to minimize pattern formation in the advance node development. In the node of sub-10nm, extreme ultra violet lithography (EUV) and multi-patterning solutions based on 193nm immersionlithography are the two most common options to achieve the size requirement. In such small features of line and space pattern, line width roughness (LWR) and line edge roughness (LER) contribute significant amount of process variation that impacts both physical and electrical performances.\nIn this paper, we focus on optimizing the line roughness performance by using wafer stress engineering on 30nm pitch line and space pattern. This pattern is generated by a self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) technique for the potential application of fin formation. Our investigation starts by comparing film materials and stress levels in various processing steps and material selection on SAQP integration scheme. From the cross-matrix comparison, we are able to determine the best stack of film selection and stress combination in order to achieve the lowest line roughness performance while obtaining pattern validity after fin etch. This stack is also used to study the step-by-step line roughness performance from SAQP to fin etch. Finally, we will show a successful patterning of 30nm pitch line and space pattern SAQP scheme with 1nm line roughness performance.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) is a promising alternative technology to overcome the limits of patterning for the semiconductor industry. DSA exploits the self-assembling property of BCPs for nano-scale manufacturing and to repair defects in patterns created during photolithography. After self-assembly of BCPs, to transfer the created pattern to the underlying substrate, selective etching of PMMA (poly (methyl methacrylate)) to PS (polystyrene) is required. However, the etch process to transfer the self-assemble \u201cfingerprint\u201d DSA patterns to the underlying layer is still a challenge. Using combined experimental and modelling studies increases understanding of plasma interaction with BCP materials during the etch process and supports the development of selective process that form well-defined patterns. In this paper, a simple model based on a generic surface model has been developed and an investigation to understand the etch behavior of PS-b-PMMA for Ar, and Ar/O2 plasma chemistries has been conducted. The implemented model is calibrated for etch rates and etch profiles with literature data to extract parameters and conduct simulations. In order to understand the effect of the plasma on the block copolymers, first the etch model was calibrated for polystyrene (PS) and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) homopolymers. After calibration of the model with the homopolymers etch rate, a full Monte-Carlo simulation was conducted and simulation results are compared with the critical-dimension (CD) and selectivity of etch profile measurement. In addition, etch simulations for lamellae pattern have been demonstrated, using the implemented model.", "The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of etch transfer in two challenges of LER metrology raised by recent evolutions in lithography: the effects of SEM noise and the cross-line and edge correlations.\nThe first comes from the ongoing scaling down of linewidths, which dictates SEM imaging with less scanning frames to reduce specimen damage and hence with more noise. During the last decade, it has been shown that image noise can be an important budget of the measured LER while systematically affects and alter the PSD curve of LER at high frequencies. A recent method for unbiased LER measurement is based on the systematic Fourier or correlation analysis to decompose the effects of noise from true LER (Fourier-Correlation filtering method). The success of the method depends on the PSD and HHCF curve. Previous experimental and model works have revealed that etch transfer affects the PSD of LER reducing its high frequency values. In this work, we estimate the noise contribution to the biased LER through PSD flat floor at high frequencies and relate it with the differences between the PSDs of lithography and etched LER. Based on this comparison, we propose an improvement of the PSD/HHCF-based method for noise-free LER measurement to include the missed high frequency real LER.\nThe second issue is related with the increased density of lithographic patterns and the special characteristics of DSA and MP lithography patterns exhibits. In a previous work, we presented an enlarged LER characterization methodology for such patterns, which includes updated versions of the old metrics along with new metrics defined and developed to capture cross-edge and cross-line correlations. The fundamental concept has been the Line Center Roughness (LCR), the edge c-factor and the line c-factor correlation function and length quantifying the line fluctuations and the extent of cross-edge and cross-line correlations. In this work, we focus on the role of etch steps on cross-edge and line correlation metrics in SAQP data. We find that the spacer etch steps reduce edge correlations while etch steps with pattern transfer increase these. Furthermore, the density doubling and quadrupling increase edge correlations as well as cross-line correlations.", "EUV Lithography is ready for High Volume Production, further enabling the printing of ever smaller features. In this keynote, the author will briefly reflect on evolution and future of digital technologies. An overview of the development and major milestones of Lithography lenses \u2013 with aberrations being a main focus \u2013 from the mid 1990 to today will be presented. Other aspects \u2013 like mask 3D effects, Source Mask Optimization, High NA EUV and Stochastic will be discussed.", "Under the growing concern on the cost and complexity of pitch-only scaling, scaling paradigm in logic technology is changing with adoption of design technology co-optimization (DTCO) and system technology co-optimization (STCO). On this landscape of rapid technology evolution, Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) faces its insertion into high volume manufacturing (HVM) from 2019 with shift on focus from infrastructural readiness to high volume manufacturability. In this presentation, EUV insertion strategy into the logic technology nodes will be discussed on the horizon of current and up-coming industry technology nodes. With remaining technical challenges in EUV across mask, patterning, computational lithography and design, it will be discussed how EUV can be coupled with other technological considerations to enable smooth adoption.", "While EUV systems equipped with a 0.33 Numerical Aperture (NA) lens are readying to start high volume manufacturing, ASML and ZEISS are in parallel ramping up their activities on an EUV exposure tool with an NA of 0.55. The purpose of this high-NA scanner, targeting an ultimate resolution of 8nm, is to extend Moore\u2019s law throughout the next decade. A novel lens design, capable of providing the required Numerical Aperture, has been identified; this lens will be paired with new, faster stages and more accurate sensors enabling the tight focus and overlay control needed for future process nodes. In this paper an update will be given on the status of the developments at ZEISS and ASML. Next to this, we will address several topics inherent in the new design and smaller target resolution: M3D effects, polarization, focus control and stitching.", "A 0.5-NA extreme ultraviolet micro-field exposure tool has been installed and commissioned at beamline 12.0.1.4 of the Advanced Light Source synchrotron facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Commissioning has demonstrated a patterning resolution of 13 nm half-pitch with annular 0.35 \u2013 0.55 illumination; a patterning resolution of 8 nm half-pitch with annular 0.1 \u2013 0.2 illumination; critical dimension (CD) uniformity of 0.7 nm 1\u03c3 on 16 nm nominal CD across 80% of the 200 um x 30 um aberration corrected field of view; aerial image vibration relative to the wafer of 0.75 nn RMS and focus control and focus stepping better than 15 nm.", "Moore\u2019s law drives the doubling of the number of transistors per unit area every 2-3 years. To enable cost-effective shrink of future devices, a new High-NA EUV platform is being developed in a joint collaboration between ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT. The High-NA EUV scanner employs a novel Projection Optics Box (POB) design concept with a numerical aperture of 0.55 that enables 8nm half pitch resolution and a high throughput. The novel POB design concept tackles the limitations in angular acceptance of the EUV multilayer (ML) masks at increased NA, however also has implications on the system design and usage of the tool. The introduction of a central obscuration in the POB reduces the angular load on the ML mirrors inside the POB, enabling a high transmission and therefore high throughput. The obscuration size has been chosen for minimal impact on imaging performance. Furthermore, the High-NA scanner will be equipped with a highly flexible illuminator, similar to ASML\u2019s NXE:3400 illuminator, that supports loss-less illumination shapes down to 20% pupil fill ratio (PFR). In this paper, we will show that High-NA EUV delivers increased resolution and contrast, thereby supporting EPE requirements of future nodes. We will show that the obscuration can benefit the imaging performance of via- and cutmask-layers by blocking the zeroth order light from the pupil, enhancing image contrast. Further contrast enhancement is possible by introducing alternative absorber stacks.", "High-NA extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is going to deliver the high-volume manufacturing (HVM) patterning for sub-7 nm nodes for the semiconductor industry. One of the critical challenges is to develop suitable EUV resists at high resolution with high sensitivity and low line-edge roughness (LER). The resist performance is generally limited by the resolution-LER-sensitivity (RLS) tradeoff and it is critical to find new resists that have a performance beyond this tradeoff. EUV interference lithography (EUV-IL) is a powerful and efficient technique that can print high resolution: half pitch (HP) down to 6 nm nanostructures. In this work, we evaluate the performance of the EUV resists, including molecular resist, inorganic resist, chemically-amplified (CAR) and metal sensitizer chemically-amplified resist (Metal-CAR). Six resists with the best performance have been compared in dose-to-size, line-edge roughness, exposure latitude for half pitch 16 nm and 14 nm. The molecular resist A showed lowest dose to resolve HP 16 nm (35 mJ/cm2) and 14 nm (41 mJ/cm2) but with high line edge roughness (LER 3.5 nm). CAR resist C provided lowest LER 1.9 and 1.8 nm for HP 16 nm and HP 14 nm, respectively, but with higher doses 74 mJ/cm2 (HP 16 nm) and 69 mJ/cm2 (HP 14 nm). The inorganic resist showed comprehensive good performance, giving low LER of 2.1 nm with 50 mJ/cm2 and 42 mJ/cm2 for HP 16 nm and HP 14 nm, respectively. Using the simplified Z-factor model, we showed that the LER of the resists was improved over the last two years. As the inorganic resist could resolve HP 11 nm with dose 67 mJ/cm2, we conclude it to be the current best candidate to partially resolve the RLS tradeoff problem and could be the potential EUV resist for semiconductor technological node printing.", "As EUV lithography is being introduced into the market, the need for resists that can satisfy the exigent requirements of sensitivity, resolution, and line-edge roughness requires the development of guidelines for new generations of materials. In this work, we aim for gaining more understanding on the contribution of the organic components in inorganic-organic hybrid molecular resists to their sensitivity. A method to investigate the effect of specific functionalities on the sensitivity of metal oxo clusters is presented, which consists in the \"doping\" of the methacrylate shell through the introduction of fluorinated, iodinated and extended aromatic ligands. By introducing each of these functionalities in small ratios to the methacrylate ligand (1:11 and 2:10) the main chemical properties of the materials (solubility and molecular packing in the thin film) are expected to be unaltered. Our investigations show that the sensitivity is enhanced in the presence of halogens and drastically decreased when extended aromatic compounds are introduced. The trends are uncorrelated with the absorptivity estimated for each material, which seems to indicate that the doping functionalities might interfere with the cross-linking of the methacrylate ligands or introduce new chemical pathways. Our results indicate that specific organic functionalities can be used to tune the reactivity of hybrid compounds for EUV light by introducing them in doping amounts, thus preserving the processability of the initial material.", "Metal oxide nanoparticle resists are promising materials for highly-resolving high-throughput patterning. However, their performance is still inadequate for the application to the production of semiconductor devices. In this study, the dependence of the relationship between chemical gradient and line width roughness (LWR) on the pattern duty, acid generator, and developer was investigated using a zirconia (ZrO2) nanoparticle resist. The line-and-space patterns of ZrO2 nanoparticle resists were analyzed on the basis of the EUV sensitization mechanism. LWR was roughly inversely proportional to the chemical gradient. The proportionality constant decreased with the increase of the ratio of nominal space width to the nominal line width. The proportionality constant for n-butyl acetate was smaller than that for an alternative developer with a high polarity. The proportionality constant decreased by the addition of an acid generator. The improvement of dissolution process and the suppression of secondary electron migration are essential to the suppression of LWR in the ZrO2 nanoparticle resist.", "The cost-effectiveness and future progress of EUV (13.5 nm) lithography will largely depend on the resist technology development. Hybrid inorganic-organic photoresists have emerged as promising materials of EUV and have gained increasing attention in recent years. A crucial aspect for hybrid materials is their stability and the preservation of their molecular integrity when deposited as thin films. In this work, we study novel zinc (Zn) oxoclusters as molecular hybrid photoresists. Our aim is to combine the reactivity of methacrylate organic ligands with an inorganic cluster with high EUV photon absorption cross-section arising from this metal. To gain understanding on the shelf life of this material, changes in their structure under different conditions were monitored employing a combination of different spectroscopic techniques. The sensitivity of these oxoclusters under EUV light was investigated and their patterning performance is evaluated using EUV interference lithography. Our results indicate that these novel Zn-based oxoclusters are promising candidates for EUV lithography owing to their high dose sensitivity. Nevertheless, the labile nature of the methacrylate ligands has an important impact in the development process which seems to hamper their reproducibility. This work contributes to the understanding of the pitfalls and advantages of hybrid molecular resists.", "This paper continues our work on what we call stochastic printing failures, i.e. random, non-repeating, isolated defects which we believe to be the result of the particle nature of light and matter, and of the probabilistic nature of their behavior and interactions. Examples of such failures are microbridges, locally broken lines and missing or merging contacts. The probability of such stochastic failures increases rapidly when a dimension in the pattern becomes very \u201csmall\u201d. We refer to this rapid increase as the \u201cstochastic cliffs\u201d. In this paper we continue our exploration of the metrology for accurate mapping of these stochastic cliffs, for the case of simple L/S and contact-array patterns. We do this using a combination of CD-SEM , e-Beam Inspection (eBI) and Optical Defect Inspection measurements, according to the need and applicability. We will also show that away from the Cliffs we (sometimes) find a \u201cStochastic Floor\u201d, i.e. a constant level of stochastic failures of a given type. Next to failures counting, we introduce the size distribution of microbridges as a complementary metric. The examples given in this paper aim to clarify what the \u201cstochastic landscape\u201d can look like. Such measurements identify which failure types are the potential yield limiters of the intended application, and at which structures (pitches) and CDs they occur.", "As the industry looks to extend single-expose extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, stochastic effects become a significant concern to enable yield, for both trench and via levels. Multiple previously-published reports have shown a strong tradeoff between resist sensitivity and observed stochastic defectivity. However, the limits of this trade-off between improving stochastics-related defects with a higher dose resist remains to be understood. How strongly does the resist formulation itself contribute to stochastics, or is it a purely dosedriven effect? In this paper, we perform a systematic evaluations of resist component variants to determine the relative effects of photon shot noise induced stochastics vs material stochastics. Material contributions are probed through formulation component and reaction kinetics changes. The defectivity at post-exposure and post-etch are correlated to electrical yield to validate the evaluation. The effect of material and dose contribution to defectivity process window enables to highlight the significant and challenging task of addressing material stochastics that can be convoluted with photon shot noise.", "In applying EUV lithography to 5-nm technology node and beyond, stochastic defect issues have arisen, seriously affecting manufacturing yield and/or limiting applicable minimum device sizes. To develop materials/processes with suppressing such defects and to bring them under control, we discuss a probabilistic model for stochastic defect generation processes. To deal with extremely low probability (typically 10-4~10-12) while being based on physics and chemistry of resist exposure, our model combines Monte Carlo method with probabilistic models. We focus on two mechanisms as causes of stochastic defects, (A) accidental connections of photon shot noises enhanced by densely localized secondary electron (SE) generation and (B) cascading SE generations along photoelectron trajectories. Our analyses show significantly higher defect probabilities in EUV than in ArF and their strong dependences on patterns sizes and process conditions, which is attributed to a wider spatial inhomogeneity in SE generation. Material parameter optimization by combining the model with the multi-objective genetic algorithm shows a trilemma among defect probability, target size, and required exposure dosage to size. It also shows necessity of scaling material parameters with shrinking target design rules. Guidelines for defect suppression are also suggested.", "CD-based process windows have been an analysis workhorse for estimating and comparing the robustness of semiconductor microlithography processes for more than 30 years. While tolerances for variation of CD are decreasing in step with the target CD size, the acceptable number of printed defects has remained flat (Hint: Zero) as the number of features increases quadratically. This disconnect between two key process estimators, CD variability and defect rate, must be addressed. At nodes that require EUV lithography, estimating the printed defects based solely on a Mean CD (\u201cCritical Dimension\u201d) process window is no longer predictive. The variability / distribution of the printed CDs must be engineered so that there are no failures amongst the billions of instances, rendering the Mean CD, often measured on just hundreds or thousands of instances, a poor predictor for outliers. A \u201cdefect-aware\u201d process window, where the count of printed defects is considered in combination with more advanced statistical analysis of measured CD distributions can provide the needed predictability to determine whether a process is capable of sufficient robustness. Determining process robustness where stochastics and defects are taken into account can be simplified by determining the CD process margin. In this work we study dense contact hole arrays exposed with 0.33NA single exposure EUV lithography after both the lithography and etch steps. We describe a methodology for expanding the analysis of process windows to include more than the mean and 3\u03c3 of the data. We consider the skew and kurtosis of the distribution of measured CD results per focus-exposure condition and compare / correlate the measured CD process window results to the CD process margin.", "The interaction of 91.6eV EUV photons with photoresist is very different than in optical lithography at DUV wavelength. The latter is understood well, and it is known that photons interact with the resist on molecular level: e.g. for chemically amplified resist (CAR) the photon interacts with the photo acid generator (PAG), which leads to a deprotection reaction on a polymer. At EUV however, the high energy photons interact with the matter on the atomic scale, resulting in the generation of secondary electrons, which in turn induce chemical modification at lower energies. Although the complex detailed EUV mechanisms that lead to a chemical reaction in CAR are still not fully understood, we have developed and optimized an alternative technique to measure the reactions. The technique is based on Residual Gas Analysis (RGA) and enables to reveal the chemical identity of outgassed reaction products, therefore it can give information on the ongoing reactions during EUV exposure. In this work, we used this technique in a feasibility study to investigate how the balance of CAR resist reactions related to solubility and insolubility can impact the resist stochastic failure. This has first been applied on a model resist to characterize what the relevant reactions are for the solubility of the CAR. The method enabled to quantify the CAR acid yield and the (EUV specific) reactions that can lead to insolubility as function of dose. Based on the understanding of the ongoing reactions, the methodology has been applied on a family of resists \u2013 centered on a commercial resist \u2013 formulated on one polymer type but with different PAG/quencher. All these materials have been tested towards the balance of solubility reactions as function of dose and towards stochastic failures. A tentative correlation was found between the measurement of the stochastic failures and a semi-empirical equation of the RGA based resist parameters related to solubility.", "Stochastic effects are the ultimate limiters of optical lithography and are a major concern for next-generation technology nodes. In previous work, we compared the performance of several types of EUV resists on dense patterns or brightfield mask SRAM cells across technology nodes. It was shown that due to low photon/chemical shot noise and reduced blur, metal-oxide resists could potentially reduce lithography failures at the 5nm technology node though even at 7nm technology node failures may be noticeable if process variations are considered. Following up on work published the last three years, in this paper we study how different OPC strategies and photoresist properties might affect failure rates for a darkfield mask SRAM cell at the 5nm technology node. Four cases are considered: \u2022 Aerial image optimization by mask biasing; stochastic simulations are performed with an organic chemically amplified resist model. \u2022 Aerial image optimization by model-based OPC; stochastic simulations are performed with an organic chemically amplified and a metal-oxide resist model. \u2022 Aerial image model-based OPC enhanced by rigorous stochastic modeling; stochastic simulations are performed with an organic chemically amplified resist model. In all cases, a numerical aperture of 0.33 is used. Process windows are generated averaging ~2150 (3.5\u03c3) stochastic simulations for each focus-dose combination, while best focus-dose target CDs are found by analyzing failure rates across focus and dose. Roughly 1.8 million (5\u03c3) trials are then run at best condition for all cases to quantify part per million failures.", "The lack of defect-free EUV photomask blanks is one of the multiple challenges in the application of EUV lithography for high volume wafer manufacturing. In EUV photomask manufacturing, shifting the design before writing to avoid patterning over blank defects (pattern shift process) is one of the methods for defect mitigation. A reliable pattern shift process depends upon precise image placement during EUV mask writing. Specifically, accurate determinations of centrality, mean shift distances and residual image placement (IP) errors (3\u03c3) are required and reports describing pattern shift processes1-8 echo this importance of accurate IP during EUV photomask writing. The pattern shift process detailed in this report improves IP accuracy for EUV photomasks aligned on fiducial marks (FM) and increases the budget of potential pattern shifts, while remaining within the mask centrality specification limits. Our process is demonstrated on EUV products where <5 nm 3\u03c3 of uncorrected IP error for aligned patterns was achieved.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is entering an industry production phase for 7nm logic and is under development for next node logic and memory applications. A key benefit of EUVL for logic interconnect lithography comes from the ability to pattern the metal layer at aggressive pitch using a single exposure. We report here a mask process compatible with a 30nm pitch patterning module for the demanding sub 7nm node, single expose interconnect application. We found a large increase in mask to wafer image transfer sensitivity during the 32nm to 30nm pitch shrink development that led to increases in stochastic and systematic wafer defect generation mechanisms. In this work, we describe our steps to characterize, model and improve the mask related factors that reduce this sensitivity as part of a successful 30nm pitch patterning module demonstration. High resolution wide area electron beam mask inspection alongside a suite of advanced mask characterization and optimization(AMCO)tools were key elements in understanding mask process gaps and improvement opportunities. Critical mask parameters optimized in closed loop with wafer response included two and three dimensional pattern fidelity, line roughness and spatial variability. Mask critical dimension targeting was found to be a critical factor for delivering the yielding 30nm pitch wafer process and this targeting was tuned dynamically through mask and wafer co-optimization. Finally, the role of wafer anchored process simulation proved an invaluable guide for linking various mask error source mechanisms to the wafer response.", "Programmed defect masks (PDMs) of a tantalum-based absorber were fabricated by a conventional and improved process that decreased the mask line width roughness (LWR). The improved mask LWR decreased the minimum size of recognizable defects from 18.6 nm to 10.9 nm. The PDMs were printed on wafers and their defect printabilities were compared. The correlation coefficients of the relationship between the mask defect size and deviation of wafer critical dimension (CD) caused by the defects were calculated. A significance test of the correlation coefficients of the PDMs produced by the conventional and improved process indicated there was no significant difference between them. This means that the mask LWR did not have a significant influence on defect printability.", "Mask absorber variations are known to impact wafer imaging. To understand these impacts, absorber variations around SRAF and line-end features are studied on both bright and dark field masks. The primary areas of investigation are SRAF absorber thickness and sidewall angle variation. The working hypothesis was that these two variations are most prevalent in EUV mask absorber processing and could limit EUV imaging. In addition, this study will investigate whether Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and can compensate for absorber thickness and sidewall variations. AFM data were collected to identify whether qualitative variations between SRAF and main features in the mask absorber were present. Simulations were deployed to quantify the response of wafer images to mask absorber variations. The study found sensitivity to SRAF SWA and thickness variations in the dark field and bright field cases. The study also found that OPC mitigates a large part of the mask SRAF shape variations, if the OPC model includes the quantified variation. Consequently, mask characterization and inclusion in OPC models is needed to reduce model errors.", "For future nodes, TaN-based absorber layers on EUV mask-blanks, may need to be replaced with thinner layers of new material systems. Ni and Co based materials are promising material candidates owing to their high EUV absorption. Ion Beam Etching (IBE) is being explored as an option for patterning these metallic systems that are hard to etch by Reactive Ion Etch. In this work we expand our initial work on the IBE of Ni absorber films to include the role of etch beam energy and alternative etch-masks for both Ni and Co based films. We present experimental film level data such as etch uniformity, angular-dependent etch rates, and surface roughness. We extend the modeling of IBE of line-space patterns, to narrower line widths and various etch-mask materials vis-a-vis side wall angle and CD fidelity, both as a function of beam energy and angle of etch.", "The impending introduction of EUV lithography into high volume manufacturing at the 7 nm CMOS technology node promises the fulfilment of more than three decades of research and development. However, printing defect-free photoresist features with k1 < 0.4 or line-space pitch < 34 nm using 0.33 NA exposure tools is proving more challenging than originally anticipated. With the introduction timeline of 0.55 NA exposure tools currently unclear, it is necessary to develop EUV multiple patterning strategies for < 34 nm pitch metal layers which are needed to continue area scaling in future 5 nm and/or 3 nm technology nodes. Pursuing EUV-SADP strategies necessitates electrically undesirable dummification of metal wires and the employment of 2 additional masks for self-aligned cutting/blocking of wiring features which may prove cost prohibitive. Therefore, in this study we explore the printability in photoresist of two color EUV LELE or (litho-etch)2 patterns which may be further developed into self-aligned LELE patterning methods. We experimentally examine the impact of image and resist tonality on the printability of minimum line and space for metal wire features. We evaluate the printability of these features based on LCDU, LER, LWR and stochastics defects. Additionally, as EUV exposure time per mask is expected to be a major cost contributor, we quantitatively determine the impact of resist photo-speed on the printability of these two color LELE features.", "The read performance of a spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory device is based on the tunnel magnetoresistance of the magnetic tunnel junction cell, which is a function of the resistance values at low and high resistance states of the magnetic layers. To ensure a robust tunnel magnetoresistance value and high yield, magnetic tunnel junction pillar patterning process should have a good local critical dimension uniformity. In this paper, we screen several patterning techniques, such as dry development rinse material-based tone reversal besides the standard patterning, as well as different resists and underlayer materials to improve the local critical dimension uniformity at 50nm pitch extreme ultraviolet pillar printing. The results of the best litho process obtained show an improvement above 20% for the local critical dimension uniformity performance. The performance metrics such as the process windows analysis, pillar circularity and the critical dimension uniformity have also been checked for the promising litho process options. Moreover, the transfer of the post-litho improvements to the etch process have been checked and qualified after several layers of hardmask etch.", "Enhanced EUV lithography (EUVL) resist performance, combined with optimized post processing techniques, are vital to ensure continued scaling and meet the requirements for the industry N5 node and beyond. Sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) is a post lithography technique that has the potential to significantly improve the EUVL patterning process for stochastic nano-failures and line roughness, both major topics in EUV lithography research. SIS is an ALD-like technique that infiltrates polymeric photoresists, forming a metal framework using the lithography pattern as a template. Hardening of the photoresist improves the pattern quality and gives more flexibility to subsequent pattern transfer steps. We have evaluated the performance of SIS for an EUV Chemically Amplified Resist (CAR) platform printing 32 nm pitch line/space patterns and ultimately structures that are representative of standard semiconductor manufacturing. A combined lithography-SIS-etch process and a standard lithography-etch process were optimized for an industry relevant stack with pattern transfer into a TiN layer. This allows for the first time a justified comparison between a EUVL-SIS and a standard EUVL patterning process, showing the benefits of SIS regarding roughness, exposure latitude and nano-failure mitigation. Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis accurately demonstrates and explains the type of roughness improvement. Nano-failure analysis is done by measuring large areas at different exposure doses and shows the improvement of the nano-failure free window when applying a EUVL-SIS patterning process. We conclude by examining to which extent combining the best lithography process with an optimized SIS step will lead to a better roughness and nano-failure performance, essential to meeting industry requirements.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) materials are deemed as critical to enable and extend the EUV lithography technology. Currently both chemically amplified resist (CAR) and metal-oxide resist (MOR) platforms are candidates to print tight features on wafer, however patterning requirements, process tonality (positive or negative), illumination settings and reticle tonality (dark or bright) play a fundamental role on the material performance and in consequence on the material choice. In this work we focus on the patterning of staggered pillars using a single EUV exposure, and this by looking at the lithographic and etching performance of CAR and MOR platforms, using metrics as process window, local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU), pillar edge roughness (PER), pillar placement error (PPE) and (stochastic) nano-failures. As a bright field reticle shows a lower aerial image contrast to print pillars compared to the aerial image of contact holes using a dark field reticle, we also investigate alternative patterning solutions such as the tone reversal process (TRP) to pattern pillars from contact holes.", "With the introduction of the NXE:3400B scanner, ASML has brought EUV to High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM). In this context, ASML is pursuing a dual-path approach towards zero reticle defectivity: EUV-compatible pellicle or zero particles towards reticle by advanced particle contamination control. This paper will focus on the latter approach of advanced particle contamination control and will show that we are able to reduce particle contamination towards reticle to a level that is compatible with HVM requirements for sub-10nm node lithography.", "The Sharp High-NA Actinic Reticle review Project (SHARP) is a synchrotron-based, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) microscope dedicated to photomask research. A potential upgrade to the SHARP microscope is presented. The upgrade includes changing the light path in the instrument from its current off-axis configuration to an on-axis configuration. This change allows for an increased working distance of 2.5 mm or more. A central obscuration, added to the zoneplate aperture, blocks stray light from reaching the central part of the image, thus improving the image contrast. The imaging performance of the two configurations is evaluated by means of ray tracing.", "Reliable photomask metrology is required to reduce the risk of yield loss in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Actinic pattern inspection (API) of EUV reticles is a challenging problem to tackle with a conventional approach. For this reason we developed an API platform based on coherent diffraction imaging. Aim: We want to verify the sensitivity of our platform to absorber and phase defects. Approach: We designed and manufactured two EUV mask samples with absorber and phase defects and we inspected them with RESCAN in die-to-database mode. Results: We reconstructed an image of an array of programmed absorber defects and we created a defect map of our sample. We inspected two programmed phase defect samples with buried structures of 3.5 nm and 7.8 nm height. Conclusions: We verified that RESCAN in its current configuration can detect absorber defects in random patterns and buried (phase) defects down to 50 \u00d7 50 nm2.", "The strong effort to push further Moore\u2019s law is driving the insertion of EUV pilot production at several captive and merchant semiconductor vendors, which already today puts strong demands on actinic tools metrology capabilities. The EUV mask infrastructure plays a central role for the successful introduction of EUV into high volume manufacturing: to provide the mask shop with actinic review capabilities, ZEISS and the SUNY Poly SEMATECH EUVL Mask Infrastructure consortium developed and launched an actinic metrology platform based on aerial imaging technology. Over the last few years, it was demonstrated how this aerial image metrology platform fulfills the mask shop requirements for actinic defect review and repair verification. In this paper we present the latest performance achievements of the platform together with the discussion on platform based capabilities for possible future actinic metrology extensions, with a special emphasis on the AIMSTM EUV solution for high-NA emulation capabilities.", "RI Research Instrument\u2019s EUV pellicle transmission qualification tool EUV-PTT uses \u201ceffective inband EUV measurement\u201d which is spectrally filtering emission of the EUV-Lamp to 2% bandwidth at 13.5 nm for measuring \u201cas seen by the scanner\u201d. Images of about 20*20 mm\u00b2 are recorded in < 5 seconds. A full pellicle characterization with < 60 images taken is accomplished in less than one hour. Recently, we have performed some studies on applying this technique to carbon nano tube pellicles and on measuring the reflectance of pellicles which will be reported. The latter is heavily demanding as reflectances in the range of 0.01 % were measured with sensitivities and reproducibilities in the range of 0.002 %.", "Understanding, characterization and management of 3D mask effects, including non-telecentricity, contrast fading and best focus shifts, become increasingly important for the performance optimization of future extreme ultraviolet (EUV) projection systems and mask designs. Novel imaging configuration and central obscuration in high NA EUV projection systems introduce additional imaging effects. A simplified coherent imaging model, rigorous mask diffraction simulations, images for individual source areas and a hybrid mask model are employed to analyze the root causes of observed imaging artifacts. Based on this, several image enhancement strategies including modifications of mask and source are devised and investigated for lines/spaces.", "With the introduction of EUV lithography into early manufacturing, the lithography community still struggles with some imaging issues, like the magnitude of usable depth of focus, and reduced contrast which can impact stochastic effects such as defectivity and line edge roughness. In recent years EMF mask effects and their impact on best focus shift in EUV lithography were investigated, and alternative absorber stacks were proposed in order to improve control of focus and contrast. Recently, interest in phase shifting masks has resurfaced, and there are proposals for alternative absorber stacks that depend on feature type to be patterned. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon that for a dipole the separate images of the two monopoles do not overlap with each other. This means that the contrast for the dipole is measurably lower than that of the individual monopoles. We discuss the impact of this effect on contrast and usable depth of focus, propose a method to measure this image split effect, and investigate which absorber materials can reduce it. One approach to suppressing the image split has been the choice of a material that is index matched to vacuum, which therefore shows a negligible image split behavior. While this image split is indeed largely suppressed for absorbers with n \u2248 1, those materials have markedly low intrinsic image contrast, making them unsuitable as absorbers. Instead, we have converged on absorbers that create either a significant phase shift or feature very strong absorption, with recent proposals coming close to a \u03c0 phase shift for attPSM. We hypothesize that the close index match to vacuum is detrimental to imaging because a larger part of the light is absorbed which would otherwise have contributed to imaging.", "As the technology node gets smaller and smaller, the benefit from Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAF) becomes significant in EUV lithography which makes SRAFs a must-have tool for next generation beyond 7nm technology. When considering EUV specific effects, the metrics that need to be accounted for include Image Log-Slope (ILS), Process Variability (PV Band), common Depth of Focus (cDOF), and Image Shift (ImS) through focus. When these critical factors are accounted for during the EUV mask generation the optimization become much more complicated and challenging and necessitates the need for SRAFs beyond 7nm. SRAF helps enhance not only the PV Band, but more importantly helps boost the ILS, which is one of the key factors for improving stochastic effect in EUV. However, ILS is just one of the important image quality metric that we should focus on. For metal layers, Image Shift is another key factor which can have a big impact on overlay. ImS at the nominal condition could be compensated by Optical Proximity Correction (OPC), but image shift through focus can hardly be tuned by the main feature correction. The image shift through focus can be mitigated by SRAF insertion. Strong 3D mask effects can cause best focuses of different patterns to be far apart in EUV, which can cause an unusable cDOF even when the individual depth of focus values of all the patterns are not bad. SRAFs can be inserted to improve the individual depth of focus and align the best focuses together to help enhance the common process window. When taking account of various different EUV specific metrics mentioned above, then the most critical question for the next generation beyond 7nm is \u201cHow to define the cost function for mask optimization with SRAFs?\u201d (Figure 1, EUV mask optimization flow for next generation beyond 7nm). In this study the image quality metrics including ILS, PVBand, cDOF, and ImS are evaluated. For each optimization schema using different cost functions, we examine the cost function metric and its impact on the other image quality metrics. We also present the potential trade-offs together with the analysis. Furthermore, multiple cross cost functions are defined for SRAF optimization and the results are analyzed accordingly. Both contact and metal layer patterns representing next generation beyond 7nm design rules are investigated. In our testing, symmetric standard sources from ASML NXE3400 is examined and the results are compared and analyzed.", "Novel absorber materials are being developed to improve EUV-reticle imaging performance for the next generations of EUV lithography tools. TNO, together with ASML, has developed a compatibility assessment for novel absorber materials, which addresses the risk that exposure of incompatible materials to EUV-radiation and EUV-plasma conditions results in contamination of the optics in the EUV lithography tools. The assessment is divided in two stages to optimize the efficiency of the procedure. Most contamination risks can be addressed cost-efficiently in the first stage with existing vacuum and plasma test facilities. Novel absorber materials can thus be assessed in an early stage of their development without the immediate need for more expensive EUV testing. This stage of the compatibility assessment was executed with an EUV reticle piece with a TaN-based absorber, and results are presented. The TaN-based absorber showed no compatibility issues, as expected. This test procedure now sets the baseline for testing novel absorber materials. 96.000 exposures can be performed in a NXE 3400 EUV lithography tool with a 300W source with absorber materials that successfully passed the first stage of the compatibility assessment. Assuming 96 exposures per wafer, this equals 1000 wafers. Absorber materials that passed the first stage may proceed to the second stage: an accelerated EUV test exposure in the EUV Beamline 2 (EBL2). Each material will be exposed to an EUV-dose equivalent to about half a year of reticle exposure in the NXE 3400 lithography tool with a 300W source. This test is in preparation and expected to be available in the second quarter of 2019.", "EUV lithography is entering High Volume Manufacturing at relative high Rayleigh factor k1 above 0.4. In comparison immersion lithography has been pushed to k1 values of 0.3 or below over the last two decades. One of the strong contributors determining the effective usable resolution is the mask absorber stack. The mask stack alters the diffraction by modifying the phase and intensity of the diffracted orders. In this paper we show the exposure results of a test mask having higher absorbance of EUV light and the advantages of reduced Mask 3D effects to imaging.", "In this work, we demonstrate a method to design the Mo-Si multilayer stack of an EUV photomask to increase the optical efficiency of shadowing-orientation equal lines and spaces imaged under dipole illumination. We achieve this using a computational framework written in the PyTorch machine learning library, which is capable of optimizing the multilayer for partially-coherent imaging rather than specular reflectivity. After computing optimal multilayer designs for both 0.33 and 0.55 NA EUV systems, we verify the improvements via RCWA simulation. We demonstrate optical efficiency gains of up to 22%=14% for the 0.33/0.55 NA systems, respectively.", "We have been developing CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source which is the most promising solution as the 13.5nm high power light source for HVM EUVL. Unique and original technologies such as; combination of pulsed CO2 laser and Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser pulses shooting and mitigation with magnetic field have been developed in Gigaphoton Inc.. We have developed first practical source for HVM; \u201cGL200E\u201d 1) in 2014. We have proved high average power CO2 laser more than 20kW at output power cooperate with Mitsubishi electric cooperation2). Pilot#1 is up running and its demonstrates HVM capability; EUV power recorded at111W average (117W in burst stabilized, 95% duty) with 5% conversion efficiency for 22hours operation in October 20163). Availability is potentially achievable at 89% (2weeks average), also superior magnetic mitigation has demonstrated promising mirror degradation rate (= 0.5%/Gp) above 100W level operation with dummy mirror test.4). Recently we have demonstrated actual collector mirror reflectivity degradation rate is less than -0.4%/Gp by using real collector mirror around 100W ( at I/F clean ) in burst power during 30 Billion pulses operation. We will report latest data 125W average operation with actual collector mirror at conference.

Many efforts were devoted to the fundamental effects of laser parameters on LPP temporal and spatial characteristics and on EUV light emission and absorption. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies allowed prediction of optimum conditions for the efficient sources produced by various lasers. However, improving the quality and reducing the cost of chips production require significant increase in EUV source power. Several studies have shown EUV power limits from laser based sources produced using mass-limited Sn droplets. These limitations can be explained by target/plasma hydrodynamics effects under laser irradiation that can result in reduced transient area of laser/plasma interactions and the high reabsorption of emitted EUV photons in evolving plasma. Therefore, further analysis of the effects of target parameters on EUV output is an important task in the optimization of future high power EUV sources. Colliding plasmas experiments can be very useful in this regard. Development of pre-plasma in these experiments can be regulated by several parameters of two lasers in conjunction with target geometry. The developed pre-plasma characteristics can accurately be measured and optimized for the following main laser (CO2 or Nd:YAG) irradiation to develop very efficient and prolonged EUV emitting area. We used our advanced 3D simulation package (HEIGHTS) for modeling of complex colliding plasmas evolution and EUV source characteristics produced by two simultaneous Nd:YAG lasers interaction with wedge target followed by CO2 irradiation. We used several diagnostics technique and comparison of modeling and experimental results in our CMUXE labs regarding plasma characteristics, laser/plasma/target interactions, and EUV photons emission and absorption. Our results showed that significant enhancement in EUV output can be achieved with optimized parameters of laser beams that could allow approaching the predicted theoretical limit of the conversion efficiency of EUV sources.", "In this paper, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art technologies for laser-produced-plasma (LPP) extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) source performance to enable high volume manufacturing of the N7 node and beyond. Source architecture enabling stable and reliable performance at 250 Watts EUV power, and the technical challenges for scaling of key source parameters and subsystems toward 500W will be described. Improvements in availability of droplet generation and the performance of critical subsystems that contribute to Collector lifetime toward the one tera-pulse level, will be shown. Finally, we will describe current research activities and provide a perspective for LPP EUV sources towards the future ASML Scanners.", "Increasing EUV photon power in laser-produced plasma (LPP) sources is critically needed for efficient nanolithography devices. Improving debris mitigation methods is another important subject in the development of EUV sources for high volume manufacture tools. We investigated different mechanisms affecting ions acceleration in LPP to predict the maximum ion energies and flux arriving at the mirror surface. We studied in details plasma evolution produced by Nd:YAG laser from Sn target to predict EUV producing ions dynamics and their contributions to EUV source.\n\nThe 3D multi-physics fully integrated HEIGHTS package was used in this analysis. We continue to develop, enhance, and benchmark the models implemented in our package to include various physics involved in LPP systems. HEIGHTS simulation of detail ion kinetic energies were compared with experimental data and showed great confidence in our advanced self-integrated models that can then be used for the explanation of the experimental data as well as for various predictions. Spatial and charge distributions were predicted for EUV producing ions and debris. We studied various target configurations and laser parameters to enhance the power of EUV sources as well as to reduce and mitigate ions and debris effects on the collecting mirror system. The comprehensive integrated full 3D models allowed accurate simulation of all processes of plasma formation, dynamics, and EUV photons emission and collection.", "A hydrogen plasma cleaning technique to clean Sn (tin) off EUV collector optics is studied in detail. The cleaning process uses hydrogen radicals and ions (formed in the hydrogen plasma) to interact with Sn-coated surfaces, forming SnH4 and being pumped away. This technique has been used to clean a 300mm-diameter stainless steel dummy collector optic, and EUV reflectivity of multilayer mirror samples was restored after cleaning Sn from them, validating the potential of this technology. This method has the potential to significantly reduce downtime and increase source availability as it occurs in-situ. While previous experiments have been conducted using an RF capacitively coupled plasma, a microwave-generated surface wave plasma (SWP) is advantageous due to its high density, low electron temperature, and ability to be generated locally where etching is needed. Langmuir probe measurements of the surface wave plasma show electron temperatures of 1 to 5 eV and plasma densities on the order of 10^11-12 cm-3. Previous experiments have shown etch rates of greater than 10 nm/min over a 2 inch diameter circular plasma area with an unoptimized SWP launcher. Peak etch rates of 94.9 nm/min were measured in the immediate vicinity of the plasma source. A custom launcher was designed for the 3100 collector and tested in the NXE:3100 chamber at Illinois at standard operating conditions. Previous results at different pressures have been presented, but the flow rate dependency was never investigated. Etch rates at commercially viable pressures and different flow rates were explored and these results will be presented.", "We report on the reduction of the mask 3D effect in an etched 40-pair multilayer extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography mask by measuring the printed \u0394CD (horizontal\u2013vertical) on exposure with a high-NA small field exposure tool (HSFET). We compared these patterns with those of a conventional Ta-based absorber EUV lithography mask. Next, we examined the programmed pattern defect printability of the etched 40-pair multilayer EUV lithography mask and showed that defect printability of the etched multilayer mask was hardly influenced by the direction of EUV illumination. We conclude that the mask 3D effect reduction contributes to simple specifications of the mask pattern defect printability in EUV lithography.", "In this paper, we first explain why the original pseudo-spectral time-domain (PSTD) formulation, as given in a well-know book on computational electromagnetics, is numerically unstable for curvilinear geometries. Then we explain how this problem can be fixed by a simple but crucial modification to the original formulation. The new formulation has allowed us to construct a very accurate and extremely fast rigorous simulator for DUV and EUV lithography. Benchmarks are presented to demonstrate the high accuracy and great speed of the new simulator. This brings us one step closer to achieving the goal full-chip, rigorous simulation for DUV and EUV lithography.", "Spectral reflectometry is an established technique for actinic qualification of EUV mask and blanks. For production in the EUV scanner, however, the homogeneity of the effective inband property \u2013 e.g. reflectance - is more relevant than the spectral reflectance curves. The effective reflectance is usually extrapolated indirectly from the knowledge of Rmax, CWL50 and FWHM, in which the efficiency is mainly proportional to Rmax if the spectral reflectance distribution and its central wavelength are similar to those of the scanner. This fact is accounted for in our AIMERTM metrology solution. In a single measurement AIMER registers the signal from an area of about 20\u00d720 mm2 with a typical 13.5\u00d713.5 \u03bcm2 pixel resolution. This technique is very robust and fast by irradiating the sample with a beam, which is spectrally filtered (e.g. from the Xenon EUV emission of a discharge source) to 2 % spectral bandwidth around the CWL of the scanner. With such an \u201cinband EUV beam\u201d, the efficiency of the sample is recorded with respect to its quality factors throughput and homogeneity \u201cas seen by the scanner\u201d. With multiple exposures stitched together AIMER maps the effective reflectance while being sensitive to the convoluted influence of the single parameter just as effective in scanner use. Mapping of the effective reflectance of a full EUV mask surface is accomplished in less than one hour. In this paper, we compare conventional ALS spectral reflectometry with AIMER results and show first tests of AIMER on structured EUV masks.", "Two methods improving the brilliance of laser-induced plasmas emitting in the extreme UV (EUV) and soft x-ray (SXR) region were investigated, using three different gases (nitrogen, krypton, and xenon) from a pulsed gas jet. Utilizing a newly designed piezo electric valve, up to almost ten times higher gas pressures were applied, resulting in increased target densities and thus, higher conversion efficiencies of laser energy into EUV and SXR radiation. Secondly, geometrically reducing the angle between incoming laser beam and observed plasma emission minimizes reabsorption of the emitted short wavelength radiation. Combining both methods, the source brilliance is increased by a factor of 5 for nitrogen. Furthermore, a compact EUV focusing system for metrological applications is presented utilizing the optimized plasma source. An energy density of 1 mJ/cm\u00b2 at \u03bb = 13.5 nm in the focal spot of an ellipsoidal mirror is achieved with xenon as target gas being sufficient for material removal of PMMA samples with an ablation rate of 0.05 nm/pulse.", "The development of industrial infrastructure for EUV lithography requires a wide array of optics beyond the mask and the scanner optics, which include optics for critical instruments such as actinic inspection optics or in-situ diffusers. This paper will detail recent results in the production of high-precision multilayer coatings achieved to support this development. In the first case, a range of imaging optics with multiple sizes and radial designs are all produced in a cyclic fashion on a single high-volume machine. Optics feature a diameter from a few millimeters to over 200mm, as well as a range of curvatures, on high-capacity machine in which four different optics were efficiently calibrated and coated in parallel. Details relating to results of precision, repeatability, and added surface distortion are highlighted. In the second case, the contribution to developing a diffusing multilayer by using sputter deposition to first create a tuned irregular surface is described. This diffusive EUV surface is a critical component for an in-situ EUV scanner wavefront metrology system based on lateral shearing interferometry. Details will be shared on the use of Cr as a thin film that can be deposited to meet process requirements for the tuned parameters of surface roughness required to reduce the reflective specular component and the spatial frequency spectrum of the roughness to fully fill the pupil without excessive overfill leading to loss of light.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology is one of the leading candidates under consideration for enabling the next generation of devices, for 7nm node and beyond. As the focus shifts to driving down the 'effective' k1 factor and enabling the second generation of EUV patterning, new techniques and methods must be developed to reduce the overall defectivity, mitigate pattern collapse, and eliminate film-related defects. A typical defect Pareto for EUV line-space patterning is dominated by bridging defects and pattern collapse. Regarding pattern collapse, careful attention needs to be paid to optimizing the rinse process to avoid the large forces that cause collapse during drying. In this paper, we present an optimized rinse technology that works to prevent that pattern collapse, especially on EUV line/space patterns below 40nm pitch. Additionally, this paper reviews the ongoing progress in track-based processes (coating, developer) that are required to enable EUV patterning. This work is especially focused on defect mitigation during film coating and resist developing processes, which have a direct effect on the occurrence of bridging defects during pattern transfer.", "In this paper the authors present the EUV laboratory exposure tool in a new configuration for in-band operation at a wavelength of 13.5 nm, named EUV-LET 2.0. Compared to the previous configuration for a working wavelength of 10.9 nm, which was aimed at cost-efficient general nanostructuring, the main applications of the EUV-LET 2.0 can be found in the industrial research, development and quality control of EUV photoresists. The tool is capable of photoresist characterization in terms of sensitivity, contrast, outgassing behavior and resolution. Additionally, the exposure tool can be utilized for in-band transmission measurements of photoresists and filters. The EUV-LET 2.0 uses the xenon plasma emission from a compact discharge-produced plasma (DPP) EUV source, filtered to in-band EUV at 13.5 nm with 4 % bandwidth (at full-width at half maximum) by an out-of-band filter (niobium/silicon nitride) and a multilayer mirror (molybdenum/silicon). High-resolution phase-shifting transmission masks define the features and are positioned precisely to the resist-coated wafer. An EUV sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) camera supports beam alignment and diffraction efficiency measurements. For high-resolution patterning the (achromatic) Talbot lithography is used, which is perfectly suited for partially coherent radiation of a defined bandwidth, as provided by a plasma-based radiation source. The paper addresses the general tool configuration including spectral characterization of the DPP EUV source before and after multilayer reflection, diffraction efficiency measurements of a realized phase-shifting mask, contrast curve measurements and exemplary exposures performed with a single contact hole mask. Different exposure results are achieved by varying the mask to wafer distance and by controlled movement of the wafer stage during an exposure. In this way both, de-magnified contact hole arrays as well as lines and spaces arrays with 35 nm half-pitch are obtained.", "For EUV-lithography, reliable measurements of the radiant power throughout the optical chain are an essential requirement for the optimization of the lithographic production process as well as for the development of new applications like EUV-based metrology tools. From dose control to aerial imaging, specialized detectors are required - ranging from simple diodes to sophisticated imaging detectors like CCD or CMOS systems. For all these applications, sensitivity, homogeneity and lifetime are crucial parameters. While extended lifetime and sub percent homogeneity requirements are common among all detector uses, sensitivity targets range from single photon sensitivity for spectroscopy detectors to deliberately reduced sensitivity for dose control at high-power sources. Photon detector calibration in the EUV spectral range is therefore a prerequisite for new detector developments and a basis for the introduction of EUV-lithography into volume manufacturing. PTB employs two dedicated and complimentary EUV beamlines for radiometric characterizations of photon detectors. The wavelength range covered reaches from below 1 nm to 45 nm for the two EUV beamlines. Longer wavelengths coverage in the VUV range (out-of-band) is provided at PTB\u2019s VUV radiometry beamline. The standard spot size is 1 mm by 1 mm with an option to go as low as 0.1 mm by 0.1 mm. For lifetime testing, a dedicated exposure setup with power densities of up to 20 W/cm2 is operated. It enables exposures in the range of 100 kJ/cm2 within a reasonably short time. Lower fluence levels are available by attenuation or exposure farther out of focus. We will explain calibration basics, describe PTB's calibration capabilities in the EUV spectral range and show exemplary data for the respective detector types.", "Advanced technology nodes are demanding aggressive printability using EUV. EUV printing process inherently brings in stochastic defects. To measure and experience various types of Stochastics in EUV printing, high volume measurements are deemed necessary. Furthermore the classification of the defects in terms of stochastic and systematic is also required. The permutation and combinations of shapes, sizes, and proximity driven stochastics errors are high in numbers, leading to significant increase in the number of test structures needed. Without electrically measurable solutions, the defect test measurement exercise becomes impractical to perform visually. This paper will describe few examples of developing and handling the test structures capable to capture the defects and defect location and further to classify the defects in terms of stochastic or systematic defects.", "As the critical dimension (CD) of electronic devices continues to be scaled down to less than 10-nm in size, the lineedge roughness (LER) becomes a critical issue that significantly affects the CD, as well as the device performance because the LER does not scale along with the feature size. Therefore, the LER needs to be reduced to continue to shrink the feature size as well as minimize the device malfunctions. In this study, the LER impacts on the performance of fin-field-effect-transistors (FinFETs) are investigated using a compact device method. For the fluctuation of electric potentials due to the fin-width roughness (FWR) based on the stochastic fluctuation during the lithography process, electric potentials with fat-fin, thin-fin, big-source, and big-drain FWRs are right shift, left shift, down shift, and upper shift to the electric potential without FWR, respectively. For the fluctuation of drain currents due to gate voltages, drain currents with fat-fin, big-source, and big-drain FWRs are righter shift in order. According to the Taguchi method, gate voltage and channel length are more dominant parameters on the sensitivity of electronic potential and current drain of a FinFET device.", "Photosensitized Chemically Amplified ResistTM (PSCARTM) has been demonstrated as a promising solution for a high sensitivity resist in EUV lithography mass production. This paper describes the successful calibration of a PSCAR resist model for deployment within rigorous lithography process simulation, capturing continuum as well as stochastic effects. Verification of the calibrated model parameters was performed with new patterns or with new resist formulations with good agreement. The reduction of required EUV dose of PSCAR resist while maintaining similar roughness levels have been achieved both from experimental result and from simulated result. The simulation of PSCAR continues to be a great tool for understanding, predicting, and optimizing the process of PSCAR.", "EUV lithography has been brought into mass production. To enhance the yield, improvements in critical dimension (CD) stability, and defectivity still remain of utmost importance. In order to enhance the defectivity performance on contact hole pattern, continuous work has been executed.1 As the result of process optimizations presented at SPIE 2018 for 24 nm contact hole half pitch pattern, single- and multi-closed hole modes as caused by particles included in coating materials, called \u201cin-film particles\u201d, or stochastic failures are the major of defects modes. For defectivity improvement work done this year, optimization of material dispense has been carried out in an attempt to improve the defectivity of single- and multi-closed holes as caused by in-film particles. As the result, totally 19 % of defectivity improvement was obtained as compared with conventional dispense conditions. On the other hand, CD variability is comprised of several components such as wafer to wafer, field to field, within field, and local CD. In addition, not only coater/developer but also scanner, mask, and materials contribute to the variations. In this paper, CD uniformity (CDU) optimization on also contact hole 24 nm half pitch pattern has been executed to improve each component from the standpoint of coater/developer. As a result of the optimization of development process, 13.9 and 6.4 % of field to field and within field CDU improvement have been achieved, respectively.", "A simulation model to analyze exposure and development processes of EUV resists is presented. The model combines percolation model and diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) model to simulate dissolution of the resist molecules into developer, which has been exposed randomly by the EUV photons. We investigate the roughness of the pattern caused by the photon shot noise with the model as a function of line width and dose.", "We investigated the dissolution kinetics of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS) in an alkali developer with tetramethylammoniumhydroxide (TMAH). Experiments using PHS with different molecular weights and molecular weight dispersions and developer with different concentrations of TMAH led to the clarification of the dissolution behavior. Not only a change in the dissolution time but also a change in the dissolution behavior was observed upon changing the concentration of the developer. The dissolution behavior depends on an index calculated from values indicating the effects of swelling and dissolving. The dissolution occurred through the swelling of the polymer bulk and the subsequent diffusion of polymer chains into the solution bulk. The development using the alkali aqueous solution system was complex. The swelling rate should not be much larger than the dissolving rate for the development of high-resolution resists because a high swelling rate causes the generation of defects during the fabrication of fine structures.", "Gigaphoton Inc. is developing a laser produced plasma (LPP) extreme ultra violet (EUV) light source for high-volumemanufacturing (HVM) semiconductor lithography. Original technologies and key components of this source include a high-power carbon dioxide (CO2) laser with 15ns pulse duration, a short wavelength solid-state pre-pulse laser with 10ps pulse duration, a highly stabilized small droplet (DL) target, a precise laser-DL shooting control system and debris mitigation technology with a magnetic field. In this paper, an update of the development progress of the total system and of the key components is presented.", "Tri-layer processes, which typically consist of photoresist, Si containing anti-reflective coating (Si-ARC) and spin on carbon (SOC), have been widely used since ArF immersion lithography. Continually reduced pattern dimensions need thinner photoresist films due to the common phenomenon of post-develop line collapse with higher aspect ratios. Consequently, it has been necessary to enhance pattern transfer performance after etching with such tri-layer processes. Successfully implementing tri-layer processes requires consideration of issues such as increased process steps, cost, and other inherent limitations of pattern transfer enhancement with a more complicated stack. In this work, we present a hemicellulose SOC material with the outstanding advantage of Si etch selectivity greater than 15. Hemicellulose SOC could significantly reduce pattern transfer limitations for etching, therefore the benefits of processing higher aspect ratio structures can be more easily achieved. Herein, we investigate the hemicellulose SOC lithography performance using resolution, sensitivity, and line width roughness as metrics. Also, we demonstrate these lithography performances through the etching. During the conference, we will discuss the potential issues of next generation processes using ArF immersion and EUV lithography.", "In this paper we present a technique for measuring the phase of EUV phase shift masks. In this technique we image the mask with a specialized objective lens that generates a superposition of two laterally separated images that interfere onto a detector. The resulting interference contains information about both the amplitude and the phase of the mask. By changing the incident illumination angle, we can control the bulk phase of the interference fringes, which allows us to reconstruct the phase difference between two adjacent points on the mask using standard phase retrieval techniques. While this method only reconstructs phase differences, it can be used to fully characterize the amplitude and phase of features provided that they are adjacent to a flat reference area on the mask.", "The Berkeley MET5, funded by EUREKA, is a 0.5-NA EUV projection lithography tool located at the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley National Lab. Wavefront measurements of the MET5 optic have been performed using a custom in- situ lateral shearing interferometer suitable for high-NA interferometry. In this paper, we report on the most recent characterization of the MET5 optic demonstrating an RMS wavefront 0.31 nm, and discuss the specialized mask patterns, gratings, and illumination geometries that were employed to accommodate the many challenges associated with high-NA EUV interferometry.", "In EUV, photoelectrons and secondary electrons play indispensable roles in the chemistry of photoresist. An accurate understanding of electron related processes provides foundation for targeted engineering of resists and other EUV materials. As chemistry is initiated by secondary electrons, acquiring the electron energy distribution inside an actual photoresists is important for improving the efficiency of chemical activation. We demonstrate that condensed phase photoemission spectroscopy can be used as a tool for interrogating electrons in resist and electrons owing from underlayers to resists. The electron energy distribution, albeit different from that measured with condensed phase photoemission spectroscopy, can be recovered computationally. The computational approach involves Monte Carlo simulations using the energy resolved scattering mean free path and the photoemission energy spectra as inputs.", "The design and implementation of metasurface-based flat lenses have come to the forefront of ongoing scientific research and technology development. These novel photonic devices use sub-wavelength metal or dielectric resonators spaced on a specific two-dimensional pattern that mimic the phase profile of conventional bulk optical elements. However, most of these structures, or metasurfaces, have so far been passive with its optical performance determined only by the spatial configuration of the metasurface constitutive elements. The development of dynamic metasurfaces is currently a growing area of research directed to obtain real-time tunable operation of metasurfaces and new physical phenomena not feasible with static metasurfaces. Faster reconfigurable metasurfaces can be achieved by incorporating nanostructures with different optical response onto MEMS based actuators. The MEMS-metasurface platform enables electrostatic control of curvature, tilt angle and deformation of metasurfaces, enabling flat and agile optical elements with micro-second reconfiguration time. These unique dynamic metasurfaces may provide new opportunities for information optics and imaging by performing complex signal processing directly in the optical domain. In this presentation, I will describe the fundamentals and advantages of incorporating metallic and dielectric metasurfaces onto MEMS devices and the challenges associated with their patterning and integration.", "We use the term \u201csingle-digit nanofabrication\u201d (SDN) to describe the structuring and characterization of materials whose key features are defined and resolved on a scale of 10 nm or less. Achieving single-digit nano resolution in synthesis and fabrication is a central challenge for the development of next-generation functional nanoscale and mesoscale materials Single digit nanostructured materials have special properties with regard to the control and flow of energy. Energy can take, for example, electronic, magnetic, thermal or photonic forms. We will focus on how material components can be structured with high accuracy and precision in classical lithographic processes 2D and how we can achieve new or improved properties in 3D fabrication. One of the field that requires such precision, resolution and control of materials is nanophotonics. Nanophotonics covers light interactions with dielectric materials and plasmonic effects in metallic structures. In addition, we have emerging efforts in exciton transport in organized nanomaterials. PLASMONIC LIMITS Gap Plasmonic antennas are of great interest due to their ability to concentrate light into small volumes. Smaller the volume higher is the enhancement until the gap is so closed that other effect start to became more important. Theoretical studies, considering quantum mechanical effects, have predicted the optimal spatial gap between adjacent nanoparticles to be in the subnanometer regime in order to achieve the strongest possible field enhancement. We developed a technology [1] to fabricate gap plasmonic structures with subnanometer resolution, high reliability, and high throughput using collapsible nanofingers. The systematic investigation of the effects of gap size are consistent with previous findings as well as with a straightforward theoretical model that is presented here. LARGE AREA METASURFACES Metasurfaces have facilitated the replacement of conventional optical elements with ultrathin and planar photonic structures. Previous designs of metasurfaces were limited to small deflection angles and small ranges of the angle of incidence. We have created two types of Si-based metasurfaces, [2] working both in transmission and reflection modes, to steer visible light to a large deflection angle. These structures exhibit high diffraction efficiencies over a broad range of angles of incidence. We have demonstrated metasurfaces based on conventional thin film silicon processes that are suitable for the largescale fabrication of high-performance devices. EXCITONIC PROPERTIES OF DIRECTED ASSEMBLY PEROVSKITE NANOCRYSTALS Colloidal nanomaterials display a broad range of unique chemical and physical properties that make them prime candidates as nanoscale building blocks for the development of future technologies. Towards this goal, one of the main challenges resides in developing methods to manipulate these materials with a level of precision comparable with their small size. We studied the effects of topography and surface chemistry on the assembly behavior of perovskite nanocrystals PNC [3] with outstanding optical properties and great potential for applications in optoelectronics and photonics. Arranging PNCs in 1D-like features allows careful studies of the collective mechanisms of exciton diffusion and recombination in PNCs assemblies, which in turn determine the optoelectronic behavior of the system and offer fundamental guidance in engineering new optoelectronic devices made of PNCs.

Although photopolymers remain the primary material system for MPL, others have been developed for creating functional structures in chalcogenide glasses and polymer-composites. Post-exposure processes have been developed for transforming a structure created by MPL into another material, such as a metal, semiconductor, or oxide glass. MPL has been used to create a wide range of functional nanophotonic devices. The full potential of MPL is apparent in its use to create spatially-variant lattices (SVLs). SVLs are a new class of nanophotonic device that is engineered to direct and control the flow of light in 3D. The devices are based on unit cells that control the propagation of light through the selfcollimation effect. These unit cells are spatially varied in orientation throughout an SVL so that light flows along a prescribed path within the device. The geometry and patterns of the unit cells within the lattice can also be varied to control other key properties, such as phase and polarization. SVLs and their fabrication by MPL opens a new route to 3D integrated photonics, and a myriad of other applications.", "Self-assembled rolled-up microtubes are exploited to rigorously compact 2D devices into 3D microarchitectures. We demonstrate integration of transistors, integrated circuitry as well as electronic, photonic and magnetic components into microtube devices for sensor arrays and novel device platforms such as lab-in-a-tube systems. In combination with self-wound energy storage units our work bridges lengthscales for a new generation of high performance electronic microdevices.", "The advance in microlithography has greatly helped the development of micro optical elements. Large array of microlenses can now be fabricated in the same fashion as manufacturing of integrated circuit at low cost and high yield [1-2].\nBecause microlens array requires well-defined and continuous surface relief profile, special methods are needed to supplement the normal microlithography to produce those spherical structures [3]. Various techniques have been developed, and the most widely used is multi-step photolithography with thermal resist reflow. However, the alternative grayscale photolithography technique appears to be the one as the most flexible and versatile method [4].\nIndeed, this approach is a one-level lithography process enabling the development of 3D profiles in a photoresist masking layer. In addition, with the need to maintain or improve image quality at an ever-smaller pixel size, grayscale technic can offer one way to compensate the loss of the photosensitive area by achieving zero-gap microlens. One other advantage of grayscale is the possibility to have, from a single lithography, objects of different shapes, but also at the same time of different sizes (especially heights); which is possible with classical lithography only by doing multi-patterning.\nThere are several options for performing grayscale lithography, for example the HEBS mask (high energy beam sensitive) which darkens under exposure to electrons. The option that has been chosen is to use a grayscale reticle, with varying chromium features densities that locally modulate the intensity of transmitted UV light. Being non-uniformly exposed, this allows the creation of a relief structure in the resist layer after development. The resist height after development depends on the intensity of the incident light, the exposure time and the contrast of the resist. So contrary to conventional lithography where the goal is to achieve straight resist pattern profiles, grayscale lithography enables the realization of progressive profiles, which requires smooth resist contrast curve. The other specificity of these resists is that they must crosslink without flowing.\nIn this paper, we evaluate resists from different suppliers to generate microlenses smaller than 5\u03bcm via a grayscale mask. The study consists in establishing the contrast curves of these resists according to different process parameters, giving the designer great control of grayscale levels that can be achieved for a given resist. Then, pattern various microlenses shapes in these resists to evaluate the residual resist thickness according to the gray levels. With the final objective of establishing a relationship between these contrast curves and the profile variations at the microlens level to compute a suitable and accurate grayscale mask [5].", "Imprint lithography is an effective and well known technique for replication of nano-scale features. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) manufacturing equipment utilizes a patterning technology that involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. The technology faithfully reproduces patterns with a higher resolution and greater uniformity compared to those produced by photolithography equipment. Additionally, as this technology does not require an array of widediameter lenses and the expensive light sources necessary for advanced photolithography equipment, NIL equipment achieves a simpler, more compact design, allowing for multiple units to be clustered together for increased productivity. Previous studies have demonstrated NIL resolution better than 10nm, making the technology suitable for the printing of several generations of critical memory levels with a single mask. In addition, resist is applied only where necessary, thereby eliminating material waste. Given that there are no complicated optics in the imprint system, the reduction in the cost of the tool, when combined with simple single level processing and zero waste leads to a cost model that is very compelling for semiconductor memory applications. Any new lithographic technology to be introduced into manufacturing must deliver either a performance advantage or a cost advantage. Key technical attributes include alignment, overlay and throughput. In previous papers, overlay and throughput results have been reported on test wafers. In this work, improvements to the alignment system, together with the High Order Distortion Correction (HODC) system have enabled better distortion and overlay results on both test wafers and device wafers. On test wafers, XMMO of 2.9nm and 3.2nm in x and y respectively was demonstrated. SMO of 2.2nm and 2.4nm was achieved, with an opportunity to further improve results by applying wafer chucks with better flatness specifications. Comparable results were also achieved on device wafers by applying a multi-wavelength alignment strategy and a feed forward strategy to realize align signal convergence within the allocated 0.60 second budget.", "Imprint lithography is a promising technology for replication of nano-scale features. For semiconductor device applications, Canon deposits a low viscosity resist on a field by field basis using jetting technology. A patterned mask is lowered into the resist fluid, which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. Overlay budgets play a large role in defining production readiness. As an example, DRAM devices require overlay on the order of 20% of the half pitch. Canon uses a through the mask (TTM) alignment system to measure a Moir\u00e9 image anywhere in the field. This system can also record alignment errors of all fields and all marks. The data collected by the TTM system correlates very closely with an Archer measurement tool. In addition, a High Order Distortion Correction (HODC) system, which applies a heat input on a field by field basis through the use of a DMD array has been combined with magnification actuators to correct high order distortion terms up to K30. There is an additional distortion term that must also be addressed for the case of nanoimprint lithography. NIL drop patterns are typically designed to minimize resist fill time and create a uniform residual layer beneath the resist pattern. For device wafers, however, it is important to recognize that there are both long wavelength flatness errors coming from the wafer chuck and existing pattern topography from previously patterned levels that cause out of plane errors. When the mask comes in contact with the resist on the wafer, these out of plane errors can then induce mask bending, resulting in an additional distortion term. To minimize this distortion, a Drop Pattern Compensation (DPC) Model has been implemented to minimize the added distortion terms. In this paper we describe the origins of the out of plane errors, and describe the model used to correct these errors along with some examples. Finally, results are presented for a device like wafer in which the overlay errors within a field are reduced from 5.4nm to 3.4nm, 3 sigma.", "We will introduce SCIL as a full-wafer soft-stamp base nanoimprint technique with the advantages of being able to replicate sub-10nm features and perform micron accurate overlay alignment over 200mm wafers. The combination of PDMS based soft stamps and an inorganic crosslinking imprint resist leads to a very long stamp lifetime and the direct patterning of complex deep sub-micron patterns, such as slanted gratings with an index up to n=2.1. These complex patterns are of high interest for nano-photonic enabled applications such AR/VR and metasurfaces with applications such as \u201cperfect\u201d flat lenses. A new analytical model based on hyper-elastic deformation of silicon rubber nano-patterns was developed and is able to accurately predict pattern stability from sub-micron to less than 20nm patterns.", "Imprint lithography is an effective and well known technique for replication of nano-scale features.

Any new technology to be introduced into manufacturing must deliver either a performance advantage or a cost advantage. Given the risks associated with this introduction, generally a combination of both performance and cost advantage is preferred. In this paper both performance attributes and cost are discussed. NIL resolution and linewidth roughness do not have the limitations of conventional projection lithographic method. Furthermore, it is not subject to patterning restrictions that forced the industry towards one dimensional patterning. A cost example case of 20nm dense contacts is also presented. Because NIL utilized a single step patterning approach, process costs are substantially reduced relative to ArF immersion lithography. Overall, NIL currently realizes a 28% cost advantage for this case, but as mask life continues to improve, the cost advantages become much more significant.", "A low cost alternative lithographic technology is desired to cope with the challenges in decreasing feature size of semiconductor devices. Nano-imprint lithography (NIL) is one of the viable candidates. [1][2][3] NIL has been a promising solution to overcome the cost issue associated with expensive process and tool of multi patterning and EUVL. The challenges of NIL implementation for mass-production are overlay, defects, throughput, template life, and template patterning. The overlay and defects must satisfy the requirements of the products applied. The throughput needs to provide adequate cost of ownership (CoO). Since NIL is a contact process, its template damage by the particles on a wafer is inescapable and a longer template life is required for mass production.[4]-[10] In our previous study, we have reported that the hp2xnm NIL process performance is getting closer to the requirement for the high volume manufacturing. We focused on the process overlay accuracy and demonstrated dramatic reduction of process overlay error by using CVA(controlled viscosity alignment) and HODC(high order distortion control) function of FPA-1200 NZ2C. [11] Currently, we have further developed a nanoimprint lithography (NIL) technology including NIL system, template, and resist process for half pitch 14 nm direct pattering. The hp14 nm template was fabricated by a self-aligned double patterning (SADP) on a template. Using this template, we fabricated hp 14 nm dense Si lines with a depth of 50 nm on a 300 mm wafer. In this paper, we report on the latest lithography performance of NIL including hp14nm pattering with single mask exposure.", "Mapper has installed its first product, the FLX\u20131200, at CEA-Leti in Grenoble (France). This is a maskless lithography system, based on massively parallel electron-beam writing with high-speed optical data transport for switching the electron beams. The FLX-1200, containing 65,000 parallel electron beams, has a 1 wph throughput at 300 mm wafers and is capable of patterning any resolution and any different type of structure all the way down to 28 nm node patterns. The system has an optical alignment system enabling mix-and-match with optical 193 nm immersion system using standard NVSM marks. Mapper Lithography and CEA-Leti are collaborating to develop turnkey solution for specific applications. In figure 1 the basic operation principle of the Mapper technology is shown. The electron optics have no central crossovers making them intrinsically insensitive to Coulomb forces (electron repulsion). The electron optics are modular and much cheaper than high-NA DUV optics, and can be replaced or upgraded in the field. The wafer exposure happens one column of fields at a time and always in the same direction. There is no need to meander. The focus and leveling is performed during stage fly-back to reduce metrology overhead. Each column of fields is aligned separately, with dedicated alignment targets. Figure 1, Basic operation of the Mapper technology. In figure 2 the way the beams are distributed over the electron optics slit is shown. The writing strategy is as follows: - There are up to 5 slits, staggered in X direction for reasons of wafer coverage. The approach is roughly analogous to an inkjet printer - Each slit area consists of 204 x 13 individual groups of beamlets, organized in a hexagonal array. - All beamlets are simultaneously horizontally deflected over a range of 2\u00b5m while the wafer is scanned vertically. - Each group comprises 49 individual beamlets (7x7). Each of the 49 beamlets can independently be switched on and off during exposure. - Each beamlet results in a Gaussian spot on the wafer with 25 nm FW50 diameter (10.6nm 1\uf073). - Total beamlet count will therefore equal 5 x 204x13 x 49 = 649,740. In the FLX-1200 and FLX-1300 the central 10% are used (one half slit area): 65,000 A more detailed description of the principles of operation is given in [2]. Figure 2,Distribution of the beams over the electron optics slit. The focus of presentation will be the reporting of the performance achieved of the tool installed at CEA-Leti during endurance runs in full tool configuration. This includes status of: - Exposure throughput - Achieved resolution and CD uniformity - Stitching performance - Matched Machine Overlay - Tool availability and uptime Also the different application areas for such a maskless system are discussed. In figure 3 a preview of a CD uniformity measurement result is shown. On a 300 mm wafer fields of 5mm x 5mm have been exposed containing 60nm dense lines and spaces. The main source of CD variation is caused by differences between the groups of beamlets. To measure this variation we have taken 824 SEM images, each taken of a pattern written by a different beam group. The result is shown in figure 3. The variation is 8nm 3s, and follows a Gaussian distribution of 6nm 3s. Figure 3, Distribution of 824 CD measurements results on 60nm dense lines and spaces", "A multi-beam mask writer MBM-1000 is developed for the N5 semiconductor production. It is designed to accomplish high resolution with 10-nm beam and high throughput with the 300-Gbps blanking aperture array and inline corrections. It inherits dose correction functions for secondary dose from scattered electron which has been used with single variable shaped beam (VSB) writers with full compatibility. It also has new corrections in scale shorter than 10 um to cope with electron backscattering occurring with EUV substrates and CD bias from resist process. To improve patterning resolution, pixel level dose correction (PLDC) is implemented to correct and enhance profile of dose deposited in resist. Writing test with pCAR showed that PLDC solves breakage and loss of assist patterns without affecting shape and size of main patterns.", "Publisher\u2019s Note: This video, originally published on 16 August 2019, was withdrawn per author request.", "The progress of using DSA for metal cut to achieve sub-20nm tip-to-tip (t2t) critical dimension (CD) is reported. Small and uniform t2t CD is very challenging due to lithographic limitation but holds the key to backend-of-the-line (BEOL) scaling. An integration scheme is demonstrated that allows the combination of design flexibility and fine, rectified local CD uniformity (LCDU). Functional electrical testable Via-Chain structure is fabricated to verify the integrity of the proposed method. Through the analysis of the observed failure modes, the process is further improved. By validating DSA for such an important patterning element as metal cut, the DSA maturity can be further advanced and hopefully move DSA closer to HVM adoption.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) of Block Copolymer (BCP) is a promising lithography approach to achieve high resolution pattern dimensions. The current chemo-epitaxy process used to induce block copolymer self-alignment is showing today its limitations. This is due to the resolution limitation of conventional lithography technics needed for the guide formation, used to achieve BCP alignment. This paper introduces a new chemo-epitaxy process, named ACE (Arkema-CEA), which is based on sidewall image transfer (SIT) patterning. This process has the great advantage to offer guides of small critical dimension (CD) and pitch that allows the integration of high \u03c7 BCP. In this paper, different parameters of the ACE process are investigated (commensurability, spacer CD \u2026) in order to precisely determine the DSA process window defining the best conditions for BCP alignment. Process window with multiplication factor ranging from 2 to 4 are obtained on BCP under investigation.", "Lithographic and pitch-multiplying spacer technologies are widely used to shrink interconnect periodicity within critical layers. This places significant burden on overlay and CD uniformity of the subsequently patterned vias to physically contact and electrically connect critical layers to the rest of the integrated circuit in a nearly defect-free and perfectly-consistent manner. We are evaluating the combination of EUV and DSA patterning technologies to meet this challenge and enable future technology nodes. The contact hole guide pattern is fabricated atop bilayer hardmask material by single-exposure EUV, surface-modified with telechelic polymer brush materials, and finally shrunk/rectified using self-assembled, lamella-forming polystyrene-block-polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA). The nascent via pattern is then blanket exposed by DUV light and the photolyzed PMMA is selectively rinsed away. Here we study the process performance of DSA pattern wet etch chemistry and subsequent dry etch pattern transfer into bilayer hardmask material using both metrology and electrical yield measurements as evaluation criteria. In particular, the choice of wet etch solvation strength selective towards PMMA was varied from moderate (isopropanol, IPA) to good (acetic acid, AAc). Due to the ability of AAC to solubilize all covalently-untethered PMMA, regardless of molecular weight, the resulting average CD is wider and its local distribution is more uniform. In contrast, IPA is only capable of rinsing away the smallest PMMA fragments, resulting in relatively tighter bounds about the preferable blanket UV dose, and a smaller average CD and less-uniform local CD distribution. These morphological differences are confirmed by cross-sectional transmission electron micrographs. Brightfield inspection and inline electrical testing are used to compare relative defectivity and yield, respectively, to assess the potential impact on device performance for processes utilizing either solvent.", "The development of various forms of super-resolution microscopy have paralleled the resolution gains in lithography. From micron limited resolution 30 years ago, to nm resolution today. In biology, the fundamental direction has been to work towards increasing fine structure in the absence of pitch shrink\u2014a fundamentally similar problem to modern lithography. There are a variety of supper-resolution techniques\u2014depletion based, interferometric, harmonic, and multicolor. From a theoretical perspective, both problems are bound by information transfer limits in the system and ultimately by noise.", "Alternative lithography approaches, especially pattering technologies are in advance since several years. Every day new, more or less high localized, AFM-tip based structuring methods as well as new optical and e-beam methods become acquainted. Most of them are sequential single-point procedures. The local interaction reaches from 150 nm up to sub-10 nm. Especially tip based methods are developed on the basis of atomic force microscopes AFM. Therefore, the ranges, which can be structured, are only in the range of 2 \u00b5m x 2 \u00b5m up to 100 \u00b5m x 100 \u00b5m. In most cases it is not known or not verified if those new tip based techniques are suitable for larger ranges and areas. Even the stages and control algorithms of AFM\u2019s are not optimized for defined, high dynamic and as well high stable scanning trajectories in the nanometre respectively in the sub-nanometre level. Here, Prof. Tseng from Arizona State University noted \u201cthe quality\u2026of the nanostructures created by TipBased Nanofabrication depend greatly on the capacities of equipment and instruments used and the extent to which the tip can be precisely controlled. It is unavoidable that the TBN system be automated and that precision of control be in the subnanometers for dimension accuracy, and sub-nanonewtons for force accuracy.\u201d [1] A first way out to increase the precision could be the application of so-called metrological AFM, especially developed at national metrological institutes. But the deficit of a small scanning range still remains. Nanopositioning and nanomeasuring machines where developed at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Institute of Process Measurement and Sensor technology, first for positioning and measuring three-dimensional objects in a range of 25 mm x 25 mm x 5 mm with 20 pm resolution and nanometer precision [12]. They can equipped with most versatile probing systems like AFM, laser focus probes and 3D-micro probes to fulfill extraordinary metrological challenges. This unique precision is allowed by the application of an extended three-dimensional Abbe-comparator principle combined with high precision laser interferometer controlled stage in six degrees of freedom. A substantial progress in nano patterning can be achieved by combining this outstanding technology with advanced scanning proximal probe lithography on the base of Fowler-Nordheim-electron-field emission [30]. In this NPMmachine the high precision large area pattern generation can be combined with an advanced high speed nanometrology simultaneously. This paper addresses different aspects that are related to the metrological challenges in increasing measuring volumes up to 200 mm x 200 mm x 25 mm, high dynamic nanopositioning and control on complex trajectories, as well as implementation of nanofabrication tools into the NPMM-machine.", "This paper reports the modelling, simulation and fabrication process of a novel heated atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. The fabricated cantilever is used for thermal dip pen nanolithography (t-DPN) applications where the heated AFM cantilever can deposit molten polymer. The ability to control the flow of the molten polymer via thermocapillary force during pattering is limited in current heated AFM cantilevers. We present a new design of the heated AFM cantilever to improve the patterning speed and provide the ability to control the flow rate of the polymer. In this paper, we focus on the nanofabrication part to explain different semiconductor fabrication process development and integration for manufacturing the heated AFM cantilevers.", "Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) is a breakthrough 3D printing/additive manufacturing process pioneered by Carbon (Science, 2015) that uses digital light projection, oxygen permeable optics, and programmable liquid resins to manufacture high-performance, durable final polymeric products.

This talk will give an overview of the DLS process as it stands today, with an emphasis on the materials developed and qualified to meet the unique demands of applications in a variety of industries.", "Advances in lithography and nanofabrication have long been driven by the requirements of the classic Von Neumann architecture. As Moore's Law comes to its end and advances in computing shift the market's demand for computing towards AI, entirely new architectures, neuromorphic architectures, are coming into vogue. The different requirements of neuromorphic computers, including enormous demand for memory and a high tolerance for defects, requires a reassessment of what is and is not feasible in IC manufacturing. Alternative approaches to lithography and fabrication, such as directed self-assembly, which suffer from high rates of defectivity incompatible with conventional architectures, may be necessary to build the most complicated and dense future architectures conceived. We will review the different requirements for a range of future architectures based on novel nanotechnology and some of their use cases in neuromorphic computing. We will show that while some approaches, such as GPU replacements which seek to accelerate vector matrix multiplication, have many of the same manufacturing requirements as existing conventional computers, other, memory intensive architectures have different tolerances for defectivity depending on the nature of the defects and the use case. For crossbar topologies, different strategies can be used to tolerate row and column defects as well as point defects on individual devices. The different use cases involving inference, ex-situ training, in-situ training, supervised and unsupervised learning each also have distinct regimes of defect tolerance, with ex-situ trained systems being the least tolerant and unsupervised, in-situ trained systems being the most tolerant. With directed self-assembly also having a large dynamic range of defect densities (0.1%-10%), we use estimates of defect tolerance from the established literature to intuit approximate regimes of usefulness for different technologies. Understanding the limits of defect tolerance in these systems is especially important given the increasing memory density demands of neuromorphic architectures requiring monolithic 3D integration of logic and memory. Manufacturing multiple stacked layers at the smallest feature size can become cost prohibitive due to the large number of critical mask steps. With a neuromorphic architecture however, operating in the most tolerant use case to defects, it may become possible exploit advances in 3D assembly to realize the largest and most complex computing architectures based on unsupervised learning of unstructured data.", "Crossbar arrays of resistive non-volatile memories (NVMs) offer a novel and innovative solution for deep learning tasks which are typically implemented on GPUs [1]. The highly parallel structure employed in these architectures enables fast and energy-efficient multiply-accumulate computations, which is the workhorse of most deep learning algorithms. More specifically, we are developing analog hardware platforms for acceleration of large Fully Connected (FC) Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) [1,2], where training is performed using the backpropagation algorithm. This algorithm is a supervised form of learning based on three steps: forward propagation of input data through the network (a.k.a. forward inference), comparison of the inference results with ground truth labels and backpropagation of the errors from the output to the input layer, and then in-situ weight updates. This type of supervised training has been shown to succeed even in the presence of a substantial number of faulty NVMs, relaxing yield requirements vis-\u00e0-vis conventional memory, where near 100% yield may be required [2]. We recently surveyed the use of analog memory devices for DNN hardware accelerators based on crossbar array structures and discussed design choices, device and circuit readiness, and the most promising opportunities compared digital accelerators [3]. In this presentation, we will focus on our implementation of an analog memory cell based on Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and 3-Transistor 1-Capacitor (3T1C) [4]. Software-equivalent accuracy on various datasets (MNIST, MNIST with noise, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) was achieved in a mixed software-hardware demonstration with DNN weights stored in real PCM device arrays as analog conductances. We will discuss how limitations from real-world non-volatile memory (NVM), such as conductance linearity and variability affects DNN training and how using two pairs of analog weights with varying significance relaxes device requirements [5, 6, 7]. Finally, we summarize all pieces needed to build an analog accelerator chip [8] and how lithography plays a role in future development of novel NVM devices. References: [1] G. W.

Mechanically-ruled gratings have been produced for more than a hundred years. A diamond tool is used to create parallel grooves onto a fine metallic coating layer that has been previously deposited on a polished substrate. The edge-on profile of these grooves is a sawtooth tilted at a specific angle called the \"blaze\" angle. The blaze angle is the deciding factor that will allow for maximum efficiency at a specific wavelength called the \"blaze\" wavelength. Holographic gratings are produced using interference lithography. A layer of photoresist deposited on a substrate is exposed to fringes usually formed by exposure to two coherent laser beams. After development, the resulting pattern is sinusoidal by nature. Blazing one side of the sinusoidal profile of holographic gratings is possible through ion etching, but is only commonly used for a limited subset of grating parameters. Both types of gratings have different advantages: - Ruled gratings have a sharp, blazed profile that ensures good efficiency. However, they suffer from groove spacing inconsistencies that lead to stray light and ghosting. - Holographic gratings do not suffer from groove spacing errors which minimizes stray light. However, their sinusoidal profile (if not ion etched) leads to efficiency losses. At Penn State University, we are studying new processes that allow to fabricate blazed, high efficiency and high spectral resolution UV gratings for astronomical purposes. These processes are derived from the ones we used in creating X-ray gratings and consist of: 1) writing an electron-beam pattern consisting of parallel grooves on a layer of positive resist that has been deposited on a Si substrate. 2) dry etching this profile into a hard mask made of silicon nitride. 3) wet etching with KOH that will create the sawtooth profile at a specific blaze angle thanks to the properties of the different crystallographic planes of silicon. Gratings fabricated using these techniques show an excellent behavior all around, combining the best qualities from both ruled and holographic gratings. Indeed, they display a sharp sawtooth profile, they do not suffer from periodicity errors, and grating facets show low roughness. Recent testing done at UC Boulder shows efficiencies that are close to the maximum, theoretical limit. Combined with the possibility to create custom blaze angles through the use of custom cut Si wafers, this opens the way to new applications in the field of astronomical UV spectroscopy.", "In this paper, patterning challenges that led to the fabrication of a first Spin Torque Majority Gate (STMG) device are explored. We have highlighted key process module developments from the Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) pillar patterning to dual damascene scheme wiring module. Spin devices such as STMG have already been proposed as a replacement for conventional CMOS transistors. The main challenge to their experimental demonstration remains the successful fabrication of connected MTJs through a ferromagnetic layer, allowing spin transport across the gate. We propose a new etching approach utilizing Ion Beam Etching (IBE), to be able to pattern the MTJs with high precision and with less damage to the magnetic layers. Furthermore, we have introduced Electron-beam lithography to further scale down the device geometries. This development paves the way towards a fully integrated STMG device for Spin Logic applications.", "Patterning surface with structural DNA origami mask presents a major interest for nanolithography due to its modularity and high ability to achieve a high resolution with 3-5 nm. In this paper, we demonstrate a sub-ten-nanometer lithography process using anhydrous HF vapor into a SiO2 substrate (figure 1). After optimizing rinsing conditions on SiO2 substrate and HF etching process, we reach a high density (<20 nm pitch) and high resolution (~10 nm CD) patterned surface with a fast etching rate of 0.2 nm.s-1. The resulting SiO2 patterns are used as hard mask in HBr/O2 plasma of Si substrate. Origami pattern features are conserved: lateral dimensions, morphology and structure. For the first time, we developed a high resolution (~10 nm) and high contrast (~65 nm) transfer of patterns into Si substrate. We will highlight the challenges brought by this new technology and demonstrate the feasibility to control this patterning technique. AFM technique has been previously tested to confirm the pattern fidelity. Using all the available imaging capabilities on the CDSEM, we will establish the best method for each layer to achieve the precision required for the targeted nodes of this technology. Beyond the resolution capabilities, the precise placement of the DNA pattern on the substrate is investigated. Based on a pre-patterning step using the nanoimprint technology, the affinity of the DNA with respect to the substrate is locally modified and its influence is analyzed. Thus, DNA origami appears like a promising approach for emerging and engineering of hard mask for patterning.", "The manufacturable integration of geometric, equivalent and 3D scaling will drive Future Beyond CMOS devices and information processing technologies and systems. Additionally, interface control and low-energy functional patterning of non-traditional materials will enable the integration of novel heterogeneous 3D materials and systems. For future patterning technologies, resolution and defectivity, as well as line edge and interface roughness continue as key potential show-stoppers. Furthermore, the current resist-based patterning strategy requires a subsequent pattern transfer step, which adds to the stochastic nature and variability of the patterning and pattern transfer processes, and the challenge of achieving low defect sub-10 nm patterns will only increase with each technology generation. The Internet-of-Things era opens an enormous research space and opportunity for exploring emerging research materials (ERMs) that exhibit the potential for achieving sub-8-nm functional feature sizes via the directed self-assembly of novel non-block copolymer (BCP) and nanomaterials. Utilizing intramolecular hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions as a driving force for self-assembly, we designed and developed a method to fabricate molecular patterning platforms that leverage interactions between bioinspired amphiphilic molecules and various metal cation-conjugates. This system also appears to exhibit a dynamic chi, \u03c7, during the assembly process, which would enhance the formation of highly resolved self-assembled structures. With this method, we were able to demonstrate 2.9\u00b10.8 nm (1\u03c3; n=11) ordered metal/organic line patterns, with a pitch of 7.4\u00b12.0 nm (1\u03c3; n=10), and conductivity through the metal nanowires. While still in the \u2018ugly duckling\u2019 stage of development, this study demonstrates the feasibility of achieving self-assembled sub-4 nm functional nanostructures. This breakthrough technology opens the door to new families of self-assembling materials options, with the potential to serve as an inexpensive and effective way to pattern high-resolution features, such as for nanoelectronics, bioelectronics and other emerging 21st century information processing technologies.", "The ability to further shrink EUVL geometries can be facilitated using multiple lithographic approaches. Most recent proposals suggest an EUVL double patterning strategy. This path requires additional and expensive EUVL tool time. In our work, using an EUVL patterned polymer as a guide material with DSA incorporated into the lithography flow is an optional process mitigating EUVL tool time. Multiple variations of BCP (block copolymers) were successfully tested. In addition, pattern transfer through silicon containing hard mask and spin on carbon layers was demonstrated with minimum LER (line edge roughness) and good critical dimension uniformity (CDU).", "Three-color lithography (3CL) produces features on the scale of tens of nanometers using visible light. In this technique, one beam pre-activates a photoresist, a second beam deactivates it, and a third beam activates the pre-activated regions that have not been deactivated. The deactivation beam trims features, allowing for improved feature size and resolution. Creating permeable thin films enables us to further control feature size using oxygen as a quencher. We will discuss these thin-film studies, which are a promising step towards large-area patterning.", "In this work, an evaluation of various adhesion promoters (or primers) for soft ultra-violet (UV) nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is reported. The evaluation is performed using 200 mm wafer scale in the HERCULES\u00ae NIL equipment platform available at the CEA-Leti. First, surface energies of the primers are determined through contact angle measurements. Next, atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements were carried out to evaluate the surface uniformity and roughness of the primed wafers. Thin film thickness measurements were performed by spectroscopic ellipsometry in order to select the most promising primer processes for high resolution etch mask and permanent applications. Afterwards, the adhesion layer performances of the selected primer processes were evaluated by an imprint test using a dedicated patterned master (critical dimension down to 30 nm and aspect ratios up to 1.5). Optical and scanning electron microscope (SEM) defect reviews were systematically performed. This evaluation enabled to benchmark several adhesion promotor solutions based on the grafted technology developed by ARKEMA in order to identify an efficient adhesive layer compatible with various NIL resists and substrates, such as silicon based materials or glass.", "In recent years, nanoimprint lithography is applied to manufacturing of optical materials and biosensor. However, void and generated gas are caused pattern failures. We proposed cellulose based gas permeable molds to reduce pattern failures. In this research we could raise the mold reproducibility by using the under-layer coating and liquid release agent. It was confirmed that imprinting materials including 10 wt% each of acetone, cyclopentane, and propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) as volatile solvents could also be imprinted accuracy and number of imprinting times were increased. In addition, we succeeded in expand the cellulose based gas permeable mold size 5 times as compared with the conventional cellulose based gas permeable mold by using step and repeat process and large scale quartz mold. Various manufacturing can be expected by increasing the repeatability and the pattern area of the cellulose based gas permeable mold.", "Imprinting micro- and nanostructures on non-planar surfaces has gained prominence in various fields such as optoelectronics, photonics and biomedical implants. It has been implemented for applications such as optical sensor arrays and optical fibers. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a low cost, high resolution nanofabrication process. In this work, soft UV-NIL process is used in which a flexible stamp is used which makes it ideal for imprinting on curved surfaces such as plano-convex lens. However, the substrate to stamp positioning for successful transfer of patterns is crucial and needs to be addressed. The Nanopositioning and Nanomeasuring machine (NPMM), developed in the Collaborative Research Center (of the German Research Foundation) of TU Ilmenau, provides a unique solution to the challenges of positioning and alignment. Therefore, a UV-LED assisted small scale NIL-setup was designed, developed and integrated into the NPMM and it was further realized for carrying out fabrication of micro- and nanostructures on silicon chips and planoconvex lenses. In addition to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization, the structures were further characterized using a focus sensor. The utilized focus sensor is an optical sensor developed at the Institute for Process Measurement and Sensor Technology of TU Ilmenau. It was observed that the imprinted structures were of considerably good fidelity. Thus, a distinctive integrated imprinting process for flat and non-flat surfaces was developed and implemented.", "A high-power LED-based illumination system has been developed as a replacement for the mercury arc lamps used in mask-aligner lithography. LEDs are arranged in a grid array and placed in the entrance aperture of individual reflectors. Those reflectors decrease the angular extent of the light. With this multisource approach, different groups of LEDs can be switched on independently. The illumination patterns created determine the illumination angles and the spatial coherence in the mask plane. The spatial coherence is measured in the mask plane by using a circular double slits approach. The interference pattern for different illumination patterns are measured, showing the effect of the asymmetry and size of the angular extent of the illumination light. The effect of the different illumination patterns on the quality of the prints are also illustrated with print tests.", "CMOS imaging has experienced significant developement in the last decades. At the center of this progress lies the pixel, composed of a light sensitive area (photodiode) coupled to a network of transistors. As the pixels sizes shrink, the light sensitive area gets smaller and requires light focusing assistance. To address this issue, microlenses are added to the top of the pixels stack. The microlenses are made of polymer resist transparent to the wavelength of interest. Creating such structures is not straightforward and requires complex process steps, especially when arrays of multiple shapes and sizes are needed. The grayscale approach appears as a promising alternative since this unconventional lithography method can produce variable shapes and sizes in a single lithography step. Mask data preparation is the most critical step for grayscale lithography. A widespread strategy is to experimentally establish the relationship between a given dose (corresponding to a specific chromium density on the mask) and the remaining resist thickness after development. The relationship, also known as contrast curve, is used as a transfer function to compute a suitable mask for the given resist. Our approach is to create a simplified grayscale model able to predict the resist response under any given mask and illumination condition. Using the classic contrast curve approach we have designed a mask composed of sub 5\u03bcm patterns and evaluated the resist profile prediction of the contrast curve approach compared to our grayscale model on various patterns including microlenses, pyramids and bowl shapes. Reults show that the contrast curve approach is no longer appropriate when the dimensions reduce below 5\u03bcm.", "Tilted ion implantation (TII) used in conjunction with pre-existing masking features on the surface of a wafer is a promising cost-effective method for self-aligned double-patterning. Recent work experimentally demonstrated pitch-halving by masked TII into a thermally grown SiO2 hard-mask layer: the wet etch rate of SiO2 increases dramatically if the implant-induced damage exceeds a threshold level, so that implanted regions (vs. non- implanted SiO2 regions) can be selectively removed in dilute hydrofluoric acid solution. In this work, this method is extended to a silicon anti-reflection coating (SiARC) deposited by spin-coating and processed at temperatures compatible with back-end-of-line processing. Negative-tone patterning is achieved by implanting a 10 nm-thick SiARC film with Ar+ species at low energies (less than 5 keV) to reduce the wet etch rate. In general, the higher the implant dose, the greater the etch rate contrast between implanted vs. non-implanted regions of the SiARC layer. In principle, the TII method can be extended to form patterns with dimensions that extend in two orthogonal directions, i.e., two-dimensional (2D) patterns. In this work, the use of TII for 2D patterning is investigated via Monte Carlo simulations to study the effect of implantation dose and varying degrees of overlap between implanted regions extending along orthogonal directions. Stochastic effects on pattern fidelity are systematically investigated. The capability of TII to form sub-lithographic 2D patterns makes it advantageous for extending the era of Moores Law.", "NIL patterns frequently suffer from the presence of defects such as missing lines or dots which degrade their properties and functionality. Due to their low density and nanosize, the measurement of their fraction is challenging nanometrology trade-off between resolution and measurement range. In this paper, we focus on the use of range-limited SEM images and explore the benefits of a computational modeling approach to simulate the measurement process and estimate the statistics and accuracy of the measurement of missing lines in patterns. The main questions we address have to do with the choice of the parameters available in the measurement process such as the number of acquired images, their magnification defining the lines included in images and the position (overlapped or not) at line pattern. The missing lines can have both uncorrelated and correlated positions in pattern. In the case of positive correlations, the defects are aggregated whereas in the opposite case of negative correlations they are arranged in periodic-like positions. We found that for uncorrelated defects, the critical parameter is the total number of lines included in the measurement process while the image position do not have any impact on the measurement accuracy. On the contrary, when correlations in defect positions are considered, the number of images and the number of lines per image differentiate their effects on the accuracy of the result while the arrangement of images along pattern also plays a crucial role in the measurement process.", "EUV lithography and multi patterning introduce variability often referred to as EUV and Etch stochastics. These consume a large part of the EPE (Edge Placement Error) budget. To bring EPE to the necessary specifications, the industry needs to minimize the key EPE contributors of CD, Overlay, pattern placement, pitch-walk, and LER. The challenge is that these attributes are being gauged by different metrology technologies, thus just matching these different metrology techniques might consume the entire EPE budget. Hence, the industry has sought solutions presented in this work that are capable of measuring the above attributes of EPE from a single image. The study presented will then investigate weather measuring all of EPE on a scribe like target introduces a pitch dependent bias that could be rid of - if all of EPE was measured on device. The paper will show data from thousands of EUV vias over multi-patterned interconnects of a real device. Once established that measuring on device is not prone to pitch dependent bias. The work will compare measuring and correcting EPE at ADI - after develop inspection, to reduce the time to accuracy compared to known methods of measuring accuracy, only at AEI, after etch. An attempt is made to investigate weather after etch accuracy methods used today insert a litho to etch metrology driven bias. After walking the audience through an EPE metrology budget minimization flow based on real images and data, the paper will look for further opportunities to minimize EPE at the source, such as self-aligned processes, beyond litho, specifically discussing spacer uniformity, and etch slant control versus overlay.", "Metal containing resists (MCR) are one of the candidates for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) resists aiming to achieve the resolution, linewidth roughness and sensitivity (RLS) requirements of advanced design nodes. MCRs intrinsically have high etch resistance owing to their metal content. Therefore, low resist thickness (~18nm) is sufficient to transfer resist patterns into an underlying hard mask. Also, the thin resist reduces susceptibility to pattern collapse during development because of low aspect ratio. However, thus far little attention has been paid to optical metrology and inspectability (overlay, defect inspection, scatterometry, etc.) of these resists, which is another critical requirement to move MCR toward high volume manufacturing (HVM).\nIn this paper, we investigate overlay metrology and overlay correction with MCR. Even though the optical contrast for MCR is slightly lower than for chemically amplified resist (CAR) it seemed sufficient for high-quality overlay metrology. However, the measurement precision for MCR is deteriorated compared to that for CAR, resulting in significantly higher residuals. The root cause of the deteriorated measurement precision was found in grains in the optical image after MCR development. Interestingly, the after etch performance of CAR and MCR is identical. We demonstrate that with sufficient sampling, appropriate correctables can be extracted from the MCR overlay results. Finally, we discuss how the increased image noise can be compensated by the applied sampling scheme.", "Shrinking on-product overlay (OPO) budgets in advanced technology nodes require more accurate overlay measurement and better measurement robustness to process variability. Pupil-based accuracy flags have been introduced to the scatterometry-based overlay (SCOL) system to evaluate the performance of a SCOL measurement setup. Wavelength Homing is a new robustness feature enabled by the continuous tunability of advanced SCOL systems using a supercontinuum laser light source in combination with a flexible bandpass filter. Inline process monitoring using accuracy flags allows for detection, quantification and correction of shifts in the optimal measurement wavelength. This work demonstrates the benefit of Wavelength Homing in overcoming overlay inaccuracy caused by process changes and restoring the OPO and residual levels in the original recipe.", "In next generation 3D-NAND devices, accurately determining after-etch overlay for the multi-layer stack is a major challenge. This is especially the case for the multi-tier 3D-NAND structures, where the overlay of the channel holes is an important performance parameter. The most commonly used after-etch metrology suffer both from the high aspect ratio of the channel holes and from the potential presence of large tilts.\nUsing In-Device Metrology (IDM), we show results of non-destructive overlay measurements on 3D-NAND memory holes. Once the overlay signal has been determined, the remaining asymmetry information in the measurement can be used to characterize tilt phenomena densely through the memory array.\nUsing hyper-dense in-device measurements show the overlay effects of intra-die stress. A new lithography scanner model is used to correct specifically for such intra-die overlay fingerprints.", "A standalone alignment technology was developed as a fundamental solution to improve on-product overlay (OPO). It enables high performance alignment measurements, and delivers state-of-the-art feed-forward corrections to exposure scanners. Dense alignment sampling and high order alignment correction is effective for scanner fingerprint matching and for correcting heavy distortion at a wafer edge. A mark asymmetry correction is detailed as effective solution which improves the OPO performance for heavily processed wafers. An OPO test result showed significant improvement using its feed-forward corrections. A high accuracy topography sensor is described as a new metrology innovation. The standalone alignment technology provides critical metrology tool functions such as process monitoring as well.", "Voids in copper lines are a common failure mechanism in the back end of line (BEOL) of integrated circuits manufacturing, affecting chip yield and reliability. As subsequent process nodes continue to shrink metal line dimensions, monitoring and control of these voids gain more and more importance [1]. Currently, there is no quantitative in-line metrology technique that allows voids to be identified and measured. This work aims to develop a new method to do so, by combining scatterometry (also referred to as Optical Critical Dimension or Optical CD) and low-energy x-ray fluorescence (LE-XRF), as well as machine learning techniques. By combining the inputs from these tools in the form of hybrid metrology, as well as with the incorporation of machine learning methods, we create a new metric, referred to as Vxo, to characterize the quantity of void. Additionally, the results are compared with inline electrical test data, as higher amounts of voids were expected to increase the measured resistivity. This was not found to be the case, as the impact of the voids was much less of a factor than variation in the cross-sectional area of the lines.", "Critical dimension scanning electron microscopes (CD-SEMs) are widely used as the tool for measuring the actual size, shape, and roughness of device patterns in the semiconductor manufacturing. In order to obtain an image with a high sig-nal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the usage of higher electron beam current or the averaging operation of scanning frames (long observation time) are carried out. Such methods, however, could increase the sample charging effects. In recent years, the application of deep learning to translation problems from images to images has attracted attention. Isola et al. have proposed the conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as a general-purpose solution of trans-lation problems. The cGANs are shown in figure 1 [1]. The generative adversarial network (GAN), that has become the basis of the cGANs, consists of a generator G and a discriminator D. The generator G translates input images to plausible images. The discriminator D tries to distinguish real images from the image synthesized by the generator G while the gen-erator aims to generate plausible images as possible to fool the discriminator. Just as GANs, the cGANs learn a conditional generative model. This makes cGANs suitable for image-to-image translation task. For the generator, a \u201cU-Net\u201d-based architecture is used. For the discriminator, a convolutional \u201cPatchGAN\u201d classifier is used, which only penalizes structure at the scale of image patches. They have shown that this approach is effective on a wider range of problems. In this paper, we try to improve the quality (high resolution and high SNR) of a low-quality SEM image using the cGAN. In the training process, two kinds of images, low-quality images observed with low magnification and low SNR and corresponding high-quality images with high magnification and high SNR, are used. In the estimation process, an in-put low-quality SEM image is translated (outputted) to the high-quality image. Here we report the simulation results. Figure 2 shows a part of the training dataset that includes isolated single line. The high (upper row) and low (lower row) quality SEM images consist of 512 x 512 and 256 x 256 pixels, respectively. In the training, 3600 pairs (high and low) were used. Figure 3 shows an example of results. (a) is the low-quality input image, (b) the output image by the cGAN, and (c) the corresponding high-quality image (not used in the training). It is seen that the quality of the input image is improved to a degree close to the quality of the high-quality image while maintaining the outline of line edge roughness. [1] P. Isola, J.-Y. Zhu, T. Zhou, and A. A. Efros, arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.07004 (2016).", "Metrology of most advanced CMOS devices poses more and more challenges: lithography and etch patterning processes need to be controlled on critical parameters that -beyond critical dimensions (CD)- nowadays also include line width and line edge roughness (LWR/LER), multiple patterning induced pitch-walk and, due to the high aspect ratio of the patterned structures, also thermo-mechanical structural bending.\nIn this paper, it is shown that sufficient sampling is required to ensure that scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) does provide relevant information about the dimensions and chemical composition of the advanced devices. While, in principle, STEM can measure device dimensions with Angstrom resolution and sub-nm precision, a single measurement will not be representative for the device dimensions that are known to vary statistically (LER/LWR) as well as systematically (Pitch-walk, structural bending).\nIn this context, the metrology capabilities of a (calibrated) automated 80-200kV STEM with Cs aberration corrector and a high efficiency EDS detector have been evaluated for both STEM-EDS and STEM-HAADF acquisitions. It will be shown that, when measuring multiple (~ 400) individual FinFET structures (Silicon Fins / dummy Silicon gate lines), average CD, LER and LWR can be quantified from the distribution of measured line widths and line pitches, that SADP and SAQP induced pitch-walk may show up as multi-modal pitch distributions, and that pitch walking can be quantified if also structural bending, that is observed, is properly taken into account.\nFinally, the STEM and EDS metrology capabilities for FinFET and NanoWire (NW) device structures are reviewed for different use cases (statistical process control and technology development support) and with different indicators (Precision over Tolerance ratio (P/T) and Variability ratio (r = 1 \u2013 \u03c32 metrology / \u03c32 measured process )).", "The control of edge placement error (EPE) is playing key role in the patterning of advanced technology node in semiconductor industry. EPE is evaluated by the metric of overlay, distance of patterns between two layers in multi patterning, and patterning error in local area. In past instance, overlay between upper layer and underlayer was measured by electron beam (e-beam) metrology system with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image.\nEPE which is caused by local patterning error on photoresist layer is influenced by scanner tool parameters such as focus and exposure. Technology and method of EPE measurement on photoresist layer is highly required to optimize scanner tool performance.\nThis study provides the measurement method of EPE on photoresist layer resulting from variation of scanner tool condition. Definition of EPE in this study is the distance between contour of SEM pattern and contour of target layout. Die to Database (D2DB) technology which compares image and layout data was applied to this study with large image size which include huge number of patterns. The advantage of the method was confirmed by the experiment on the verification of local patterning error.\nThe result of the experiment shows scanner tool conditions are well represented by these local patterning errors. In addition, optimizing scanner parameters and monitoring scanner condition by these local patterning errors are proposed.", "Stochastic print failures are a serious potential yield limiter for the 5 nm and 3 nm technology node. To attain the detection limits that ensure yield requires inspection of square centimeters of area, which will challenge even the fastest anticipated e-beam tools. Optical techniques help but lack the ability to resolve actual defects. Applying super-resolution fluorescence nanoscopy techniques may provide a solution for both rapid inspection and defect identification capable of inspecting hundreds of wafers per hour. The technique first developed by Stephan Hell in 1994 for the life sciences uses the ability to toggle a molecules fluorescence on and off by activating with actinic light and deactivating via stimulated-depletion. By surrounding activating light with deactivating light, the former\u2019s spot size reduces to nanometers allowing resolutions that far exceed the Abbe limit. In 2014, Professor Hell shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for this technique, Stimulated-Emission-Depletion, STED nanoscopy. This paper will explain the technique, propose a method in its use for the inspection of EUV resists, and demonstrate proof-of-concept where we imaged with 775 nm deactivation and 640 nm activation morphological structures in a polymer film that are smaller than 5 nm.", "With growing process complexity and the increasing number of process steps, early prediction of device performance has become an important task in semiconductor manufacturing process control. Machine learning (ML) techniques allow us to link in-line measurements to End-Of-Line (EOL) electrical tests. In our paper, we use reflectance spectra obtained from the scatterometry tool to predict both metal-line resistance and capacitance. We used IMEC N14 process flow with LELE double patterning at the M1 stage. Special designs-of-experiments (DOE) for multiple parameters allowed us to create a metrology solution for the entire process window and test its accuracy for all POI. Induced variations of both line CDs and space CDs, together with specially designed measurement sites, created wide variations both in metal-line resistance and capacitance. Reflectance spectra were collected in-line at two process steps defining metal lines: HM etch and Cu CMP at multiple targets, including E-test measurement sites, together with reference metrology for overlay (OV) and CD (by using Diffraction-Based-Overlay (DBO) and CD SEM). EOL electrical test results were used for the ML training procedure for early prediction of patterning effects (both CD and OL) on electrical performance enabling early decisions and cost reduction by discarding out-of-spec wafers before they reached the electrical test. It was shown that ML OCD predictive techniques are complimentary to the OCD model-based solutions for geometrical parameters widely used for in-line APC.", "Full abstract not available at present - I will submit it this week or early next week.", "Up until now, the main driving force for the semiconductor industry is the continual shrinkage of device feature sizes, thereby incorporating more devices per unit area, reducing manufacturing cost and enhancing their performance have been achieved. However, the shrinkage of feature size leads to a reduction of process window imposing an extremely tight requirement for parameters such as critical dimension (CD), edge and width roughness of spaces/trenches, contacts, lines, and tip to tip (T2T) values. At sub 14 nm technology nodes these parameters have a significant influence on the overall device performance. With EUV based pattering becoming the sole option at these advanced nodes, a thorough characterization of the patterning process is of utmost importance before it can be a high-volume manufacturing solution.\nIn this work, we show how e-beam inspection has been used to characterize a single exposure EUV M2 (Metal 2 layer, BEoL) to have an understanding of the different hotspots and intra-field signatures present. Design Based Metrology (DBM) with wide SEM image was employed to measure CD distribution and Edge Placement Error (EPE) distribution of metal layer pattern on the 10nm logic wafer.", "Process monitoring of critical dimensions and structural shapes in 3D NAND flash memory device manufacturing requires the precision, resolution, and speed of SEM image acquisition and metrology, with new challenges in the Z axis, as device capacity continues to grow. Automated, gas assisted PFIB surface preparation enables sampling at multiple, arbitrary heights in the memory cell stack at a rate fast enough support inline process control. This work reports on preparation and measurement of greater than 2000 devices, from three sites, at 3 layers, in <140 minutes from a commercially available 64 layer 3D NAND device. Automated SEM metrology is used as a fast and accurate method of surface analysis to determine the planar cell area, ellipsis, and position of the bits as a function of depth within the stack. These results and extended analyses provide insight into how the shape and size of the primary etch channel influences memory cell dimensional variation as a function of depth.", "Standard wafers with programmed defects (PDs) were fabricated to evaluate charge control techniques, resolution, and defect detection capabilities of pattern inspection tools for 7-nm and smaller nodes. To evaluate charge control techniques, the PDs were formed in line and space (LS) patterns. PDs were also formed below contact holes as programmed etching residues. These PDs were detected by a voltage contrast inspection technique. Image distortion by charging was also evaluated with the use of a wafer in a multibeam secondary electron microscope (SEM) and projection type inspection systems. Patterns with PDs were also formed on different subsurface structures. The effects of subsurface structures on the defect detection capability were evaluated based on this wafer. Another type of wafer having small defects approximately 5 nm in size on 16- to 12-nm half pitch (hp) LS patterns on a 12-inch Si-wafer, was fabricated by electron beam lithography. This wafer allowed evaluation of the defect detection capability of PDs having different shapes and sizes, such as protrusion, intrusion, bridge and open defects, on dense patterns for 7-nm and smaller nodes. Moreover, extremely small protrusion defects, with a size of 1 nm, and small bridge defects (as narrow as 1 nm) were also fabricated into LS patterns with ultra-low line-edge-roughness on a Si (110) substrate. This patterned substrate was mounted into a 12-inch Si wafer, and we evaluated the performance of tools for 12-inch wafer fabrication. We proposed a method to verify the true LER/LWR by CD-SEM measurements.", "Even though instrumentation for electron beam lithography (EBL) has progressed immensely since it was first introduced almost 50 years ago[1], enabling beam spot sizes below 5 nm for certain systems, its lithographic resolution limits are still bound by the primary and secondary electron scattering processes that occur when a specific resist is exposed. As the feature sizes become smaller and resists designed with higher sensitivities, these stochastic processes play an increasing role in the resulting line edge roughness (LER) thus leading to an effect known as shot noise. Unfortunately, unraveling the impact of these processes from the impact of the development step is partly hindered by our inability to measure the 3D profile of the latent image from resists directly after exposure. Furthermore, given the recent rise of chemically-amplified resists (CARs) used for the next generation extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), it has become even more critical to find ways to characterize and investigate the shot noise effect. In this work, we tackle this challenge by applying the resonant soft x-ray scattering (RSoXS) technique in a grazing incidence configuration to extract the cross-sectional profile of resists that have already been patterned, but have yet to be developed (i.e., latent image). We find that the difference in chemistry induced by the chain scission process in exposed PMMA and CAR resists is enough to produce enough scattering contrast at certain X-ray energies near the absorption edge of carbon in order to provide a latent image profile of the pattern with sub-nanometer resolution. In this paper, we will compare the latent image profiles extracted from this RSoXS data to the profiles obtained after development, as well as expand on the nature of this chemical contrast mechanism. We will show how this scattering data may be interpreted and the information used to shed light on the nature of the resolution limit of a specific combination of resist and exposure plus development conditions. Finally, we will elaborate on the impact of the measurement itself on the resulting pattern morphology as well as how similar insights might be gained across other types of resists. 1. Hans C.

The experimental results show a significant improvement in the quality of the image, which leads to a more accurate and reliable CD and overlay measurement.", "Extracting quantitative information about dimensions and material properties of buried structures is continuing to be an important but difficult task in metrology. Examples of questions asking for this capability include critical dimension metrology of fins such as the profile (bottom width, top width, height) or the presence and extent of voids. In recent years TNO has demonstrated the concept of using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in combination with ultrasound to image buried structures based on their (visco-)elasticity in a technique called Subsurface Scanning Ultrasound Resonance Force Microscopy (SSURFM). We have successfully imaged structures less than 10nm wide, as well as structures buried up to a micrometer deep. However, extracting quantitative information from this data is not trivial, as the induced stress field in the sample depends on many parameters in a non-linear way: experimental parameters such as applied force, tip size and tip shape, and geometry and material properties of the buried structures themselves. Therefore, measurements based on this technique have a point spread function which varies in a complicated way with the sample properties that need to be measured. However, a solid understanding of the physics and mechanics involved, and the modeling of the expected structures and their response to externally applied stress, enable quantitative measurements. We specifically show our progress on characterizing a sample comprising fins from a 7nm node manufacturing test run.", "The epitaxial growth of source/drain structures demands a process with tight control of boron and germanium composition to ensure consistent device performance. However, in-line monitoring of the epitaxial composition in FINFET structures has been one of the most difficult challenges for both process development and manufacturing. Traditional in-line monitoring schemes have relied heavily on critical dimension (CD) measurements, with no composition information. Instead, composition information was provided by offline analysis techniques such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), which is destructive and does not measure the composition directly on the FinFET device structure. In this paper, we present results from in-line X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on FinFET structures. This technique is not only sensitive to individual element abundance but also gives information related to the local chemical environment. For this application we monitored silicon, germanium, and boron concentrations in SiGeB EPI source/drain 3D structure without interference from other structural features in the logic device. The in-line XPS measurement of PFET EPI boron and germanium performed in this way on the full structure transistor has been demonstrated to correlate with CMOS device performance, thus significantly reducing time to detect epitaxial composition drift or excursion.", "Here we describe a methodology for molecular analysis at the nano-scale and present its capabilities. The analysis method is based on secondary ion mass spectrometry, SIMS, with gold nanoparticles (e.g. Au4004+). The methodology presented here has unique features which enable molecular analysis at the nanoscale, namely the method of acquiring the mass spectrum and the nature of the impacting projectile. In the method a sequence of individual gold nanoparticles (Au4004+) are used to bombard the sample, each impact results in ion emission from an area 10-20 nm in diameter. For each of impact of Au4004+, the emitted ions are mass analyzed by time of flight mass spectrometry, detected and stored together in one mass spectrum prior to the arrival of the subsequent projectile. Each mass spectrum contains elementals, and molecules which were co-localized within 10-20 nm of one another. Examining the co-emitted ions allows to test the molecular homogeneity, and chemical composition at the nanoscale. We applied this method to a chemically amplified resist before and after exposure and development. After development the method was used to chemically characterize defect sites, which were not removed by the developing solution.", "Background: The measurement of line-edge and linewidth roughness of small features for semiconductor manufacturing is commonly accomplished using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). But these measurements are biased by the noise inherent in SEM imaging.\nAim: Unbiasing of roughness measurements is best accomplished by taking advantage of the frequency characteristics of the noise to measure and subtract it out. This requires the ability to detect edges in a noisy SEM image without the use of standard image filtering techniques\n. Approach: A physics-based inverse linescan model is used to robustly detect edges in high-noise SEM images without the use of filtering or image averaging. To validate the efficacy of SEM noise measurement and subtraction, rough features were measured under a wide variety of SEM settings, including number of frames of averaging and voltage.\nResults: In all cases, the vast majority of the measurement bias was properly subtracted out. Over a wide range of SEM settings the biased roughness varied by more than a factor of two, but the unbiased linewidth roughness varied by only a few percent.\nConclusions: The approach of inverse-linescan edge detection followed by noise measurement and subtraction leads to reliable estimates of the true (unbiased) line-edge and linewidth roughness of features on the wafer. These unbiased estimates are quite insensitive to metrology tool settings over a reasonable range of values.", "In the next generation SAOP (Self-aligned Octuplet patterning) process, the line width and LWR (Line Width Roughness) measurement of lines with sub-10 nm is required. We have already proposed a novel method of line width and LWR measurement with sub-nanometer uncertainty by using FIB (Focused Ion Beam) processing, and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) images as reference metrology. In the previous report, we applied the method to SAQP features. A specimen of the SAQP FinFET line and space device is coated with carbon and cut horizontally into a thin planar sample by the FIB sampling system. The thin sample is observed by using planar-TEM. The average PSD of LWR of SAQP FinFET sample at the upper and lower positions calculated from planar-TEM images. In this article, we apply the methodology to line width and roughness measurement of advanced features by SAOP process. The features are vertically or horizontally sliced as a thin specimen by FIB micro sampling system. LWR is calculated from the edges positions, and PSD (Power Spectrum Density) is analyzed for the reference metrology.", "As the lithographically manufactured nanostructures are shrinking in size, conventional techniques, such as Scanning Electron Microscopes and Atomic Force Microscopes reach their resolution limits [1]. Novel inline scatterometry techniques not only provide the opportunity to bridge this gap, but they can also advance characterization of the lithographic process. The particular, Critical-Dimension Grazing incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (CDGISAXS) has emerged as one such promising modality to extract the profile of line gratings [2]. With the advent of brighter x-ray sources with tunable energies and faster detectors, there is a possibility for combining fast X-ray acquisition with high-speed data treatment to reach the timescale for an effective in-line characterization method. Due to recent progress in the ability to model data acquired from CD-GISAXS, we extended our model in order to study the impact of roughness. A set of twelve samples were studied. First, periodic line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) were measured, leading to the apparition of several semi-circle of Bragg spots as illustarted on Figure 1a. Using HIpGISAXS software, the GISAXS patterns were reproduced, allowing the extract of the periodicity of the roughness. On the second part of the line gratings, aperiodic roughness were designed with different frequencies and amplitudes. These samples led to the superposition of a semi-circle of Bragg spots with a \u201cpalm tree\u201d feature coming from the profile of the gratings, illustarted on figure 1b. In a fist step, we extracted the in-depth profile of the gratings by fitting the modulations of the palm tree, in a similar approach as the CD-GISAXS one. In a second step, we modeled the impact of the roughness on the CD-GISAXS pattern and proposed a model to extract the roughness amplitude and frequency. References: [1] ITRS (2013).

No special edge-detection, simulation modeling, beam-scan, nor image processing is required, except optimization of beam-dose parameters. For instance, threshold method that is a conventional edge-detection is used on SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) image taken by a conventional beam-scanning with a conventionally used beam-conditions. However, especially for EUV-lithographed features we must determine carefully landing voltage and beam-dose that cause artificial reduction of LER and LWR (Line Width Roughness) due to shrink of photo resist materials. Note that we made edge-detection interval at every 5 nm, that is as small as probe-beam diameter. For instance, we set the vertical magnification, the pixel-density, and the sum-line-per-point parameter at 52.7k, 1024, and 2, respectively. Although we can make the interval as small as sub-nanometer, it is not reliable to measure the sub-nanometer object that is only one-tenth of the probe-beam diameter. Then, we verified accuracy of our unbiased LWR by using two independent experimental methods: TEM and FIB-SEM. We obtained spectra of PSD (Power Spectrum Density) from the TEM, the FIB-SEM and our unbiassing CDSEM-method. We found the three PSDs agreed very well to each others. This result strongly implies that three independent methods measured an identical PSD, of true LWR. By our unbiassing CDSEM-method we can measure the true LWR which is calculated from the true PSD. In this work, by using the similar experimental-methods we verify accuracy of our wiggling measurement. Wiggling is a hot issue in production yield of post dry-etch process. Especially about 20 nm or less in the line-width, wiggling starts appearing due to decreased elastic-stiffness of the line feature. A reason why we study the accuracy of LER, LWR, and wiggling is inline monitor of stochastic failures. As they increase significantly in EUV lithography process, production yield may not be promising. Bisshop et al. [1] investigated pitch and/or space-width correlate to incidence of stochastic-failures, such as breaking-line and bridging-line, down to ppm (parts per million). However, the incidence of the stochastic failures should be reduced less to ppb (parts per billion) or ppt (parts per trillion) which is as small as tolerable particle contamination on a wafer. This implies significance of accurate LWR and/or wiggling monitor because in narrow line or space a-few-nanometer-LWR narrows locally them the more and causes the more stochastic failures. In this work, in order to control ppb-stochastic failures we figure out a correlation between LWR and the failures\u2019 incidence. We need to measure billions of features, that requires too long measurement time for practical process-monitor. To shorten the measurement time we test an effective method to estimate such very few number of failures.

In fact, more and more efforts aiming to decouple mask and / or metrology contribution from wafer data have been recently reported [1]. However, these approaches often rely heavily on extensive mask characterization, something that is not always easily available.\nWe propose here an alternative path to investigate and discriminate the root causes of LWR using only wafer data. It is based on Local Critical Dimension Uniformity (LCDU) decomposition [2], a methodology used to identify and quantify the individual LCDU contributors. The decomposition approach requires a smart sampling of the wafer print, in which an array of contact hole is measured in different dies multiple times. For such an approach to be successful, it is critical to ensure that the measurement locations are individually identified. Hence, it is necessary to anchor the metrology to a reference feature. A linear nested model [3] is then used to quantify the three main variability components (mask, shot noise, and metrology). This approach allows to sample thousands of features at mask, a task that would not be practically achievable through direct mask measurements.\nIn this work, LWR decomposition is implemented for the first time. To this aim, 18nm lines at 36nm pitch, printed by EUV lithography, were used. We specifically worked with a pattern including programmed defects, used as anchoring features for the metrology. In order to limit the impact of the metrology noise, expected to be higher for lines as compared to CH, we sampled over 8000 anchored measurements per image (in the CH case, only 81 measurements per image were needed). The LWR decomposition results indicated the dominance of the metrology noise, as expected. In addition, the mask contribution was observed to be less relevant that the shot noise.\nTo verify the accuracy of the LWR decomposition results, Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis on wafer and mask SEM images was used. The metrology noise contribution was removed at both mask and wafer level using an un-biasing normalization of the PSD curves [4]. The comparison with the PSD analysis confirmed the feasibility of LWR decomposition, opening the way to a more effective diagnostic technique for roughness and stochastics.", "For the most advanced nodes, line roughness reaches the same order of magnitude as the CD. It results in a huge impact on power consumptions and leads to some device failures. Hence, the control of this morphological aspect needs an adapted metrology. CD-SEM is considered as an adapted technique for roughness extraction. It is based on the PSD extraction that allows to obtain roughness information in frequency domain. CD-SAXS has been mentioned as one of the highest potential techniques for microelectronics by ITRS with an expected resolution better than one angstrom. The study presented in this article is based on programmed roughness simulations and first experimental measurements. It demonstrates that a complete PSD can also be extracted from a CD-SAXS analysis and that extended information of roughness can be so deduced. Comparison of SEM and SAXS proves the capability of SAXS technique for the PSD extraction of line roughness. Next challenges to improve this extraction are mentioned.", "We have investigated the contributions of surface effects to Monte Carlo simulations of top-down scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms in typical simulations assume that the electron is deep in the bulk of the material. In this work, we correct the inelastic model for surface effects. We use a model for infinite flat surfaces, and apply it to non-flat, but smooth, geometries. Though this is a simplification, it captures most qualitative differences to the bulk model, including coupling to surface plasmons. We find that this correction leads to an increased SE signal near a feature\u2019s sidewall in low-voltage critical dimension SEM (CD-SEM). The effect is strongest for low beam energies. Due to some of the assumptions in our model, we are unable to quantitatively predict the extent by which the signal from the sidewall is enhanced. The enhancement of signal from the sidewall may be large enough to cause the measured edge position to shift significantly.", "My apologies, the technical abstract will be submitted next week.", "With the rapid advancement of the CMOS technology in the semiconductor industry, innovative device fabrication techniques have led to the development of Nanosheet (NS) FETs and Nanowire (NW) FETs with sub nm dimensions. The application of Mueller Matrix Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (MMSE) based scatterometry simulations to characterize these complex 3D structures is described. Optical model-based simulations were used to investigate sensitivity and limitations of MMSE to characterize small changes in the etching of these NWTS structures. Cross-sectional Scanning Electron Microscopy and Tunneling Electron Microscopy provided a reference technique for the scatterometry simulations. Additionally, sensitivity to the nanowire test structure shape, size of holes, nanosheet thicknesses of each layer and the rounding at the top of the structure were investigated. As a result of this study, we find that Mueller Matrix scatterometry has the sensitivity to monitor dimensional changes during the progression of the selective SiGe etch for the sub surface nanowires and thus provide a reliable measurement method for process control.", "In the microelectronics industry, most of the dimensional metrology relies on Critical Dimension (CD) estimation. These measurements are mainly performed by Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscopy (CD-SEM), because it is a very fast, mainly non-destructive method, and enables direct measurements on wafers. To measure CDs, the distance is estimated between the edges of the observed pattern on a SEM image. As the critical dimension becomes smaller and smaller, the needs for more reliable metrology techniques emerge.\nIn order to obtain more meaningful and reproducible CD measurements regardless of the pattern type (line, space, contact, hole . . . ), one needs to perform a CD measurement at a known and constant height thanks to a methodology that determines the topographic shape of the pattern from SEM images. A SEM capable of bending the electron beam (up to 12\u00b0 in our case) allows to catch images at different angles, giving access to more information. From the analysis of such images, pattern height and sidewall angles can be consequently determined using geometric considerations.1\nUnderstanding interactions between 3D shapes, pattern's material and the electron beam, becomes essential to correlate topography information. A preliminary work based on Monte-Carlo simulations was conducted using JMONSEL, a software developed by the NIST.\nThanks to this analysis, it is possible to determine theoretical trends for different topographies and beam tilt conditions. Thanks to the effects highlighted by simulations, the processing of the tilted beam SEM images will be presented, as well as the method used to create a mathematical model allowing topographic reconstruction from these images. Finally some reconstruction using this model will be shown and compare to reference measurements.\nThe overall flow used to process images is presented. First, images are transformed into grayscale profiles in order to process them. After a smoothing procedure, positional descriptors are computed for specific profile derivatives values. Then, from these descriptors coming from two images of the same pattern taken at different tilt angles, we use a low-complexity linear model in order to obtain the geometrical parameters of the structure. This model is created and calibrated thanks to JMONSEL simulations and then re-calibrated on real silicon patterns.\nWe demonstrate that the use of real SEM images coming from real silicon patterns with our model leads to results that are coherent with conventional 3D measurements techniques taken as reference. Moreover, we are able to make reliable reconstructions on patterns of various heights with a single calibrated model. Our batch of experiment shows a 3-sigma standard deviation of 13% on the estimated height.\nWe also show, thanks to simulations, that we are able to reconstruct the corners rounding (CR) from SEM images. However, because our wafer do not present a variability, the CR measurements still need to be assessed.", "Undetected patterning defects on semiconductor wafers can have severe consequences, both financially and technologically. Industry is challenged to find reliable and easy-to-implement methods for defect detection. In this paper we present robust machine learning techniques that can be applied to classify defect images. We demonstrate the basic principles of an algorithm that uses a convolutional neural network and discuss how such networks can be improved not only in their architecture but also tailored to the specific challenges of defect inspection through more specialized performance metrics. These advances may lead to more cost-efficient measurements by adjusting the decision threshold to minimize the number of wrong defect detections.", "Defects are ubiquitous in the semiconductor industry and detection, classification at various levels is a challenge and requires rigorous sampling. Every technology offers a new challenge in this area and requires numerous hours of setup, debug time for semiconductor integrated chip manufacturers. Intentional defects on patterns at various sizes in comparison to the critical dimension of a particular technology are used to preview their modulation and assess inspection tool performances. Figure 1 shows a few types of intentional defects as designed and their respective manifestation on a photomask. The chart also shows detection and printability limit and it varies by each defect type.1, 2\nIn recent years deep learning has made tremendous progress and has substantially improved the state-of-art in many applications that include object detection, speech recognition, and image classification3 The application and design of these deep learning tools in semiconductor defect recognition can be very useful, as it has the potential to reduce the setup time, cost and improving the overall (defect) detection and classification accuracy.\nIn this work we demonstrate the application of convolution neural networks on e-beam images of intentional defects on various types of patterns. We assess various filters and their outputs at each layer of a custom convolutional neural network (Figure 2) to ultimately improve the architecture and its accuracy. We also demonstrate the relative effectiveness of transfer learning in this application with limited availability of labelled data. Using the architecture illustrated in Figure 2 we are able to achieve a classification accuracy of 95%.", "Optical scatterometry is a method to measure the size and shape of periodic micro- or nanostructures on surfaces. For this purpose the geometry parameters of the structures are obtained by reproducing experimental measurement results through numerical simulations. We compare the performance of Bayesian optimization to different local minimization algorithms for this numerical optimization problem. Bayesian optimization uses Gaussian-process regression to find promising parameter values. We examine how pre-computed simulation results can be used to train the Gaussian process and to accelerate the optimization.", "With the miniaturization of devices, hot spots caused by wafer topology are becoming a problem in addition to hot spots resulting from design, mask and wafer process, and hot spot evaluation of a wide area in a chip is becoming required. Although DBM (Design Based Metrology) is an effective method for evaluating systematic defects of EUV lithography and multi-patterning, it requires a long time to evaluate because it is necessary to acquire a high-SN SEM image captured by a contour extraction for DBM that can handle low-SN SEM image captured by high-speed SEM scanning conditions.\nContour extraction using deep learning possesses high noise immunity and excellent pattern recognition ability, and demonstrates high performance to contour extraction from low SN SEM images and multiple layers pattern ones. The proposed method is composed of annotation operation of SEM image samples, training process using annotation data and SEM image samples, and contour extraction process using the trained outcome. In the evaluation experiment, we confirmed that satisfactory contours are extracted from low SN SEM images and multiple layers pattern ones.", "As the design node of memory device shrinks, OPC model accuracy is becoming ever more critical from development to manufacturing. To improve the model accuracy, more and more physical effects are analyzed and terms for those physical effects are added. But it is unachievable to capture the complete physical effects. In this study, deep neural network is employed and studied to improve model accuracy. Regularization is achieved using physical guidance model. To address overfitting issue, high volume of contour based edge placement (EP) gauges (>10K) are generated using fast eBeam tool (eP5) and metrology processing software (MXP) without increasing turnaround time. It is shown that the new approach improved model accuracy by >47% compared to traditional approach on >1.4K verification gauges.", "As industry prepares to introduce extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology for the coming sub-10-nm lithography, this paper presents metrology approaches that utilize the prevalent Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope (CD-SEM). Two technical approaches will be discussed. One is comprehensive solutions for new EUV characterized features, such as low resist-shrinkage electron beam optics and high efficiency metrology/inspection for EUV process monitoring. The other, like conventional minimization processes, is down-to-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m-order metrology methodologies required for stricter CD process control. This paper is the first to conceptualize specifications for a stringent and multi-index tool matching, namely \u201catomic matching,\u201d which is considered as a crucially important feature of any in-line metrology tools in the EUV era.", "In-line metrology for measuring 3D features of the high aspect ratio (HAR) holes is becoming more challenging due to the development of semiconductor technology, particularly in memory devices. Measurements of the bottom critical dimension (CD), taper angles, and 3D profiles of the HAR holes require new imaging capabilities.\nIn this work, we explore backscattered electron (BSE) imaging and its applicability in 3D metrology of the HAR holes. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the BSE signals emitted from the HAR holes. The simulation results demonstrate that the BSE signal intensity decreases exponentially with increasing the depth of the irradiated location in the HAR holes. Based on the characteristics of the BSE signal intensity, an algorithm utilizing depth-correlated BSE signal intensity was proposed for the 3D metrology of the HAR holes. Furthermore, several types of holes with different taper angles and different bowing profiles were fabricated and experiments were performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The cross-sectional profiles of the fabricated holes which are created using the BSE profiles are matching with the as-cleaved cross section observed by X-SEM. These results demonstrate that the 3D-profile variation of the HAR holes induced by the etching processes can be identified by our approach.", "Deep-learning-based SEM image denoiser Dorin Cerbu1, Sandip Halder1, Philippe Leray1 1IMEC, Kapeldreef 75, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium We report the development of a new method to denoise SEM images with the help of artificial neural networks. Upon using a preprocessing and training scheme tailored for SEM images of structures, most often encountered in semiconductor manufacturing, we can efficiently denoise images affected with varying degrees of noise severity and origin. In the figure below, we show an example of how we can use this filter efficiently to treat noisy images and improve the image quality. This can help in acquisition of more stable and better metrology data. Fig1(a) original image (b) Image which has been denoised using deep-learning based algorithms This development is of utmost importance for the case of post-litho processing step where resist nanostructures when SEM inspected are usually impacted by the electron beam and shrink, hence skewing critical dimension measurements. This is especially true as we push towards sub N-10 nm nodes. Application of our deep-learning processing scheme allows efficient noise reduction on SEM inspection images and helps us discern minor details previously shadowed by noise. This is extremely important as we move towards using EUV in high volume manufacturing. Small details can be crucial to understand the root-cause of stochastic and process defects. In previous work, we have already shown different approaches to understand stochastic defects [1-2]. The goal of this work is to enhance the image quality as much as possible to gain further fundamental understanding on nano-defects. [1] S.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is the equipment most typically used to measure pattern dimensions. The aim of this study is to model and simulate a synthetic SEM image. This is fulfilled by taking into account the physical phenomena that take place in the sample during the scanning of the electron beam. The considered phenomena are the kinetics of the drift and the diffusion of the charges during the scanning and the secondary electrons emission from the sample into the vacuum. A system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is obtained which defines a system that will be solved using the Finite Element Method. The escaping of the secondary electrons is modeled by applying a Robin boundary condition on the top surface of the sample. By computing the secondary electron emission that originates from the sample during the beam scan, a synthetic SEM image is created.", "Device miniaturization and complication is now stimulating the strong needs for the three dimensional (3D) geometry measurement of the structure. Now in the single-nanometer nodes, the CDs need to be known at multiple pattern heights especially in after-etch inspection. This means SEM measurements is expected to provide 3D contours. Unfortunately, CD-SEM is basically top-down imaging tool, therefore the acquired micrograph is the 2D projection of the device structure. Meanwhile, optical CD (OCD) works well to deduce the 3D geometrical parameters. Due to the spot size limitation, however, it is hard to obtain the local variation of the structure, or hard to access in-die metrology data. While TEM or slice and view by FIB-SEM is a reliable option to see the local 3D structure, they are destructive and low in statistics due to the long turn-around time. Therefore the challenge is, how to obtain in-die 3D geometrical information in non-destructive way. The purpose of the present work is to extend CD-SEM capability to extract 3D geometry. The most intuitive approach is the direct imaging, where the structure can be extracted directly from the acquired image. The direct imaging includes, beam tilt SEM and topography detector. While the beam tilt is an intuitive method, at larger tilt over 10 degrees the image blur is unavoidable and the precise metrology application is difficult unless the small tilt angle is enough to see the side wall structure like high-aspect-ratio (HAR) structure over several microns in depth. Topography detector is another well-known approach, and works well for the isolated target like particles or pattern defects. In the smallest spacing, however, characteristic shadow is not created, and the topography extraction is basically difficult. By these reasons, we especially have a strong interest in indirect methods described below. Indirect approach includes model-based geometry matching and hybrid metrology with other reference measurements. In these approaches, it is required to find the characteristic SEM waveform or signal intensity (gray-level) which are sensitive to the target geometry. The sensitivity of the response can be estimated by the simulation models, or the comparison with other 3D measurements tools like OCD or AFM. The concept is the generalization of the model-based library (MBL), where the SEM waveform is compared with pre-calculated library of the waveforms. In our approach, calibration could be done by using simulation data or real 3D profiling data. Another generalization is that a SEM operation condition is also altered to enhance the sensitivity of all the geometrical parameter. For example, by sweeping the beam voltage, the multiple waveforms are obtained and the low voltage data has a sensitivity in the pattern top geometry, and the higher voltage data in the pattern bottom. Similar parameter sweep can be applied to energy-filter voltages or focus heights. It is expected that this sort of the generalization enhances the correctness of the geometry profiles. In the conference presentation, we will compare these 3D measurement approaches and discuss how to realize the reliable in-die 3D measurement in the coming advanced technology nodes.", "Over the past few years, patterning edge placement error (EPE), which combines information on variability of pattern sizes and placement between adjacent device layers, has been established as the key metric for patterning budget generation and holistic patterning control. More recently, the emergence of high-throughput SEM tools that provide inspection and large-volume CD metrology capabilities has enabled unprecedented statistical analysis of on-product pattern variability.\nIn the current paper we address edge placement budget generation as well as potential for improved patterning control for an HVM use case at the 28nm litho node. Edge placement and possible related defect mechanisms arise most critically at the contact layer, where contact hole patterning and EPE, with respect to both underlying gate and active layers need to be well controlled. At the 28nm node and for automotive applications, variability control within 5-sigma, i.e. to failure rates below 1 ppm, is generally required to ensure device reliability.\nTo support generation of an EPE budget by wafer data that captures inter and intra-field components, including local stochastic variations, we use a high-throughput, large field-of-view SEM tool from Hermes Microvision, at all three process layers of interest, as well as YieldStar metrology for overlay characterization. The large volume of data being made available -tens of millions of individual CD measurements- allows mapping out the low-probability ends of variability distributions and detecting non-Gaussian \u2018fat tails\u2019 indicative of defect rates that would be underestimated by 3-sigma estimates. Data analysis includes decomposing the total pattern variations into sources of variability, such as global CDU, mask variations and local stochastics. In addition to established CD metrology, we apply novel SEM image based analysis of repetitive patterns in SRAM arrays to generate 2-dimensional process variability bands, including estimates of pattern placement. This approach allows to investigate in detail the probabilistic interaction between active, gate and contact layers.", "A depth measurement technique for extremely deep holes (such as channel holes in 3D flash memory devices)\u2014by using back-scattered-electron (BSE) images obtained by a high voltage critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CDSEM)\u2014 was developed. A high voltage CD-SEM can detect BSEs that penetrate solids surrounding deep holes. These BSE images include rich information concerning the bottom structures of deep holes. As the BSEs lose their energies according to the distance they travel in solids, it is deduced that the BSE image intensity at hole bottoms depends on hole depth. In a feasibility study on depth measurement using an SEM simulator, it was found that the intensity also depends on hole diameter. The relationship between BSE intensity, hole depth, and hole diameter was modeled by simplifying a backscattering model and approximating the target medium by volume density. Based on this model, a depth measurement technique using only a top-view BSE image is proposed. Measurement error of the technique for channel holes of a 3D flash memory device with depths of a few microns was evaluated by using a high voltage CD-SEM. According to the results of the evaluation, error range was 62 nm and measurement repeatability was \u00b1 18 nm. It is concluded that these values are sufficient for detecting depth defects. This technique achieves fast and non-destructive depth measurement of individual extremely deep holes.", "The scaling of device dimensions has resulted in a need for high resolution metrology techniques capable of measuring small CDs with a high degree of precision and accuracy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has previously been demonstrated to be a metrology technique capable of measuring small CDs and gathering large volumes of accurate and precise metrology data. In addition, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) metrology has also been demonstrated to be a powerful technique enabling the detection and measurement of low contrast layers, specifically for 3D NAND devices. Benchmarking EDS metrology against STEM metrology in terms of precision and accuracy is important to further investigate the capabilities of EDS metrology for the semiconductor industry. This study was performed using the latest technology in EDS detectors, along with automated acquisition and metrology software to generate large metrology data sets on horizontal nanowire structures. In this paper, we present data to support our finding that EDS metrology is well-matched with STEM metrology in terms of both precision and accuracy. In addition, we discuss the capability of EDS and STEM metrology to detect subtle process variations in next-generation logic devices.", "A CD-SEM metrology for an EUV resist that was compatible with low shrinkage and high spatial resolution was investigated by using primary electrons (PEs) with high energy. The shrinkage and an image sharpness were evaluated for the EUV resist using PEs with energies of 200, 800, and 4000 eV. As a result, the smallest shrinkage and image sharpness were obtained under the condition of PEs with an energy of 4000 eV. We believe that a high-voltage CD-SEM is a potential candidate for CD metrology tools in the EUV lithography era.", "Overlay process control is a critical aspect of integrated circuit manufacturing. Advanced DRAM manufacturing overlay error budget approaches the sub-2nm threshold, including all sources of overlay error: litho processing, non-litho processing, metrology error, etc. Overlay measurement quality, both for accuracy and robustness, depends on the metrology system and its recipe setup. The optimal configuration depends on the layer and materials involved. Increased flexibility of metrology setup is of paramount importance, paired with improved methods of recipe optimization.\nBoth optical image-based overlay (IBO) and scatterometry diffraction overlay (SCOL\u00ae) are necessary tools for overlay control. For some devices and layers IBO provides the best accuracy and robustness, while on others SCOL provides optimum metrology. Historically, wavelength selection was limited to discrete wavelengths and at only a single wavelength. At advanced nodes IBO and SCOL require wavelength tunability and multiple wavelengths to optimize accuracy and robustness, as well as options for polarization and numerical aperture (NA). In previous studies1,2,3 we investigated wavelength tunability analysis with landscape analysis, using analytic techniques to determine the optimal setup. In this report we show advancements in the landscape analysis technique for IBO through both focus and wavelength, and comparisons to SCOL. A key advantage of imaging is the ability to optimize wavelength on a per-layer basis. This can be a benefit for EUV layers in combination with those of 193i, for example, as well as other applications such as thick 3D NAND layers. The goal is to make accurate and robust overlay metrology that is immune from process stack variations, and to provide metrics that indicate the quality of metrology performance. Through both simulation and on-wafer advanced DRAM measurements, we show quantitative benefits of accuracy and robustness to process stack variability for IBO and SCOL applications.\nMethodologies described in this work can be achieved using Archer\u2122 overlay metrology systems, ATL\u2122 overlay metrology systems, and 5D Analyzer\u00ae advanced data analysis and patterning control solution.", "The aim of this work is to clarify the quantitative relationship between the Edge Placement Error (EPE) and Line Edge Roughness (LER) in a rough pattern. Using a computational modelling approach to isolate this relationship, we show that despite the dominant role of Rms(LER), EPE is also affected by the correlation length especially at long length of interests. Similarly, we demonstrate and quantify the positive correlation of the edge correlation coefficient with Image Placement Error. The ultimate concern is to get design-rule determinations based on EPE definitions and characterization which is informed by modern manufacturing and metrology aspects of LER.", "The on-product overlay roadmap demands an aggressive overlay requirement in the advanced node. Currently the on-product overlay is dominated by effects coming from wafer processing and overlay target detectability. Processing effects such as symmetric stack variation and asymmetric overlay target deformations are expected to become limiting for accurate overlay measurements in future nodes\n. Increased accuracy requirements and overall complexity in product stacks require a sensor with a higher flexibility. To address this an advanced metrology system is introduced in the fab, providing full flexibility in the selection of measurement wavelengths. On top of the wavelength flexibility, the increased wavelength switching speed enables the use of asymmetry robust recipes by combining multiple wavelength measurements at each overlay target.\nIn this paper we will introduce a method to select the most accurate multi-wavelength recipe that provides significant improvement in accuracy compared to the best single wavelength recipe. We will introduce KPIs to monitor the health of the multi-wavelength measurement. The KPIs are reported per site indicating the accuracy for every measured point.\nAdditionally we will show our steps towards the recovery of the points flagged by multi-wavelength KPI by a combination of measuring more wavelengths and an accuracy guided region of interest selection.", "Overlay is one of the most critical design parameters in integrated circuit manufacturing. Maintaining good overlay performance during manufacturing is therefore essential in order to obtain high yield and to ensure that the performance and reliability of the eventual semiconductor device is according to specifications. For that reason, optical metrology is nowadays extensively used in any production facility for overlay monitoring and process control. Overlay metrology is typically required after each lithography step for (nearly) every lot. The number of process and lithograpy steps have increased significantly with advancing technology nodes and consequently there is an increased demand for overlay metrology. Although the benefits of overlay metrology are obvious, the use of metrology should be kept at acceptable levels as it adds cost and increases fab cycle time. Virtual overlay metrology, the replacement of some real overlay measurements with predicted values, is an effective solution for keeping the need for overlay metrology under control.", "One of the contributors to layer-to-layer overlay in today\u2019s chip manufacturing process is wafer distortion due to thin film deposition. Mismatch in the film specific material parameters (e.g., thermal expansion coefficients) may result in process-induced warpage of the wafers at room temperature. When these warped wafers are loaded onto the scanner for the next layer exposure, in-plane distortion patterns may be apparent after clamping. The wafer alignment system inside the scanner is designed to correct for these process-induced in-plane wafer distortion signatures. Depending on the complexity of the distortion pattern, the choice of wafer alignment model can be adapted to achieve the required overlay performance. While wafer overlay metrology is used to correct for the systematic part of the wafer distortion, the wafer alignment functionality addresses the random part that is varying from wafer-to-wafer.\nIn the case of a homogeneous single film of uniform stress deposited on a substrate at elevated temperatures inside a deposition tool, the resulting free-form wafer shape at room temperature will take a parabolic form (either bowl or umbrella). The resulting in-plane distortion can be described by a radial scaling pattern. A linear wafer alignment model can easily correct for these kinds of distortion patterns and the resulting overlay is close to the scanner baseline performance. Also, in the case where there is a slight variation in one of the material parameters across the wafer, the resulting wafer distortion can easily be corrected for by selecting one of the available wafer alignment models. A Higher Order Wafer Alignment model up to the third order (HOWA3) has been proven to be sufficient to bring the overlay performance down to the scanner baseline performance over the past years.\nIn this paper we will consider the impact of local stress variations on the global wafer deformation. One of the sources of the local stress variation is linked to the intra-field or intra-die pattern density. We will demonstrate that the intra-field stress distribution not only affects the intra-field overlay performance but has also a significant impact on the global wafer distortion. The focus will be mainly on use-cases with high intra-field stress variations similar to what is encountered in 3D-NAND processes. These cases in particular need a more advanced correction approach. However, since the underlying root cause is generic, the same approach may also be applicable to other use-cases like DRAM and Logic.", "In the past few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a subject of intense media hype. Machine learning, deep learning (DL), and AI come up in countless articles, often outside of technology-minded publications. As the AI hype keeps growing, it is important to be able to recognize the signal in the noise, to tell apart world-changing developments from what are merely over-hyped press releases. This paper tries to explain how deep learning is working and how GPU (Graphic Processing Unite) can make it a reality. Finally, in-memory computing (IMC) for DL is introduced to point out future high performance and low power DL hardware development direction.", "Introduction and problem statement Given that EUV lithography allows printing smaller Critical Dimension (CD) features, it can result in non-normal distributed CD populations on ADI wafers [Civay SPIE AL 2014], leading to errors in predicted failure rates [Bristol SPIE AL 2017]. As a result, there is a need to quantify the actual behavior of the CD population extremes by means of massive metrology [Dillen EUVL 2018]. Not only allows this to study the CD distribution, we can in parallel also evaluate pattern quality and the failure mechanisms leading to defects. This massive metrology method provides an accurate failure rate based on CD, and enables new possibilities to define a failure rate based on different metrics in a single measurement. Method We analyze the CD uniformity of pillars in polar coordinates using a global waveform based thresholding strategy. In conjunction with this CD information, we also evaluated the print quality of each individual measured feature. Fig 1. In line detected anomalies and failure definitions As we gather this information during the measurement of CD, we can limit the additional measurement overhead to neglectable levels. Application and outlook We will show how we can leverage this to determine a defect based process window and relations of failure mechanisms through process conditions (see figure 2). When we take failures in a CH dataset into account, we illustrate the effect on the shape of a large dataset distribution in figure 3. Fig 2. Defect identification for a through exposure dose experiment of pillars. For each condition >13k pillars where measured. The plot clearly shows an asymmetric behavior due to different failure mechanisms at low and high energy. The 2 vertical lines at relative energies 0.93 and 1.05 times nominal indicate the low defect process window. Fig 3. A distribution of measured regular grid dense CH. The red line is the unfiltered CD data, the blue line is the shape of the distribution after filtering individual CH measurements that have a much lower contrast than expected.", "Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) modeling has evolved throughout the years to address 2D edge placement corrections, driven mainly out of CDSEM measurement results. 3D pattern modeling, and 3D-OPC for resist pattern, is much more complex. 3D information can be obtained by Optical CD tools for large repetitive arrays, where the outcome is an averaged 3D profile, or by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), offering accurate local in-die 3D metrology but can be limited by tip size and can also involve long scan times. In recent years we have presented a 3DSEM imaging methodology using multiple detectors to reconstruct surface morphology. To address the 3D-OPC model characterization challenge we combine in this work two metrology methods; AFM as a reference tool, and 3DSEM. Both metrology techniques provide nondestructive, large statistical sample measurements, across the wafer for lithography process window characterization, and 3D-OPC model calibration. Parameterized test patterns were generated on mask by Synopsys and printed on wafers at IMEC. Selective patterns were measured by 3DSEM and AFM to optimize 3DSEM measurements. Statistically significant 3DSEM measurement results were used for 3D-OPC model calibration, offering 3D-OPC corrections including resist shrink induced by SEM imaging.", "In semiconductor fabs, electron microscopes are key equipment for metrology, failure analysis, physical characterization and defect review classification. In a wafer fab like ST Crolles 300mm, CDSEMs are generating more than 20 Million of images per year. The image is by itself a raw material on which the metrology is performed. It is needed to get access to CD which is very often a single value extracted. If the CD is in specification, it is very unlikely that someone will look at the picture. If someone would do so in a systematic way, it would see that there is much more information available in the image than a single CD value. Unfortunately, most of this information passes under the radar of SPC charts and is somehow wasted.\nThis paper presents results obtained by CDSEM image contour analysis from various kind of technologies and applications in manufacturing in our fab. These results show that images contain significant amounts of information that can be extracted and analyzed using an efficient contour extraction and analysis toolbox.\nProcess variability of complex shapes can be shown, robust layer to layer metrics can be computed, pattern shifting, shape changes, image quality and many others too. This opens new possibilities for process control and process variability monitoring and mitigation.", "With the Area Selective Deposition (ASD) technique, the material is deposited on desired areas of the sample surface. The control of such process implies accurate characterization of the deposited material on both growth and non-growth surfaces. This requires, first a good measurement capability to quantify the geometry of the deposited layer, and second, a proper assessment of the process selectivity. In this work, we show how to combine two complementary measurement techniques to overcome their individual inherent limitations1 for ASD applications. Scatterometry, the first measurement technique, has been applied to the characterization of the deposited layer geometry properties because of its high sensitivity to dimensional features and material. To complement the ASD performance characterization with the local information, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has been used to access the topography details of the analyzed surfaces. We have analyzed the AFM images with the power spectral density (PSD) approach to identify undesired material deposition in the non-growth area and thus to characterize process selectivity through the comparison to a reference sample. Experimental validation of the scatterometry and AFM techniques for ASD applications has been done on wafers having various selectivity levels. The scatterometry metrology measured accurately the thickness of the deposited layer on both growth and non-growth areas when the deposited layer became uniform. The lateral overgrowth was quantified as well with the same technique and showed some changes from process condition to another. In addition, the PSD analysis applied to the AFM images was able to probe minutely the nanoparticles nucleation on the non-growth area and as result has revealed the selectivity transition regimes. Later, we have built a hybrid model by the combination of the 2 metrologies results and validated its predictions on test wafers.", "Power Spectral Density (PSD) is now a standard analysis for pattern roughness process control in advanced patterning. Due to PSD analysis sensitivity coupled with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) are more understood. However, this is applied on sides of the line, and has limited information about roughness on top of the pattern. On the other hand, Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measure accurately the topography of pattern and even if this metrology is probe size dependent, the top of the patterned lines is well revealed when trenches are too narrow to be measured. In this work, we have adapted and applied the PSD analysis on patterned lines measured by AFM. Specific algorithm has been developed to localize the analysis on top of the line. This allow us to report on the effect of processes, such EUV resist smoothening and Area Selective Deposition (ASD).", "To reduce defocus from leveling errors at the wafer edge, modern exposure tools offer a broad range of advanced leveling controls. These can be explored fully with minimum experimental effort by simulating alternative set-point curves (z; Rx; Ry) and resulting MA and MSD focus residuals from existing full wafer height maps. In this paper, optimizations are carried out to obtain the best focus edge clearance settings for several DRAM and NAND products, across different layers and exposure tools. The simulated die-fine focus errors are compared to the POR settings and verified with electrical results. Differences across products, layers, and exposure tools are discussed.", "Since the beginning of the Crolles 300mm fab, more and more complex logic technologies, down to 28nm node, have been developed. At the same time, the products mix increased at a very high level : Specifically for the lithography area, this complexity leads to an intricate management of thousands of masks, hundreds of track process recipes, used on various lithography clusters types (193nm including immersion, 248nm and 365nm). In order to apply the best process parameters, APC software is used since many years, and was continuously improved. It now takes into account multi-variate parameters coming from various process contexts. A new sampling tool was developed to adjust the measurements control plan. All kind of in-line measures are addressed (thickness, critical dimensions, overlay\u2026). Since the beginning of this software development, the approach was to keep in mind the APC model. The objective was to use the APC data\u2019s (alarms and warnings) to secure the sampling decisions without compromising the regulation loops stability.\nThis sampling tool can use different inputs (production, tools, APC\u2026) in a dynamic way. This means that the system is dynamic for both process and metrology aspects, and can be adapted to integrate different variables and external events. A real time communication flow was created between APC and sampling tool. Even if the measurement skip decision is taken by the sampling tool, the APC feedback is systematically requested when run to run is involved, like for all lithography process steps. The strength is to deal with high products / mix complexity and react in real time to new product introduction, process deviation, atypical lots including R&D projects and sudden change of the products mix. Both tools are so linked that the sampler remains invisible. Process engineers continue to manage and control lithography process through APC tool mainly.\nIn parallel, different alarms and triggers have been implemented, including a specific \u201ccrisis\u201d mode to quickly respond to the metrology equipment loading or availability variability.\nThe sampler introduction allowed an optimization of the metrology toolset costs and lot cycle time improvement. Also as a consequence, a more efficient metrology control plan, with an optimized balance between process criticality and metrology requirements.\nFuture opportunities are related to more dynamic behaviors, as a dynamic sampling rate adapted to metrology capacity, function of the real time metrology capacity or sampling decision dynamically based on process variability components.", "EUV lithography has been adopted in most advanced semiconductor manufacture fabs, enabling the next step in design rule scaling. With this progress, minimum critical defect size has become smaller and harder to detect. Defect inspection equipment suppliers must therefore in parallel provide a significant step up in inspection sensitivity at a reasonable throughput. Optical inspection tools are facing an unprecedented challenge because defects less than 10nm are not optically visible. As an alternative, semiconductor manufacturers have turned toward e-beam inspection. E-beam inspection is widely used in R&D to shorten development cycle-time and selectively used in high volume manufacturing (HVM) for process monitoring, however currently it is not fast enough for large-scale replacement of optical inspection. Our approach to address this shortcoming is to combine cutting edge multiple-beam technology with a cutting edge positioning system/computation architecture to create a next generation e-beam inspection system capable of scanning with multiple electron beams at the same time. This paper reports on the progress in developing such a system as well as future multi-beam inspection applications.", "Stochastic effects in EUV patterning refer to random variations that impact local pattern edge fidelity. It can be caused by the lithography or etch processes. Distorted edge placement can result in larger pattern edge roughness, distorted pattern shape for contract holes, poor CD uniformity, and in more severe cases, partially or fully closed contacts. Large statistical SEM metrology can be used to quantify the severity of distortion and failure probability by measuring line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) [3].\nThe attempt to differentiate between normal global uniformity and local uniformity pose a metrology challenge. In this paper, we present a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based method for detecting stochastic defects. The detected defects are reviewed by metrology and classified by defect margin merit. The proposed merit converts geometrical attributes into statistical attributes which identify whether a pattern is statistically normal or a statistical outlier.", "Voltage contrast (VC) is a long known and well established technique to give combined inline sensitivity to electrically relevant measures of defectivity but also local defect isolation and integrated review SEM making the technique a critical piece of fab wafer inspection. By creation of a special mark design with many local repeats of different CD and overlay set points a voltage contrast response is created which allows the local edge placement error population to be estimated while also capturing a connectivity and isolation yield proxy. This enables high throughput local estimates of overlay, CD, overlay and CD process window and local CD uniformity. A test mask containing these marks was designed and fabricated at IMEC with metrology done on optical and electron beam inspection systems. Both open and short sensitivity are programmed into the marks and this yield proxy data has inherent value on its own. We propose to integrate these special test marks into some critical layers in modern memory and logic process flows with a design which can be added to scribe lines or empty regions/in die test structures in logic or empty regions of the memory periphery. Significant design and process knowledge is required to design a mark which can integrate with the process and give good EPE sensitivity. Initial mark designs have been targeted at single damascene copper on tungsten with VC inspection after copper polish. Initial results show a high baseline yield loss but also show clear and intuitive CD and Overlay process window quantification from the VC EPE marks. Marks as large as ~100,000 um2 and as small at 250um2 have been designed and enable overlay, CD, LCDU and with yield sensitivity to ~1 part per million for the larger marks and ~1% for the smallest marks. With the expected productivity of the ebeam inspection system we should be able thousands of marks per wafer or field to support diverse overlay, CD and control use models and process fingerprint mapping.", "With the adoption of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography in high volume manufacturing (HVM) to enable the sub-7nm scaling roadmap, defect characterization brings new challenges and learnings. Traditional approaches to process window discovery (PWD) methodology developed2,3,4 using broadband plasma optical inspection also hold in the realm of EUV lithography. Although there is substantial depth of focus for regular patterns, focus continues to be an important modulation parameter for logic patterns. Dose is an important modulation parameter especially due to stochastic defects.1 Further, overlay is another important parameter when it comes to hybrid integration schemes such as self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) and EUV block patterning, for example, in BEOL layers. In this paper, we will discuss PWD results on a foundry N5 equivalent M2 layer, studying both SAQP and block integration with direct EUV patterning. We also demonstrate the impact of EUV stochastics to the overall process window and develop useful analysis methodologies.", "The authors report on critical dimension metrology on nanoscale gratings by means of laboratory-based spectroscopic reflectometry in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). EUV reflectivity spectra of nanoscale gratings under grazing incidence illumination and their dependency on the geometrical grating parameters are discussed. A laboratory-based setup to measure such spectra is introduced and its main features are presented. A nanoscale grating with a grating period below 100 nm, consisting of multiple nanometer-size layers of materials, is experimentally investigated in the setup. The experimental results are consequently compared to a rigorous model fit of the reflectivity and thus the ability to model the grating\u2019s interaction with EUV radiation is shown.", "In recent years, miniaturization and multilayering have been key technologies in order to improve performance and integration of semiconductor devices. For a fine dimension control of semiconductor devices, the critical-dimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) has been widely used. In addition to this technique, the recent advent of 3D semiconductor devices has created a strong demand for new dimension control method. We have developed a scanning ion microscope with a gas field ion source (GFIS-SIM) to meet this demand. The GFIS has almost the same brightness as a field emission type electron source, and it is possible to switch from a light-element ion used for observation to a heavy-element ion used for processing. In this way, we can achieve a high degree of freedom in the sample chamber (regarding sample size and inclination), an observation resolution of better than 1 nm, and the sample processing function with one identical ion source and beam column. We succeeded in observing the internal structure of several samples using this technique. We dug each sample with 2 kV neon ions to expose the internal structure, switched the ion beam, and successfully observed its internal structure with a hydrogen ion beam of 30 kV.", "Microscopically, a rough edge can be considered as a set of exclusions (i.e., bumps) and inclusions (i.e., divots) along a sidewall. These local perturbations along the sidewall can be thought of as the most basic building blocks of the geometry of rough edges. However, these two structural geometries image differently under critical dimension scanning electron microscopes (CD-SEM), and also when scanned from different directions. An understanding of these imaging differences should be important to improving roughness measurement accuracy. In this work, images from using Monte Carlo and analytical simulations of different sizes of exclusions and inclusions on flat edges are used to better understand the effects of the local microgeometry of the edge, and also how various SEM algorithm choices, parameters, beam size/shape, charging, scan direction, and pixel size/scanning scheme influence SEM line edge uncertainties for such features. Furthermore, how these errors interact with roughness power spectral density (PSD) metrics will be explored, imparting knowledge for optimizing roughness PSD measurement with minimized error.", "Deep Learning (DL) techniques based on Denoising Convolutional Neural Networks (DeCNN) are applied in the denoising of SEM images of line patterns to contribute to noise-reduced (unbiased) LER nanometrology. The models of DeCNN are trained in a sufficiently large set of synthesized SEM images with controlled Gaussian and Poisson noise level. Due to the image-based nature of the DL approach, it can be combined sequentially with the state of the art PSD-based method especially for highly noisy images where the use of the PSD-based method alone fails. The results for test synthesized images show the high predicting capability of the DL assisted method for the commonly used LER parameters and functions (Rms, \u03be, \u03b1, PSD) of the true (zero-noise) values revealing its potential for future use toward an unbiased LER metrology.", "The use of large numerical apertures in spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE) or reflectometer (SR) designs allows for smaller measurement targets, but it may introduce side effects like the propagation of high diffraction orders into the collection pupil. In the normal optical critical dimension (CD) measurement condition, the zeroth-order diffracted light is the only light illuminating the pupil. However, when the pitch of the measurement target is large enough, the high-order diffracted light can also enter the pupil and mix with the zeroth-order diffracted light. This contaminates the measurement and leads to inaccuracies in fitting the target's model to the data.\nIn this paper, we propose a method that retains good measurement results even when the collected spectrum includes contamination due to high-order diffraction. In this approach, we treat the high-order diffracted light contamination as the primary source of error in the measurement. We modify the maximum likelihood estimation using one of three different additional weighting schemes that lead to optimal measurement results. In general, we have found that not all the wavelengths in the affected wavelength zone have the same contamination impact\n. The above concept was validated using a synthetic and an actual large pitch CD measurement, successfully demonstrating that the proposed method virtually eliminates the inaccuracy. These results show that this method effectively allows the user to use the full wavelength range of interest from 190-800nm, in spite of the fact that a significant fraction of this wavelength range includes the presence of higher diffraction orders. This method thus allows for accurate measurements of large pitch SRAM targets and enables yield improvement for N5 and newer logic devices.", "We have been integrating an automatic aberration correction system, capable of chromatic and spherical aberration correction, to an SEM platform. Performance in CD metrology and inspection are being evaluated at ultra-low landing energy conditions down to 100 eV. The improvement in image sharpness was proved with Au particle samples. Furthermore, the surface sensitivity and image sharpness, during SEM observation of devices consisting of light elements, were also improved. Both the bridge structures of the DSA fingerprint pattern, and the unevenness of the outmost surface of FinFET gates were clearly observed at landing energy of 150 eV. Besides, line-edge roughness and subtle residue at trench area of EUV resist L&S pattern was also clearly observed at landing energy of less than 100 eV, which indicates aberration-correction-technology integrated SEM is promising for both inspection and CD metrology in the EUV lithography era.", "In semiconductor industry, as physical sizes of integrated circuit (IC) components continue to shrink, critical dimension (CD) metrology plays an important role in manufacturing process monitor and control. However, when prior knowledge of E-beam tool conditions and statistics of underlying imaging samples are limited or missing, metrology parameters (such as imaging conditions and CD measurement parameters) are often selected empirically and not optimized in terms of measurement accuracy or precision. Common practice involved in fine-tuning some of the parameters may result in a time-consuming trial-and-error cycle.\nIn this paper, we propose a guidance system to provide an optimized set of metrology parameters given a line/space pattern image or images of scanning electron microscope (SEM). The proposed system models input condition with a comprehensive set of model parameters and then statistical analysis is done based on modeling outputs. A set of metrology guidelines, such as measurement parameters and achievable precisions, can be recommended by the proposed system. The validity of our method has been demonstrated by comparing the recommended parameters with the optimal parameters found by brute-force search on a set of 100 SEM images of line/space patterns.", "Metrology of 3D NAND device architecture is challenging due to structural complexity, low signal to noise and contrast to noise ratio in the electron micrographs. Efficient, automated tools that can measure critical dimensions of 3D NAND in electron micrographs can be a part of solution for process monitoring, uniformity control and structural modelling through OCD, CD-SEM, e-beam tech., etc. In this paper we present an automated technique based on a snake algorithm in a multi-stage, scale-space framework to delineate continuous interfaces between different materials/layers of 3D NAND cells. The snake algorithm takes an initial contour and forces the initial contours to move and deform towards the interface between different material layers using an iterative energy minimization process while preserving the continuity and smoothness of the contour. At the end of energy minimization, the interface between different materials such as central hole, core silicon oxide, poly silicon, tunneling silicon oxide, silicon nitride with storage function, blocking silicon oxide, outer metal layers, etc., are delineated and marked by labelled contours. Prior knowledge, if available, about the number of material-layers and approximate distance between them can be used to improve the efficiency of the process. The proposed method transforms the micrograph into a digital metrology image where critical dimensions such as thickness of the materials, shape of the material layers, etc., can be automatically measured. The additional information provided by continuous contours can be used with \u2018Big Data\u2019 analytics to uncover patterns, variations, and outliers that may go unnoticed in discrete measurement data.", "We propose a novel combined measurement system for measuring surface and thickness profiles of multi-layered film specimens named as MYFIELM (Measurement sYstem of Film structure by Interferometry and ELlipsoMetry). Film thickness profiles measured by ellipsometry mode are transferred to interferometry mode in MYFIELM and the surface profile can be extracted from the spectral phase of the interferometry containing both of surface height and film thicknesses. For the verification, each performance of the operating mode was confirmed and 4 film layered specimen was measured in comparison of the reference values. To the best of our knowledge, MYFIELM is the most suitable solution for characterizing thin film structures with a textured substrate without any damage on the specimen compared with the previous techniques even though it needs further improvements for stability and reliability.", "As semiconductor technology nodes keep shrinking, ever-tightening on-product overlay (OPO) budgets coupled with continuous process development and improvement make it critical to have a robust and accurate metrology setup. Process monitoring and control is becoming increasingly important to achieve high yield production. In recently introduced advanced overlay (OVL) systems, a supercontinuum laser source is applied to facilitate the collection of overlay spectra to increase measurement stability. In this paper, an analysis methodology has been proposed to couple the measured overlay spectra with overlay simulation to extract exact process information from overlay spectra. This paper demonstrates the ability to use overlay spectra to capture and quantify process variation, which in turn can be used to calibrate the simulation stacks used to create the SCOL (scatterometry-based overlay) and AIM overlay metrology targets, and can be fed into the fab for process monitoring and improvement.", "Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a capable to provide high resolution CD-metrology and precise defects analysis on large wafers, masks or displays. However, AFM is not enough productive for high-throughput industrial uses. Standard single probe AFMs are showing low throughput as a serial imaging tools. The use of an array of four cantilevers as a Quattro-Array results in effective speed of 6 to 10 mm/s. An image size of 0.5mm x 0.2mm is achieved employing a piezoelectric positioner with a scan range of 200\u03bcm x 200\u03bcm and a resolution of 0.25nm (x,y) and 0.2nm (z), respectively. These capabilities are qualifying the Quattro-cantilever array system as fastest tool for.

Many investigations have been done to inspect defects on silicon wafer. However, rare studies have been reported on defect components inspection which is also critical to trace to the source of defects and monitor the manufacture processes in time. In order to inspect the components of contaminated particles on silicon wafer, especially with a high speed and in line mode, dual nanosecond pulse laser system both wavelengths at 532nm is designed in which one laser pumps the particles away from wafer surface almost without damage, the other laser breakdowns the particles in air above the wafer surface to obtain the emission lines of the contaminated particles by a spectroscopy with CCD. The sensitivity of the dual pulse laser system is evaluated.", "Line edge roughness (LER) measurement is one of the metrology challenges for 3D device structures, and LER reference metrology is important for reliable LER measurements. We developed an LER measurement technique, which is able to analyze LER distribution along height of a line pattern, with high accuracy, resolution, and reproducibility. Highly accurate atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of a vertical sidewall of a line pattern was obtained using a metrological tilting- AFM, which offers SI-traceable dimensional measurements. The tilting-tip was controlled with an inclined servo axis and scans the vertical sidewall along a line pattern with a high sampling density to enable an analysis of the LER height distribution at the sidewall. A horizontal cross-section of the sidewall shows sidewall roughness with sub-nm resolution. Power spectral density (PSD) analysis of the sidewall profile showed that the PSD noise in the high-frequency region was several orders of magnitude lower than the noise of typical scanning electron microscopy methods. AFM measurements were sequentially repeated three times to evaluate the reproducibility of the sidewall measurement and LER analysis; results indicated a high reproducibility of 0.07 nm evaluated as a standard deviation of LER at each height.", "Industry standard yield models make no provision for the heterogeneity of defect density or indication of how the uncertainty of defect density is propagated to uncertainty of die per wafer yield. In this paper we show how standard models can be extended by causal analysis to improve their generality. Causal diagrams are employed to specify yield models and make their assumptions transparent. Worked examples are provided as well as all the open-source code needed for the analyses.", "TNO is developing a novel Large Dynamic Range Atomic Force Microscope (LDR-AFM), primarily but not exclusively designed for sub-nm accurate overlay metrology. The LDR-AFM combines an AFM with a 6 degrees- of-freedom interferometric positioning stage, thereby enabling measurements of sub-nm features on a wafer over multiple millimeters marker-to-feature distances. The current work provides an overview of recent developments and presents the first results obtained after final integration of the complete system. This includes results on the AFM head development, the validated positioning stage performance, the first AFM images, and long-term stability measurements.", "In the leading-edge production measuring the geometrical dimensions with e-beam inspection (CD-SEM data) or scatterometry technology (OCD data) is one of the most time-consuming steps without adding value to the wafer. Hence the fabs want to limit the effort to minimize the costs per wafer. On the other hand, the output of the metrology steps is needed to feed the SPC and APC systems with sufficient information. We handle that trade-off with a new sampling scheme optimizer supporting CD-SEM and OCD data.\nGenerally, we can use the sampling scheme optimization for a set of different features and their measured parameters in parallel. Especially in logic, but also for memory, the focus and dose dependencies of several features may be different. Hence, we optimized the distribution of the measured sites to create a perfect representation of the systematic fingerprint for all important anchor features within one single sampling scheme.\nFor the verification of the approach we investigated two cases. The first case are dense CD measurements, which are usually needed to create and update intra-field dose corrections. We minimize the number of measured sites significantly and distribute the remaining sites over different fields to ensure a good coverage of the systematic effects. Finally, that allows us a much higher update frequency of the dose corrections and yields in smaller CDU values.\nThe second case optimized the throughput of an OCD metrology system. The applied high-density sampling scheme for the focus monitoring done on reference wafers takes a lot of time during measuring. That specific type of measurement is done for monitoring and updating the focus reference corrections. With our proposed solution, we can achieve the same quality with respect to the reference measurement with more 50% less measured sites.", "With the miniaturization of devices, hot spot evaluation of a wide area of a wafer for small change points such as wafer topology is required. DBM (Design Based Metrology) is an effective method for evaluating systematic defects of multiple patterning and EUV lithography. However, it takes a long time to evaluate because it is necessary to acquire a high-SN SEM image captured by low-speed SEM scanning conditions. Therefore, we developed a new pattern matching method of DBM by utilizing deep learning technology. Our proposed method can handle low-SN SEM images captured under high-speed SEM scanning conditions.\nIn the proposed method, we use deep learning to estimate design layout from SEM image, and then perform pattern matching between this estimated design layout and the true design layout. The proposed method is particularly effective for pattern matching of low-SN SEM images and circuit pattern distorted during manufacturing process. It is expected that this method will be advantageous for evaluating mass systematic defects during the process development. Experimental results showed that the proposed method could estimate the design layout from the low-SN SEM image and improve the pattern matching success rate.", "To realize higher resolution in optical inspection systems is typically using shorter wavelengths including UV light and a higher NA of the objective lens. Extreme performances of illumination and imaging systems in well-matched situations are inevitable with further effort put on the development of an effective optical system for inspecting microscopic defects on patterned wafers.\nFor this study, we focus on the dark-field illumination system for index-matched near-field microscope using an aplanatic solid immersion lens (A-SIL). We present dark-field illumination that has illumination channels on the side of the A-SIL to overcome the issue of deficient space. The table-top experiments are conducted to show a feasibility of a dark-field imaging method for the near-field condition before verifying the performance of the optical system.", "The introduction of advanced technology nodes in deep UV (DUV) lithography (litho), involving multiple litho steps, has tightened the wafer on-product overlay specifications [1]. The industry trend already pushes the overlay requirements to the sub-nanometer regime (and so the mask registration requirements tightens as well). In the most general view, wafer on-product overlay errors are a combination of intra-field (within field) and inter-field (field-to-field) errors. A given litho layer intra-field overlay error includes several systematic sources, such as scanner lens-to-lens residuals and mask writer residuals. Parallel to the nodes and litho techniques advancing, the ability to accurately measure overlay at high lateral resolution have being successfully introduced, both at wafer and mask side.\nThe recent developments in scanner technology improved the ability to control intra-field overlay at high-order across the exposure field. However, this is still in several millimeter lateral resolution control ability at its best, leaving residual errors in the sub-millimeter to few millimeter regime without the ability to further suppress them to the target specification, nevertheless, not to the sub-nanometer magnitude.\nIn this work, we have empirically evaluated the ZEISS state-of-the-art mask tuning solution named ForTune ERC (Enhanced Registration Control). This solution is based on laser processing of the mask bulk by the ZEISS ForTune tool. It allows to suppress few nanometer overlay residuals (post the scanner best-can-do) down to deep sub-nanometer, all even at sub-millimeter sampling resolution (x1 wafer level) and low-to-high residuals modulating frequency.\nFor the sake of this study, we have used a dual-image mask to form one overlay signature at wafer side. Two wafers have been exposed prior to the laser-based tuning of the mask bulk; the wafers overlay error was measured and used as an initial overlay problem to begin with. A second exposure of two additional wafers was performed post the problem-solving by the ERC model and the consequent mask laser-based tuning. The pre/post wafers were then compared to examine the improvement in overlay at wafer side. CD uniformity (CDU) data has been collected as well, to confirm no degradation in CDU due to the ForTune ERC process.\nThe combination of this advanced method of intra-field control with high-order correction per exposure (CPE) by the scanner, provides an efficient co-optimized solution to tightly control the overlay of existing and future nodes at DUV litho.", "Metrology and inspection (MI) processes are established at critical points of the semiconductor manufacturing process in order to maintain a certain yield and also provide information needed for future processes improvements. Typically, the inspection consists of dark-field (DF) inspection and SEM review/classification processes. An optical DF microscopy system (or inspection tool) first detects particles or pattern defects on wafers and obtains their position coordinates. However, due to its limited optical resolution, the DF system is not widely applied in the review process, which requires higher resolution images of the detected defects such as those provided by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) but with a sacrifice of throughput. We propose an innovative idea of applying two (or three) dark-field microscopy images for intermediate defect classification and size estimation under optical resolution. The proposed method utilizes the angular scattering distribution from a defect that is in the Mie scattering domain, which varies depending on both the beam and defect properties (wavelength, polarization, incident angle; shape, size, complex refractive index). It captures three darkfield images of the same wafer by three inter-changeable objectives with different magnification and numerical aperture (NA) values under identical side illumination conditions. We estimate the defect types and sizes simply by investing three measurements. We demonstrated this proposed method to classify and estimate the defect size down to ~ 80nm by an existing UV inspection tool with three DF imaging modes; 1) M15 mode, sampling stance = 150 nm, NA =0.6, 2) M25 mode, sampling distance = 250 nm, NA=0.36, and 3) M40 mode, sampling distance =400 nm, and NA =0.23. We demonstrated its feasibility by an independent SEM measurement of the detected defects.", "To produce high-yielding wafers, overlay control in DRAM production needs to be exceptionally tight. The ASML YieldStar 375F introduces a continuous wavelength source and dual wavelength operation to deliver the high measurement accuracy and robustness required as input to the overlay control loop. At the same time, the high throughput required to allow high sampling densities is maintained. The YieldStar 375 was evaluated and adopted for Samsung\u2019s D1y DRAM node.", "It is important to remove image noise properly to measure critical dimension (CD) and roughness values from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. In order to reduce image noise, the number of electron beam (EB) scans, or frame number, is increased. However, this excess EB irradiation damages the objects being measured and changes their size. In this paper, a new image analysis method is introduced to remove image noise without a typical noise filter. In this method, each image frame is used in a four dimensional array, and several artificial images are generated and edge coordinates are calculated. As a result of this new method, we can separate the line width roughness (LWR) components into process roughness and image noise, and analyze images with lower number of frames with minimal EB damage.\nThe impact of image noise on the accuracy of CD extraction is explained in the section on analysis of variance (ANOVA). The variation is separated as wafer to wafer (WTW), field to field (FTF), die to die (DTD), pattern to pattern (PTP), line width roughness (LWR), and stochastic pattern noise (SPN; which is random variation per a pattern) at this ANOVA. Roughness component from image noise is included in SPN. It is possible to remove the image noise component from SPN by applying this new image analysis method, and it is also possible to discuss the SPN from shot noise of exposure tool or variation of resist material component. ANOVA can put an end to discussion of measurement length of line pattern to know the state of low frequency roughness. LWR component of long wavelength is distributed to PTP and SPN when short patterns are measured. It is important to remove image nose properly and to compare the statistical analysis processed SPN value.", "There are different approaches for alignment sampling optimization. In order to determine, which approach is optimal, OPAL run-to-run simulations1 must be executed using the result of the different sampling optimization. This means that there is a two-step approach: first, an iterative sampling optimization algorithm that results in optimal overlay modeling. Then, a run-to-run simulation is done to verify the impact on the overlay performance.\nIn this study, we investigate on the behavior of four different approaches to alignment sampling optimization on four different layers and analyze which approach is most suitable for which layer.", "In leading edge lithography, overlay is usually controlled by feedback based on measurements on overlay targets, which are located between the dies. These measurements are done directly after developing the wafer. However, it is well-known that the measurement on the overlay marks does not always represent the actual device overlay correctly. This can be due to different factors, including mask writing errors, target-to-device differences and non-litho processing effects, for instance by the etch process.1\nIn order to verify these differences, overlay measurements are regularly done after the final etch process. These post-etch overlay measurements can be performed by using the same overlay targets used in post-litho overlay measurement or other targets. Alternatively, they can be in-device measurements using electron beam measurement tools (for instance CD-SEM). The difference is calculated between the standard post-litho measurement and the post-etch measurement. The calculation result is known as litho-etch overlay bias.\nThis study focuses on the feasibility of post-etch overlay measurement run-to-run (R2R) feedback instead of post-lithography R2R feedback correction. It is known that the post-litho processes have strong non-linear influences on the in-device overlay signature and, hence, on the final overlay budget. A post-etch based R2R correction is able to mitigate such influences.2\nThis paper addresses several questions and challenges related to post-etch overlay measurement with respect to R2R feedback control. The behavior of the overlay targets in the scribe-line is compared to the overlay behavior of device structures. The influence of different measurement methodologies (optical image-based overlay vs. electron microscope overlay measurement) was evaluated. Scribe-line standard overlay targets will be measured with electron microscope measurement. In addition, the influence of the intra-field location of the targets on device-to-target shifts was evaluated.", "Every nanometer of residual nano-topography (with high spatial frequency fingerprint) that the scanner cannot correct during the wafer exposure directly propagates into the focus budget [1].\nProcess windows are getting tight with a greater and greater contribution of the focus budget. Nanotopography is highly correlated to the chip layout. As a consequence it shows systematic peaks and valleys shifting locally optimum process conditions. Mean, standard deviations and ranges are not enough to characterize it.\nIt is of high importance to know topography maps to identify care areas on silicon with high risks of defocus situations [2]. These maps can be measured at any process step using PWG (Patterned Wafer Geometry) tools but could also be predicted with models (see proof of concept [3]).\nThe first part of this paper deals with the development of scripts to extract and express in multiples ways topography information. Different types of expressions will be shown followed by two use cases related to topography description situation: striation detection and slurry choice for CMP. Those two use cases are proofs of concepts showing that data valorization is a path to provide information that can help process engineers to make decisions and save time for defect detection.\nThis paper ends with a deeper exploration of the correlations between chip designs and nanotopography from an image processing point of view (design layout and wafer topography maps). Short-range and long-range contributions of layouts are used to model nano-topography through a multiple linear regression [4] of the pre-processed design layers densities (surface and perimeter) and wafer topography which is characterized in this work using KLA PWG tooling. The goal being here to predict wafer topography before silicon is being processed so that mitigation solutions can be set up.\nPWG metrology tool can measure a full wafer nano-topography map with pixels size of 100\u03bcm*100\u03bcm which is enough for a focus analysis. Results show that the first model version reaches encouraging figures of 0.77 R2 for a product layer having a 20nm topography range.", "The growing demand for advanced DRAM technologies requires development of novel process control methodologies reflecting design rule shrinkage. The new challenges for CD SEM metrology of dense feature arrays of DRAM layers are widely considered in the literature and ITRS documents. In addition to traditional SEM metrology methods based on measurement of individual features, the development of novel measurement techniques is required for dense cell arrays at small nodes.[1-3] We considered a novel metrology of CDSEM Critical Dimension (CD) in dense arrays, formed as capacitors in advanced dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) layers. The proposed approach is based on traditional CDSEM metrology methodology with new developments providing flexibility, CD-style high precision, and large statistical sampling capabilities for advanced Statistical Process Control (SPC). The metrology challenge is solved through development of new algorithmic approaches for dense array measurements. The approach was validated on data simulation of extracting geometry (CD) parameters of actual DRAM cell structures and verified on real data.", "It was proven that higher order intra-field alignment data modeling and correction has the potential to improve overlay performance by correcting reticle heating and lens heating effects intra-wafer and wafer- to-wafer.1 But there were also challenges shown that needed further investigation. As the alignment measurement is done on a coordinate system with absolute positions, the modeled iHOPC values might be high. A suitable method needs to be developed to distinguish between tool-to-tool offsets, process influence and layer-to-layer tool stack effect. In this paper we will take the next step and evaluate the overlay improvement potential by using intra-field alignment data in an overlay feed-forward simulation. An overlay run-to-run simulation is afterwards performed to estimate the optimization potential. To simulate higher order intra-field overlay, dense alignment data is needed. Facing the challenge of optimizing the number of measured marks but not losing relevant information, an intra-field alignment mark sampling optimization is done to find the best compromise between throughput and overlay accuracy.", "The uncertainty of measurements is an important element of the measurement result. The component part of the uncertainty budget is the sensitivity coefficients included in the measurement equation that are the ratio of change in measurands to the change in each of the parameters included in the measurement equation. The use of software in the systems for measurement and modeling of measuring processes allows to take into account and analyze all possible factors of influence on the result of measurements, carry out model research, reject factors with minimal impact and vice versa, analyze in more detail those with maximum impact on expanded uncertainty.\nThe study of the national measurement standards allows to carry out experimental programs on their improvement and increasing the level of metrological services. The analysis of the influence of additional input quantities complicates the model equation but leads to in-depth study of the physical process. Calculations are made using the finite element method implemented in the academic version of the software package of engineering analysis.\nThe purpose of the work is to study the influence of additional sensitivity coefficients included in the uncertainty budget of the measurement result. In the example of modeling of the hardness measurement on the Rockwell and Super- Rockwell scales, an approach to refine the model equation based on the inclusion of additional input quantities is considered.\nAs a practical application, the proposed methodology is useful in evaluating the results of international comparisons. As a promising area for further research, there is an in-depth study of additional sensitivity coefficients when drawing-up the uncertainty budget on the Vickers and Brinell scales.", "Each of six scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) system alignments were characterized with a sensitivity test to better understand the impact of the alignment on microscope automation for acquisition and metrology. The upper and lower limits of the alignment sensitivity combined with the accuracy of the automated system alignments are used to determine the process capability index (Cpk). The primary limiting factor for the alignment sensitivity was passing the metrology dynamic precision criteria of <0.3nm. Strong alignment offset showed impact on the autofunction robustness, but was marginal in comparison to the metrology sensitivity. All six of the STEM system alignments resulted in Cpk values greater than 1.3, supporting a three sigma quality process. Based on these results, criteria can be defined for alignment offset limits that will trigger automated preventative maintenance (APM) re-alignments and ensure that automated STEM metrology will meet the accuracy and precision requirements for adequate process control.", "As device size continues to shrink, stochastic-induced roughness of resist features exposed by photolithography is of increasing concern to the semiconductor industry. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for line roughness analysis by using the Line Roughness Module from our CDU solution family, which is a part of HMI\u2019s metrology SEM tool the eP5. Simulated Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of line/space patterns are used to verify the ability of the Module to reliably extract roughness related metrics. A set of imec EUV ADI images collected on our metrology SEM tool are analyzed by the Line Roughness Module, and wafer signature maps of various roughness metrics are obtained. These wafer maps not only help to analyze different roughness contribution sources, but also provide insights about feature roughness in a systematic way. Such information can be further used in a feedback loop to the scanner for model correction and process control.", "As well known that, the critical dimension continues to shrink and the overlay control appears to become much more challenging than before. In such situation, we are seeking for solutions to minimize the impact of measurement shift in overlay detection induced by process variations. When the accuracy of overlay measurement improved, corrections can be performed effectively according to the feedbacks from metrology results. We build a physical model for simulating overlay metrology employing diffraction based overlay (DBO) principles, which can help to conduct researches on DBO metrology in advanced semiconductor nodes.\nIn this paper, we present a physical model of the DBO metrology which based on the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. The basis and principles of model establishment was discussed. After adjusting the model parameters compatible with the actual measurement conditions, the metrology wavelengths which provide the best accuracy and robustness of DBO measurement can be selected through simulations. The results of our study will be demonstrated in this publication.", "The use of the finite element method in engineering calculations almost always brings some simplification in relation to the real object. Since the finite element method is a numerical method, the accuracy of the results obtained depends on the type, size and location of finite elements. In the general case, the use of models with a large mesh gives understated results. Reducing the size of an element provides the required refining of the calculation model and obtaining results that are more reliable. However, the use of finite elements of a higher order does not always lead to an increase in the accuracy of the results obtained, and in some cases, it is irrational.\nAn important element in the application of modern engineering software packages for solving metrological problems (modeling of measurement processes, calculations of the characteristics of components of the national measurement standards) is the reliability of the results obtained, the adjustment of the results obtained with the results got by analytical calculation with the use of classical equations (the explicit solution).\nThe purpose of the work is to confirm the reliability of calculations of finite element modeling in the study of the distribution of temperature field through the composition panel. Calculations are made using the academic version of the software package of engineering analysis and by the classical matrix algebra method for solving temperature problems. Based on the obtained results, conclusions are made regarding the reliability of finite element modeling data.", "In this paper we propose the implementation of a machine learning technique based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to provide denoising of line edges and unbiased LER measurement. HMMs are widely used with great success in speech recognition and image processing for denoising and filtering noise. Here HMMs are used for similar purposes, working with the observed (noisy) edge data, acquired through SEM imaging and an edge detection algorithm in an effort to retrieve a parent edge signal that is statistically close to the real one.\nThe developed HMM method was trained with the assistance of synthesized rough edges, on a wide spectrum of predefined and controlled noise levels and roughness characteristics. This ensures the method adapts on a variety of LER parameters and noise levels. The edges were then used to validate its effectiveness in a broad range of line patterns. Our results so far specify the characteristics of the training data set which are required to make the method effective in the unbiased LER measurement.", "As technology nodes advance, the need for higher sensitivity optical inspection to identify critical defects has become extremely important for technology development. However, more sensitive optical inspection can induce more nuisance and hence more SEM non-visual (SNV) defects during review sampling. High SNV in the defect Pareto hinders the ability to get a true picture of the actual distribution of defect types on a wafer, and defect-of-interest (DOI) types that are crucial for process diagnostics can be missed. The culprit of this problem is the method of review sampling.\nTraditional review sampling consists of two parts: binning and defect selection. Binning is defined as a set of rules and conditions determined by human experience and judgment to categorize different DOI types. Then, defects are selected from each bin and reviewed by SEM. Due to the nature of high SNV from optical inspection, the random selection of defects will end up with high SNV in the defect Pareto. A defect Pareto with high SNV provides little value to yield learning. Because SEM review plus classification is limited by time and economic budget, improving the ability to predict whether a defect is DOI or SNV before SEM review is valuable.\nThis paper introduces a machine learning based method suitable for high volume manufacturing that can increase the probability of finding DOIs during review sampling by integrating all available data sources, such as historical defect attributes from optical inspection, context information of the inspection recipe, design hotspots and metrology measurements. In addition to review sampling, this paper also illustrates other applications based on machine learning defect prediction, such as virtual process window discovery, and predicted defect types for trend monitoring. A predictive analytics platform was employed to allow defect type prediction based upon multiple inputs.", "We have demonstrated the successful operation of a multi-beam scanning electron microscope with 331 electron beams for the first time. This makes it the world\u2019s fastest SEM. The underlying architecture of the existing multi-beam mSEM technology fully supports the scale-up of the number of electron beams to 331. Scaling beyond this number is feasible.", "This paper, originally published on 26 March 2019, was replaced with a corrected/revised version on 25 June 2019. If you downloaded the original PDF but are unable to access the revision, please contact SPIE Digital Library Customer Service for assistance.", "As EUV approaches its insertion point into high volume manufacturing the semiconductor industry is increasingly focusing on photoresist performance. Recently metal containing resists have been proposed as alternatives to standard Chemically Amplified (CA) systems. Both approaches suffer from an incomplete knowledge of the EUV imaging mechanism. In particular the origin, number and fate of the secondary electrons believed to be active in the resist reactions is poorly understood. In this contribution we describe a study designed to try and characterize these processes and quantify the reactions that determine resist performances. We will describe experiments on a series of model CA systems doped with inorganic salts. Photoacid yields and relative rates of deprotection will be reported for metal salts that can be incorporated into polymer films at concentrations as high as 10 molal. In addition to comparing the relative performance at EUV we will also be characterizing the response at 248 nm and 100 KeV e beam. The results of these studies will be discussed in terms of the metal ion crossection, ionization potential and redox potential. In addition we will describe some unanticipated EUV reactivity of standard acid indicators that may impact the accepted electron yield/photospeed measurements that have been reported for EUV CA resists.", "The looming industry transition towards EUV for high-volume manufacture of semiconductors has demonstrated the need for high sensitivity resists capable of delivering the resolution enhancements offered by the 13.5 nm platform. Inorganic and organometallic based resists have demonstrated themselves viable alternatives to traditional chemically amplified (CA) photoresists, as the EUV absorptivity enhancement of metal nuclei can enable efficient reactivity at minimal photon doses. Despite the demand for EUV photoreactive materials, relatively little has been reported on the fundamental reactivity of inorganic and organometallic compounds towards EUV that may enable the rational design of metal-based resists. To facilitate the design of next-generation metal-based resists, we have evaluated the reactivity of well-known metal-based model photosystems that undergo ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT), metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT), outer-sphere charge-transfer (OSCT), and ligand field (LF) based photochemistry in the UV and visible towards EUV and 100 KeV e-beam, with product characterization carried out by infrared, Raman, and UV-Vis spectroscopies. We will report the findings of these studies, emphasizing the relationships between quantum yields in the UV-Vis and EUV, role of the EUV absorption cross-section of the central metal, and trends in reaction classes and their relative sensitivity towards EUV.", "The design of viable imageable photoresist materials for Extreme Ultra-Violet, EUV (13.5 nm), radiation requires the understanding of the energy conduits that form to deliver chemically relevant resonant energies within a material, Starting with absorption of a \uf07e92 eV ionizing radiation that, upon absorption, initiates a spawning of photoelectrons and secondary electrons that distribute energy across the population of generated secondary electrons with each subsequent generation\u2019s electrons increasing in number and lower in average energy until they attain 0 eV. The loss of energy is the result of both elastic and inelastic scattering. At energies above 30 eV absorption is localized to atoms on the molecules in the resist matrix and the electrons that are spawned continue to react locally until then around 30-20 eV, the deep-valence region, they begin to delocalize and with continued ionization until 10 eV, that below this interacting through the molecular orbitals, the secondary electrons begin to react as virtual photons until below 3 eV where they attain energies that resonate with vibrational energies to form stable free radicals and ions that if not trapped by a molecule with a resonant low lying unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) may be captured by a hole in the material or substrate or they may get trapped in the material system as they are, without reacting. The resist designer applies knowledge concerning the interaction of high energy particles and photons with gases and biological systems to the lower energies used for lithography truncating at below 3 eV in the condensed matter of the polymeric resist matrix. This truncation occurs because the role of (quantum) resonance of a molecular bond with a \u201cvirtual photon\u201d is typically between 3 and 5 eV. However, because of the presence of excess electron, stable anions, and radicals (as) reactants this truncation is erroneous; and chemistries may occur at energies approaching 0 eV. These chemistries result from vibrational resonances of the transient electron with a low energy unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the matrix molecules. This behavior is quantum in nature and is not classical. This paper discusses the radiolysis processes as follows: 1. the local nonmolecular processes from 92 eV photon absorption to 30 eV, 2. then the ionization in the deep valence below 30 eV to 10 eV, 3. followed by the region of virtual photons from10 eV to 3 eV, 4. and then examine below 3 eV to 0 eV to finish. Describing the processes in the higher energy regions is difficult due to the short attosecond to femtosecond reaction time-resolution to monitor them but the paper proposes methods to accomplish. Below 30 eV the plasmonic charging work function pose problems for some methods like Total Electron Yield measurements of low energy electrons but time resolved and various analytical methods using EUV exposure will prove useful. The paper concludes by looking at the relationship to line-edge-roughness, stochastic print failures, and research opportunities that will take us to the edge of EUV lithographic chemistry.", "Extreme-ultraviolet (~13.5 nm) lithography is much different than the previous lithographic wavelength such that chemical reactions within the resist are caused by electrons generated from ionization. As the lithographic community moves towards printing more advanced nodes, the secondary electron blur from extreme-ultraviolet photons becomes more critical. Understanding the range of the secondary electrons from the photoionization site would provide insight into patterning capabilities for different photoresists and aid in the development of improved models. Here, we aim to determine the range of electrons by measuring the thickness loss due to top-down electron beam exposure. More importantly, this work focuses on measuring the thickness loss due to incident electrons with energies less than 80 eV for two different resist systems: (1) a chemically amplified photoresist where acid diffusion affects the depth of solubility changing reactions, and (2) a non-chemically amplified photoresist, PMMA, where no acid diffusion occurs. Photoresists are exposed to electrons, baked, and developed; subsequent ellipsometry is used to quantify the depth at which solubility changing reactions occur based on the incident energy and dose. Quencher concentration and post-exposure bake parameters are varied to mitigate acid diffusion to extrapolate the electron range. The results are then compared to the thickness loss of the non-chemically amplified photoresist.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is one of the most promising techniques in the semiconductor industry to enhance resolution, line edge roughness (LER) and sensitivity of chemically amplified resist (CAR) pattern. Post exposure bake (PEB) process, a major process in EUV lithography, has been studied by experimental approach, but they are confronted by time-consuming tasks for massive combinatorial research. Also, theoretical models have been reported to explain fundamental mechanism of the process, but the single-scale simulation studies show obvious limitations for accurate prediction of photo-chemical reactions in photoresist (PR) matrix and the resulting morphology of line pattern. In order to settle the problem, a multiscale model (density functional theory (DFT)-molecular dynamics (MD)-finite difference method (FDM) integration) was developed to simulate chemical reactions including PAG dissociation, acid diffusion, and deprotection of photoresist in our previous study, which is based on two-components system (PAG and PR). Herein, we propose the multiscale model for three molecular components consisting of PAG, PR, and photo-decomposable quencher (PDQ) which is widely used for fine PR pattern fabrication by neutralizing acid in unexposed region of the resist. The newly constructed model reflects more realistic acid diffusion and chemical reactions on PEB process. This achievement will be helpful to identify critical design parameters and suggest optimized design materials in EUV lithography process.", "Electronic processes in extreme ultraviolet lithography are key to understand chemical reactions that lead to exposure of photoresist because of recent evidence that even very low kinetic energy electrons (Ek \u2192 0 eV) might be very efficient in dissociating the molecules in photoresists. However, an assessment of the distribution of electrons involved in the cascade at kinetic energy approaching zero eV is not trivial in solid state. In this work, we use electron yield spectroscopy from thin photoresist films based on poly(hydroxystyrene) with and without photoacid generator (PAG). The results show that the addition of PAG boosts the electron yield by a factor 2 with respect to the polymer only photoresist. We then elaborate an analytical form of the transfer function that describes the physics of the photoemission by accounting for the energy distribution inside the photoresist material during exposure to extreme ultraviolet light. By fitting the model function to the spectroscopic data, we obtain an estimation for the distribution of electrons which lie inside the material at energy too low to be measured by an external detector, in other words the hidden tail of low energy electrons. For a quantitative comparison, we also use another approach based on MonteCarlo simulation of electronic scattering effects to calculate numerically the magnitude of the electron cascade. Using Chariot simulator, a statistically significant number of electronic trajectories (6 x107) was calculated and the energy distribution of electrons are compared both outside and inside the photoresist film.", "Resist Formulation Optimizer (RFO) is created to optimize resist formulation under EUV stochastic effects. Photosensitized Chemically Amplified ResistTM (PSCARTM) 2.0 reaction steps are included in the resist reaction model in RFO in addition to standard Chemically Amplified Resists (CAR) reaction steps. A simplified resist roughness calculation method is introduced in RFO. RFO uses \u201cfast stochastic resist model\u201d which uses continuous model information for stochastic calculation. \u201cResist component\u2019s dissolution inhibition model\u201d is also introduced for better prediction of different resist formulations in RFO. The resist component\u2019s dissolution inhibition model is used for calculation of both Dissolution Inhibition Slope (DIS) and Dissolution Inhibition Deviation (DID). By dividing DID by DIS at a pattern edge, Line Edge Roughness (LER) can be predicted. The RFO performance is validated to give low residual errors after calibration even for different resist formulations. RFO is designed to optimize the resist formulation to minimize resist roughness as a cost function with keeping target CD. RFO suggests that PSCAR 2.0 with Polarity Switching photosensitizer precursor (POLAS) in combination with photosensitizer (PS) image enhancement may provide reduced resist roughness. Simulations using a calibrated rigorous stochastic resist model for S-Litho show a good prediction of PSCAR 2.0 process performance.", "The RLS trade-off of EUV resists has been a major technical issue for high-volume manufacturing using EUVL. Significant attempts to develop of chemically-amplified resists, metal-containing resists, and a variety of other material classes have been made to obtain low LER at high resolution (R) and at a reasonable sensitivity (S). Previously, we have developed and reported work on silanol-containing polyhydrogensilsesquioxane resins and their use as negative tone resists. The developed silanol-containing polymer resists have demonstrated enhanced EUV sensitivity compared to traditional hydrogen silsesquioxane resins, and at the same time maintaining excellent etch properties. The resist may enable a bilayer stack technology in EUVL. Herein we report novel functionalized polyhydrogensilsesquioxane polymers and their use as negative tone resists. These materials exhibit improved LER/LWR and reasonably good EUV sensitivity. In best cases, data suggests no residues or bridging in the non-exposed areas. The optimized resist exhibits sub-20nm halfpitch resolution, low LER (2-3nm), and reasonable sensitivity (82.5 mJ/cm2). In addition, we also investigated the effect of three organic underlayers for EUV patterning and compared with the silicon substrate.", "Irresistible Materials (IM) is developing novel resist systems based on the Multi-trigger concept, which incorporates a dose dependent quenching-like behaviour. The Multi Trigger Resist is a non-metal based negative tone resist, and consists of a base molecule and a crosslinker, which represent the resist matrix, together with a photoacid generator (PAG). Previously presented MTR2 showed 16 nm half pitch lines patterned with a dose of 38 mJ/cm2, giving a LER of 3.7 nm on the NXE3300. Since then, research has been undertaken to improve this resist. In particular we are focusing on improved RLS; reduced top-loss and wiggling at high aspect ratios; eliminating the antimony PAG and further reduction of chemical stochastics. In this study, we present the approaches that have been taken to attain these goals and the initial results. Using the EUV Interference Lithography tool at PSI, a multi trigger resist with a high absorbance non-metal element included in the resist matrix, MTR2627, has been patterned at a pitch of 28nm with an estimated dose of 53mJ/cm2 and LER of 4.2nm. The LWR is improved in the low dose region, and results also show that a thicker film can be used without pattern collapse below pitch 32nm due to increased stiffness. Using the Berkeley MET tool, this resist matrix with a higher MTR ratio has patterned 24nm lines at a pitch of 48nm with an LER of 1.9nm with a dose of 65mJ/cm2. Additionally, we present initial results for an MTR resist series where the antimony PAG has been replaced with a carbon based PAG.", "The acid diffusion in chemically amplified resists (a current standard resist for semiconductor device manufacturing) is a significant concern in the development of highly resolving resists. However, non-chemically amplified resists (non- CARs) are generally less sensitive to radiation than CARs due to lack of amplification mechanism. Recently, a negativetype non-CAR resist utilizing polarity change and radical crosslinking (a dual insolubilization resist) was proposed. In this study, an acid reactive compound was introduced into the organotin-containing dual insolubilization resists to improve their sensitivity. The synthesized resists were composed of triarylsulfonium cations as a polarity changer and radical generator, 2,2,2-trisubstituted acetophenone as a radical generator, triphenyl(4-vinylphenyl)stannane (TPSnSt) as an EUV absorption enhancer and a quencher, and 4-[(2,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethyl]phenylmethacrylate (ARMA) as a polymer-bound acid-reactive unit. By the incorporation of ARMA, the sensitivity to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation was increased by 2.4 times (the exposure dose for insolubilization was decreased by approximately 60%). The sensitivity enhancement is considered to have been caused by the acid catalytic etherification of ARMA through dimerization and/or with 2,2,2-trisubstituted acetophenone units.", "In order to lower the cost of ownership of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) in high volume manufacturing (HVM), high sensitivity resists enabling high throughput are being investigated intensely. The concept that utilizes a Photosensitized Chemically Amplified ResistTM (PSCARTM) is a promising solution for achieving resist sensitivity without losing other required performance of the resist1-8. NEW PSCAR concept is promising high sensitivity resist overcoming RLS Trade-off, LER and stochastic defects. Main components of New PSCAR are precursor of photosensitizer (PPS), photo base generator (PBG), and chemically amplified resist (CAR). CAR is generally divided into two types: high and low activation types. The details of these two types of CAR have been investigated by many researchers9,10. Here, three main reactions of the NEW PSCAR based on high activation type CAR which is the current high-performance CAR: the process (1): EUV pattern exposure produces acids. The acids react with both quenchers (neutralization of acid-quencher) 11-14 and PPS (acid catalytic reaction of photosensitizer (PS) formation) 1-8 at room temperature. Much higher concentration of PS can be produced in NEW PSCAR\u3000\u3000than others, because the quencher concentration in CAR and PSCAR is generally much higher than NEW PSCAR. The process (2): Both acids and bases are generated in NEW PSCAR through excitation of PS and PBG by UV flood exposure, because only PS and PBG have absorption bands at UV flood exposure wavelength. The NEW PSCAR can produce high concentration of latent acids with the optimum latent acid-quencher distribution before PEB. The acid catalytic chain reaction (3) has been widely investigated all over the world and are reviewed15. Gallatin showed no fundamental differences in simulations among ArF, EB and EUV CARs after latent acid image formation before PEB16. There are many factors to affect LER formation17. The simulations indicate that LER is inversely proportional to the square root of exposure dose16,18-20. Experimentally LER decreases with increasing exposure dose21-24. NEW PSCAR can produce very high concentration of acid participating in deprotection reactions at image boundary, which reduces LER. It has been widely accepted that the main cause of LER in state-of-the-art resists is a chemical inhomogeneity generated at the image boundary 16,25-28. This suggests that LER is proportional to the width of the intermediate region. Because the width of the intermediate region can be approximated by using the chemical gradient (the gradient of the concentration of chemical compounds that determine the solubility of the resist), LER is inversely proportional to the chemical gradient29,30. Stochastic defects such as missing and kissing contact holes must be eliminated for EUVL HVM. But the detailed contribution of many factors affecting stochastic defects and the solution are not made clear in CAR. But decreasing LER and keeping pattern size made by enough latent acid concentration with optimum latent acid-quencher distribution before PEB suppress stochastic defects. For example, enough acid concentration suppresses missing contact holes and both decreasing LER and keeping pattern size suppress kissing contact holes. NEW PSCAR concept is promising high sensitivity resist overcoming RLS Trade-off, LER and stochastic defects.

Mack, \u201cA Simple Model of Line-Edge Roughness,\u201d Future Fab International, Issue 34 (2010)", "As the semiconductor industry continuously pursues smaller and more advanced device nodes, improving the lithographic performance of photoresists becomes more critical and challenging. The homogeneity of the photoresist formulation components within the thin film, such as the distribution of photoacid generator (PAG) molecules, are critical factors influencing resolving capability and the sidewall roughness after development. However, there is still lack of fundamental experimental approaches to probe the distribution of these components at the nanoscale throughout the photoresist film. Herein, we present the use of a new methodology, namely, massive cluster secondary ion mass spectrometry (MC-SIMS), to determine PAG homogeneity on a 10-15 nm scale within a photoresist film. In comparison to conventional SIMS, of which the detection spatial resolution is limited to large domains and the data is aggregated prior to analysis, MC-SIMS bombards the sample with a sequence of massive Au400 +4 nanoprojectiles, each separated in time and space, collecting and mass analyzing the co-emitted secondary ions from each projectile impact. Each sample is analyzed with a large quantity (106-107) of individual projectile impacts within an analysis area 125 \u03bcm in diameter. Analysis of co-emission of these independent 106-107 mass spectra allows for identification of co-localized molecules within nanodomains ~10-15 nm diameter and ~10 nm in depth (the emission area of a single impact) from the film surface. This unique method therefore reveals spatial distributions of molecules at the nanoscale.\nUsing MC-SIMS methodology, we directly measured key factors influencing the PAG homogeneity at the nanoscale including (1) PAG concentration, (2) the nature of the polymer matrix, (3) the nature of the PAG, and (4) additives. We discovered that 85-95% of PAG salts aggregate at the nanoscale. The majority of the PAG aggregates are less than 10 nm in size and are highly homogeneously distributed within the polymer matrix in the film. Furthermore, the size of the PAG aggregates can be manipulated by additives through an ion-exchange mechanism.", "Polymeric resist materials are a critical part of the lithographic patterning process. Understanding their behavior, particularly at extreme dimensions becomes challenging: the presence of a rigid substrate or free surface, chemical interactions, and stochastic fluctuations can all play a role. Continuum models for polymer material behavior at small length scales not only become inaccurate, but also fail to capture the statistical variations that must be understood in order to determine what are the ultimate limits to producing defect-free structures. Experimental measurement of nanoscale heterogeneities in polymer properties is difficult. Many of the techniques that possess the required spatial resolution use energetic beams of electrons that rapidly damage soft materials, while x-ray or neutron scattering methods provide only ensemble average measurements. Individual fluorescent molecules, however, can yield a significant amount of information about their local environment. Measurements of the fluorescence lifetimes of suitably engineered fluorophores have long been used in the life sciences to probe local pH, and oxygen, or Ca2+ concentration. Lifetimes may also be sensitive to viscosity, giving information about local molecular configurations at nanosecond timescales. Measurements of fluorophore orientation, and rotational mobility, can indicate local molecular ordering and mobility, respectively. While the use of single-molecule fluorescence imaging methods in the life sciences has progressed rapidly, its use in materials science has been slower to develop, with only a handful of studies related to lithographic materials. One principal reason for this is that, in materials, fluorophore orientation is often fixed. Single-molecule images therefore have a complex, orientation-dependent structure, that, if not correctly accounted for, can lead to large errors in determining their position and orientation. Reducing the positional inaccuracies to the few-nanometer or better level, requires more sophisticated approaches to fitting single-molecule images and novel imaging hardware. With these approaches, both the location and orientation of individual fluorophores can be determined accurately. This information, when combined with single molecule lifetime measurements can, in principle, provide nanometer scale on the structure and dynamics of polymeric materials. I will discuss our progress in making accurate and precise measurements of fluorophore position and orientation in materials to enable high-resolution imaging, our development of a straightforward approach to determine how localization uncertainty and fluorophore labeling density together limit our ability to resolve nanoscale structures, how lithographic patterning enables us to partially overcome that limit, and how single-molecule orientation measurements can provide information on deformation in polymers at the 10 nm length scale. Finally, I will speculate on how measurement of single-molecule fluorescence lifetimes might provide information on local polymer heterogeneity at various stages of the image formation process in lithographic material systems.", "Linewidth Roughness (LWR) remains a difficult challenge for improvement in all resist materials. In previous work we focused on the impact of key components of LWR by analyzing the Power Spectral Density (PSD) curves which can be obtained using Fractilia\u2019s MetroLER computational software. [1] By measuring the unbiased PSD (with SEM image noise removed), accurate assessment of PSD(0) (the low-frequency limit of the PSD) and correlation length (the length scale of the transition from white to correlated noise) is possible. We showed there was an important relationship between ArF resist frequency components and LWR through lithographic process (before and after a resist trim step) as a function of resist formulation. In this paper we will study how key frequency components such as PSD(0) and correlation length change as we vary basic resist properties such as diffusion. The impact of aerial image on LWR and its frequency components will also be studied with particular attention to how correlation length affects LWR as feature size decreases. We will also look at the impact of diffusion or resist blur on PSD(0) as a function of aerial image Normalized Image Log-Slope (NILS). Understanding the relationship between PSD(0) and correlation length and how to manipulate these variables to minimize LWR for different features is crucial for more rapid LWR improvement at different nodes.

This formulation can achieve a two-fold improvement in resolution without the need for new equipment or significant changes in processing conditions. The photoresist matrix used in this work is poly[4-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)oxy] styrene] (PTBOC), which is employed in combination with a PAG in 248 nm resists. When exposed to light, the PAG decomposes to form acid which, upon post-exposure baking, deprotects multiple pendant groups on the PTBOC to produce hydroxyl groups, thereby changing its solubility. This polymer exhibits another key feature: the dissolution rate with respect to dose has a threshold-like response, meaning that below a threshold dose, the polymer will not appreciably dissolve in a developer containing tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH), but above this dose, the dissolution rate increases several orders of magnitude. This behavior becomes vital at feature sizes that approach theoretical resolution limits where the aerial image near the photoresist becomes more sinusoidal. Because the dissolution rate is controlled by the acid content within the polymer matrix, it is possible to cross this dissolution threshold twice with increasing dose if the acid is somehow quenched at higher doses. A PBG is an easy way to achieve this goal. If a PBG is chosen such that it is decomposes more slowly than the PAG and is incorporated with a stochiometric excess, then this dissolution threshold may be crossed twice. The addition of a PBG generates three different regimes with respect to dose: At low doses, neither the PAG nor PBG will have appreciably decomposed and the resist remains insoluble in aqueous base. At medium doses, enough acid will be generated by the PAG to cross the threshold, with too little PBG decomposition to effectively quench said acid. At high doses, both the PAG and PBG have mostly decomposed and the net acid concentration will be below the dissolution threshold. If the relative rates of the PAG and PBG can be tuned such that these two dissolution thresholds properly match the sinusoid intensity profile, the resolution of patterns can be improved by a factor of two. Dr. Xinyu Gu previously demonstrated the feasibility of such a system for 193 nm tools [1]. In this work, we report several combinations of PAGs and PBGs that meet the above criteria and show promise for exhibiting pitch-division. In some cases, a photosensitizer was needed to enable the decomposition of the PAG. These combinations were tested by exposing a film to a given dose and then developing in an aqueous solution of TMAH. It was found that the relative dissolution rates closely match the ideals as described above. These combinations are ready for testing with an exposure tool to verify and optimize their function as a pitch division photoresist.

Several excellent study have been introduced before and it mainly focused on the relation between defect number and pattern size and pattern pitch. Unfortunately, the study related defect transfer behavior haven\u2019t been quite few, despite defect inspection is executed through top-down SEM.\nIn this study, latent defect on via hole pattern, especially, the behavior of invisible hole bottom area was focused on and we tied to clarify the exist of hidden missing defect utilizing unique RIE technique in hole image transfer onto under layer.", "While the semiconductor industry has reached the high-volume manufacturing of the 7 nm technology node (N7), patterning processes for future technology nodes N5, N3 and even below, are being investigated and developed by research centers. To achieve the critical dimensions of gratings for these future technology nodes, we require multipatterning approaches, such as self-aligned double/quadruple/octuple patterning (SADP/SAQP/SAOP) and multiple litho-etch (LE) patterning, in combination with 193i lithography and even EUV lithography. These gratings need to be subsequently cut or blocked, which is typically done by one or more block masks. As the edge placement error (EPE) budget drastically decreases with decreasing critical dimensions, the standard LE block patterning scheme is not sufficient anymore. To relax the EPE budget, dedicated scaling boosters are required such as the self-aligned block scheme, which defines blocks in trenches, selectively to the neighboring trenches.\nIn this work we explore the different multipatterning options for lines and blocks at pitches below 20 nm. As such, we will demonstrate and compare three different patterning options to enable 16 nm pitch gratings: 193i-based SAOP, EUV-based SADP and EUV-based SAQP. Finally, we will also elaborate on a self-aligned patterning scheme which does not define lines and blocks sequentially anymore but integrates them in a mixed mode. This patterning approach (SALELE) makes use of two LE masks and two self-aligned block masks. We will present its development status at relaxed pitch (28 nm) and discuss its advantages for future technology nodes.", "In 5 nm FinFET technology and beyond, SRAM cell size reduction to 6 tracks is required with a fin pitch of 24 nm. Fin depopulation is mandatory to enable the area scaling, but it becomes challenging at small pitches. In the first part, each process flow is simulated in order to obtain a 3D model of a FinFET SRAM device. Layout dependent effects on silicon and process non-idealities are characterized in a second part and used to calibrate the 3D model. In the third part, a process sensitivity analysis is conducted to compare the impact of overlay and CD variations on various options.", "Area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) has received a great deal of attention in recent years because of its potential to provide a more robust and controllable fabrication process for next generation electronic devices. In this paper, we study selective deposition of metal oxides on Cu/low-k dielectric patterns. We demonstrate that the inherent growth rate of ALD films is higher on Cu than on low-k surfaces, which indicates the importance of using organic molecules as an inhibitor to prevent ALD growth on Cu surfaces if the goal is to achieve area-selective deposition of materials on lowk surfaces. We show that vapor-phase dodecanethiol (DDT) can be used as an inhibitor. DDT is selectively deposited on Cu surfaces and is effective at ZnO ALD blocking with selectivity greater than 90% after 100 ALD cycles (~17 nm). With the optimization of DDT deposition temperature and Al2O3 deposition conditions, the blocking ability of DDT against a more aggressive precursor is further improved and shows selectivity above 90% after 1.5 nm Al2O3 deposition.", "Lithography faces an increasing number of challenges as errors in pattern overlay and placement become increasingly significant as scaling continues. The flexibility of removing a lithography step offers a significant advantage in fabrication as it has the potential to mitigate these errors. Furthermore, this strategy also relaxes design rules in semiconductor fabrication enabling concepts like self-alignment. The use of selective area atomic layer deposition with self-assembled monolayers that incorporate different side group functionalities was evaluated in the deposition of a sacrificial etch mask. Monolayers with weak supramolecular interactions between components (e.g. Van der Waals) were found to exhibit significant defectivity when depositing this material at and below 100nm feature sizes. The incorporation stronger supramolecular interacting groups in the monolayer design, such as hydrogen bonding units or pi-pi interactions, did not produce an added benefit over the weaker interacting components. However, incorporation of reactive moieties in the monolayer component enabled the subsequent reaction of a SAM surface generating a polymer at the surface and providing a more effective barrier, greatly reducing the number and types of defects observed in the selectively deposited ALD film. These reactive monolayers enabled the selective deposition of a film with critical dimensions as low as 15nm. The deposited film was then used as an effective barrier for standard isotropic etch chemistries, allowing the selective removal of a metal without degradation to the surrounding surface. This work enables selective area ALD as a technology by (1) the development of a material that dramatically reduces defectivity and (2) the demonstrated use of the selectively deposited film as an etch mask and its subsequent removal under mild conditions.", "Selective deposition holds promise to simplify next-generation device fabrication and bring down economic cost. In this work, selectively depositing polymers on metal/dielectric patterns was achieved by spin dewetting, a phenomenon that refers to the dewetting of polymers during spin coating. Our strategy utilizes self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to induce dewetting of polymers over some areas. Line patterns of Cu/SiO2 were investigated. A hydrophobic SAM, octyltrichlorosilane (OTS, Cl3Si\u2013C8H17), was selectively formed on SiO2 in the presence of Cu to render SiO2 non-wettable. During a subsequent spin coating step, polymers dewet from OTS-functionalized SiO2 and coat Cu exclusively. The spin dewetting process is strongly dictated by the spin coating kinetics. A systematic study of the processing conditions revealed strong dependence of polymer film coverage on spin speed, solution concentration, polymer molecular weight, casting solvent, and SAM hydrophobicity.", "As devices become ever smaller and more sophisticated, there is also a general need for creating high quality defect-free thin coatings of polymers on 3-dimensional wafer topography, for example, for shrinkage of the size of trench openings. To address this challenge, we developed a spin-on polymer brush material, which comprises of a dopant moiety with a universal adhesive dopamine end group. We demonstrate that the polymer coating is highly conformal and free of pinhole defects, even when only a few nm thick, or when coated over high aspect ratio over 200 nm deep trench topography. Our investigations demonstrate that the dopamine end group enables stable sub-10 nm thick conformal coatings on three-dimensional surfaces.\nFurthermore, on acute 3-dimensional semiconductor topography, the creation of highly doped abrupt, ultra-shallow junctions with three-dimensional control are essential for successful source-drain contacts. In consideration of this need, we extended the above polymer brush concept further by incorporating a suitable implant dopant atom, such as boron, into the monomer structure. After conformal coating and a subsequent rapid thermal annealing process, the dopant atom is driven into the semiconductor substrate underneath the polymer film. This is potentially very useful for uniform all-around doping of 3-dimensional topography such as FinFETs or Nanowire-FETs. A high dopant dosage on silicon substrate with appropriate shallow implant characteristics was demonstrated for the end-functionalized dopant polymer brush, highlighting one of the promising applications of such conformal coatings.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is one approach to the pattern density multiplication required to achieve high-volume manufacturing of the next-generation memory and storage devices. One important application for DSA is in manufacturing of nanoimprint templates for the next-generation bit patterned media. A hybrid chemo-/grapho-epitaxy DSA process has been developed that produced 5 nm line-and-space DSA patterns on a chromium hard mask surface. The guide lines for this process were produced by imprint lithography. The process requires a polar guide stripe, which is the trim-etched imprint resist, and a near neutral substrate, which is the etched chromium. This requires selective grafting of near neutral polymer brushes to the etched chromium and not to the etched imprint guidelines. This selectivity is one critical requirement for the process [1]. Orientation and alignment of line-and-space patterns that traverse through the entire BCP film were successfully employed to pattern the chromium hard mask. We have investigated the reactivity of etched chromium surfaces with various polymer brush chemistries and found that the choice of the end-functional groups, monomer structures, and grafting temperature all play significant roles in selective functionalization. The etched chromium surface was found to be more reactive with various polymer brushes than etched silicon under mild brush grafting conditions. Hence, lower grafting temperatures could be exploited for achieving selectivity of polymer brush to the etched chromium while not reacting with the etched imprint guidelines. Thus, several polymer brushes that form a thin layer of brush on etched chromium were found to modify the surface energy of the etched chromium without significant interaction with the etched imprint resist. Successful pattern transfer of 5 nm line-and-space patterns was achieved. 1. Lane, A. P., et al.

Various amines were used for the ester-amide exchange reaction to introduce a small number of methacrylamide units into the PMMA block of the parent PS-b- PMMA. A small-angle X-ray scattering analysis revealed that a tiny amount of the methacrylamide units led to a significant increase in the incompatibility between the blocks. Consequently, we obtained a lamellar microphaseseparated structure with a domain-spacing as small as 11.1 nm through the simple post-polymerization modification of low-molecular-weight PS-b-PMMA. More importantly, directed self-assembly for the modified PS-b-PMMAs was demonstrated using topographically prepatterned silicon substrates with a PS brush layer, thus highlighting the practical utility of the proposed method in next generation nanolithographic applications.", "As a potential solution to next-generation nanolithography, directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is still restrained in high volume manufacturing primarily due to its defectivity issue. Though defects possess greater free energies than aligned morphologies and are highly energetically unfavorable, they can be kinetically trapped and persist for a long time during annealing. Understanding the kinetics of defect annihilation is crucial to revealing the mechanism of defect formation and to further reducing defectivity in DSA. In this work, we focus on two types of predominant defects in DSA\u2014\u2014dislocation and bridge. Statistical analysis of experimental data reveals that dislocation annihilation follows power law, and dislocations are expected to be fully eliminated by long annealing time. On the other hand, bridge defects decrease exponentially with annealing time, and reach a plateau at long annealing time. We also study the impact of annealing temperature and film thickness on annihilation kinetics, and discover that thicker film shows lower bridge density yet significantly slower kinetics. Finally we discuss the impact of etching on bridge reduction. Though these findings are based on polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA), we anticipate they could be applied to other BCP platforms as well.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) is one of the candidates for next generation lithography. Over the past years, many papers and presentation have been reported regarding DSA, and Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL is a registered trademark or a trademark of Tokyo Electron Limited in Japan and /or other countries.) also has presented the evaluation results and the advantages of each 1-8. Especially, the chemo-epitaxy process has advantages for the sub 20nm line and space patterns to apply to active area patterns for DRAM, fin patterns for Logic and narrow pitch of metal patterns. One of the biggest advantages of DSA lines is that the pattern pitch is decided by the specific factors of the block copolymer, and it achieves the small pitch walking as a consequence. On the other hand, the chemo-epitaxy process can be applied to the hexagonal close-packed arrangement holes 8. Those holes are expected to be the patterns for DRAM storage. In this paper, the latest results regarding the defect reduction work regarding chemo-epitaxy line and space pattern is reported. Especially, the defect density of the patterns that were transferred to spin on carbon (SOC) film is confirmed.", "Silicon-containing block copolymers are considered promising materials for high resolution pattern generation through directed self-assembly. The nonpolar organo-silicon moieties result in a high Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (\u03c7) when paired with a polar block, allowing features well below 20 nm full pitch to be generated. In addition, the incorporation of silicon provides excellent dry etch selectivity under a variety of reactive ion etching conditions. However, similar to all block copolymer systems under development, achieving sufficiently low defect density remains a critical hurdle for implementation of directed self-assembly into high volume manufacturing. This work reports our progress towards this end, using a chemo-epitaxy flow to direct the assembly of poly(4-trimethylsilylstyrene-block-4- methoxystyrene), resulting in sub-20 nm full pitch line/space patterns. This process employs 193 nm immersion lithography to define the guide structure and is run on 300 mm wafers in a fab-like environment. Our efforts in understanding the possible root cause(s) of the dominant defect modes and reducing the total defect density of the flow will be described. This study includes research on the influence of various process parameters as well as the chemical compositions of the different materials involved, and their interactions with specific defect modes.", "This paper presents how to use machine learning to accelerate the development of lamellar block copolymer process. The first part introduces an automated algorithm to measure lamellar CD-SEM images oriented to allow fast images screening, identify and select the most relevant chemical composition. The second part is the use of machine learning in the process development which is a data driven approach. This part is also divided in two sections, the first one for the prediction of the process, where having a set of experiments in a process window, a model is created so that the outcome from is estimated from different parameters. The second part is the estimation of the process window. These tools are oriented to assist process engineers in the process optimization which must be driven under expert supervision.", "Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is used to evaluate the composition of nonvolatile photoproducts created by EUV photolysis of antimony carboxylate photoresists [R3Sb(O2CR\u2032)2]. Dozens of potential photoproduct ions were identified using exact mass and 121Sb/123Sb isotopic ratios. Several oxygen-rich antimony ions were found to increase in abundance with exposure. Two methods were employed to identify photoproducts which create solubility contrast. First, samples were analyzed pre- and post-development to examine the effects of EUV exposure and developer solvent on secondary ion intensity. Secondly, changes in intensity of select ions were compared to dissolution contrast over a range of doses. Through these studies, ion intensities were found to correlate with dissolution contrast for several fragments, indicating their active role in creating negative-tone response.", "In response to the difficulties posed by the resolution, line edge roughness, sensitivity (RLS) trade-off to traditional chemically amplified resist (CAR) systems used for extreme ultraviolet lithography, a number of novel resist technologies have been proposed. In this paper, the effect of quencher loading on three resist technologies is analyzed via an error propagation-based resist simulator. In order of increasing novelty as well as complexity, they are: conventional CAR with quencher, CAR with photodecomposable base, and PSCAR 2.0, a CAR system with photodecomposable base as well as an EUV-activated UV-sensitive resist component. Simulation finds the more complicated resist systems trade in an increase in resist stochastics for improved deprotection slopes, yielding a net benefit in terms of line width roughness.", "We propose a concept of organic small molecule-based EUV resists that do not require sub-stoichiometric ingredients. Based on our previous results with highly fluorinated electron-beam (e-beam) resists, we designed amorphous small molecules equipped with perfluoroalkyl ether (PFAE) chains. The synthesis of the prototype was carried out successfully, and its physical properties, imaging mechanism, and performance were all evaluated under e-beam exposure conditions. Although the prototype showed slightly low sensitivity to EUV irradiation, we were able to mitigate the issue by appending other cross-linkable functional moieties. The modified version showed decent negative-tone patterning performance under e-beam exposure and could form images under EUV irradiation and the pattern development step using highly fluorinated solvents.", "Underpinning the Electronic Revolution over the last 50 years is the development of sophisticated patterning materials which have enabled the elegant semiconductor chip design. Of central importance is the photoresist material which has been custom designed for shrinking exposure wavelengths. Polymer chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and photochemistry have all played important roles in the design and development of photoresist materials. Ancillary lithographic materials have also been implemented to solve critical lithographic issues such as antireflection control, leaching and outgassing, and pattern transfer. It can be safely stated that without the creative inventions of lithographic materials by chemists and engineers the Electronic Revolution would not happen. This presentation will introduce the critical chemistry and engineering solutions that led to the development of these enabling lithographic materials.", "EMD Performance Materials provides a broad material portfolio for photolithography, Chemical Shrink and EUV Rinse materials are two categories of aqueous materials enabling advanced patterning. Chemical Shrink materials generate an additional layer on the surface of photoresist pattern through chemical/physical interactions, resulting in finer trench or hole structures. The technique helps IC manufacturers improve process margin and reduce cost of ownership by relaxing the requirements for lithography. EMD has been engaged in development of the technology for over two decades, and introduced materials for multiple generations of lithography. The first generation Chemical Shrink material, AZ\u00ae R200 was commercialized for i-line and KrF applications around 2000. From then on, several commercial platforms were released targeting for ArF, ArF-immersion, and ArF NTD (Negative Tone Development) photoresists. Shrink amount depends on the material platforms and photoresists, it can be controlled from several nm to 100 nm with the process conditions, mainly shrink bake temperature. Well-controlled through-pitch proximity is one of the key advantages of the technique as well. Chemical shrink process is a straightforward and well-established in-track process. Not only smaller pattern sizes are achieved, effective DOF (Depth of Focus) is improved, but also surface smoothing of photoresist is expected. Rinse materials are a unique offering from EMD to alleviate capillary force hence mitigate pattern collapse in very fine photoresist pattern through reducing surface tension with novel surfactants. Based on the knowledge and know-hows learned during the development of rinse materials for ArF and ArF immersion lithography processes in the past decades, new material platforms have been developed to extend the technique to meet the ever more critical requirements in EUV lithography. AZ\u00ae Extreme 10 was commercialized as the world first rinse material dedicated for EUV lithography, designed for L/S (Line and Space) pattern of 22nm hp patterning. To further improve the compatibility with the latest EUV photoresists for finer pattern, 18nm hp and beyond, AZ\u00ae SPC-708 is newly commercialized in 2018. It is expected that AZ\u00ae SPC-708 helps reduce photoresist residues during development process in addition to its function of collapse mitigation. EMD Performance Materials is committed to providing novel solutions to confront the increasing technical challenges in advanced patterning.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, using 13.5 nm radiations, is almost ready for high volume manufacturing. EUV lithography is expected to be the main technology for manufacturing leading-edge devices and continuous improvement of lithography performance is still needed. We have developed several metal oxide containing resists and recently focused on metal organic cluster photoresists with controlled size distribution. In this paper, material properties and lithography performance of our new metal organic cluster photoresists are discussed.", "Inpria is a leader in the development of high-performance photoresist materials for EUV lithography. By design, these photoresists enable patterning at extremely small pitches, exhibit high EUV absorption to reduce the photon shot noise otherwise amplified in conventional resists, and provide high etch selectivity to provide a large process window. Such characteristics derive from the metal oxide molecular cluster composition of the resists and the small, highly homogeneous building blocks this chemistry enables. We will present recent advances to Inpria photoresist platforms which have resulted in improved RLS performance, process stability, and photospeed tunability. We demonstrate the patterning capabilities for specific use cases in logic and memory applications, including the performance after etch. For patterning on an NXE:3300, the materials deliver large process windows both for line/space features at 26nm pitch needed for logic metal patterning and for the 43nm pitch hex pillar arrays required for DRAM applications. Pilot-scale batches of Inpria\u2019s resists are routinely produced on our production line. We will review our manufacturing facility and the capabilities of our formulation process scaled to support the production requirements of leading device manufacturers.", "There are many points in the photochemical ecosystem where variability can be addressed with chemistry and hardware solutions. From the purification of resist components to the final post develop rinse, there are many points at which defects can be created or eliminated. As the possible combinations of chemistries increase to achieve ever-shrinking nodes, the portfolio of photochemical filtration to reduce defects, variability, and downtime must also grow.\nSuppliers to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and photochemical manufacturers are constantly innovating to ensure their solutions address new defect challenges. In the 1980s, when the minimum feature size was approaching 1.0 \u03bcm, 0.2 \u03bcm filters were used to eliminate the largest particles in photochemical manufacturing. As the industry pursues the sub-7 nm node, conventional filtration technology is challenged to meet industry needs. Membrane pore size reduction alone is no longer a tenable approach to meet evolving process requirements, and creative approaches to eliminate defects must be developed to meet these challenges.\nThis overview will provide process engineers insight into the complexity of filtration to reduce defect variability and downtime. The many factors that impact filtration efficacy will be reviewed, including complete filter design, material selection, membrane morphology, wettability, and fluid dynamics. New technological approaches under consideration will be discussed. Data will be presented to demonstrate promise of these new approaches and where they could lead us in the future.", "A new 2 nm rated Nylon filter was developed to have features required for lithography filtration process such as finer pore size, extended contact time for adsorption enhancement and updated cleanliness for faster start-up. The contact time is extended by 1.6 times of the 10 nm rated product in the same sized capsule filter. Finer pore size is achieved and demonstrated by the removal performance of gold nanoparticles. For start-up performance, particles and metal cleanliness were improved.\nTo validate the features applied for the new 2 nm Nylon filter, on-wafer tests are conducted in comparison to conventional product such as 5 nm Nylon filter. Filter start up performance is tested with KLA Tencor Surfscan SP5XP inspection on solvent spin coated Si wafer. For bridge defects, 40 nm half pitch after development pattern defectivity with ArF immersion lithography is tested. The new 2 nm rated Nylon 6,6 filter performed best for all the tests. Cleanliness probably played a role in start-up performance. Sieving, which is related to filter pore size was effective in resist coating defectivity. And both the finer pore size and hydrophilic adsorption are effective in after development inspection at 40 nm half pitch L/S pattern, which is nearly the theoretical limit of the ArF immersion lithography.", "The use of multilayer processes in advanced ArF patterning schemes continues to increase as device critical dimensions shrink. In a multilayer stack, underlayer materials play a critical role in terms of gap fill, planarization and etch resistance to enable high resolution and high aspect ratio patterning. The emerging quadlayer imaging process requires a unique spin on carbon (SOC) layer with high thermal stability to withstand subsequent deposition of an inorganic hard mask layer, commonly deposited via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The thermal stability requirement associated with CVD compatibility largely limits the options of organic materials, which mostly decompose in the 300-450\u00b0C range. Thermal shrinkage and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) differences between layers are other key considerations in designing a high temperature stable, CVD compatible SOC material. Furthermore, the SOC polymer resin must be compatible with solvents and spin on products commonly used in the FAB. This paper highlights the development of a novel CVD compatible HT-SOC platform with excellent thermal stability (>500\u00b0C) and good FAB drain line compatibility. In addition, this polyaromatic SOC platform shows various improvements compared to traditional Novolacbased SOC, including reduced shrinkage, good gap fill, improved planarization, and low defectivity. Robust formulation design, high quality raw materials, and advanced metal removal technique synergistically enabled manufacturing of multigallon HT-SOC product with high quality. Application specific versions are available for more demanding planarization requirement and applications that require good adhesion to metal substrate. In addition, a newly developed method for quantitative measurement of long-range planarization was used to validate new material designs aimed at improving planarization.", "Regarding 3D semiconductor devices, one of difficulties is hardmask process for deep memory holes because of expensive process cost. To overcome this issue, cost effective hardmask process concept using hemicellulose SOC is newly proposed by spin-coat process and improved hardmask technology of hemicellulose SOC (made from bio-based green chemistry material). In this study, deep holes of micron scale were made after under layer RIE using hemicellulose SOC and reactive hemicellulose hardening process (R2H). RIE selectivity was extremely improved up to 65 by optimization of R2H strong process. The results show the feasibility of cost effective deep memory hole process for 3D devices. Additionally, EUV patterns (Hole CD of 24nm and L/S of hp18nm) in under layer were obtained by Hemicellulose SOC and R2H. Its aspect ratio was 15. The fine patterning results show a big potential for next generation memory and logic device processes.", "Irresistible Materials has previously introduced the HM340 and HM940 series of fullerene based spin-on carbon hardmasks, and reported on material characterization, including very high carbon content and high thermal stability. The materials have a low Ohnishi number providing high etch durability and the low hydrogen level allows for high-resolution etching without wiggling. In order to further increase thermal stability and etch resistance several new formulations are under development, including fullerene only hardmask materials.\nHere we present the latest results for our more conventional HM940 series, avoiding the drain test issues encountered with higher concentration HM340 formulations, together with new and updated characterisation results for the more advanced formulations.", "As the semiconductor manufacturing industry develops into the cutting-edge technology, the thick and high etch resistant material is required. Amorphous carbon layer (ACL), currently widely-used deposition-type film, can meet the requirement for etch resistance, but it has intrinsic problems such as darkness, defect control difficulty and low throughput which give limits to its further application. In order to overcome these problems, a novel thick spin-on carbon hardmask (SOH) is introduced in this paper. We designed the material from molecular level to achieve high etch resistance, good optical property, long shelf life and high thickness. Up to 3 micron-thick films with high transparency and etch resistance were successfully fabricated by spin-coating process. With long-enough shelf life for usage, we expect that this novel SOH can expand the possibility of spin-on material.", "A novel high-\u03c7 block copolymer polystyrene-b-polycarbonate (PS-b-PC) of the same system with three samples (1, 2, 3) which contain an active -NH- group on the polymer backbone between the PS block and the PC block have been successfully synthesized. It is believed that the hydrogen bond between -NH- and Si-OH (silanol) plays a dominant role which is as a real driving force to promote vertical micro-phase separation under the neutral layer free condition. The periods in which the samples 1, 2 and 3 form a vertical layer micro-phase separation are 10.6, 11.2 and 12.3nm, respectively. Though experiments, the best micro-phase separation process conditions were found (annealing temperature 160-165\u00b0C; annealing time 10 min) and the relevant parameters of PS-b-PC are also given. The results show that sample 2 of high-\u03c7 (0.19) has better phase separation performance, lower line-edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) than the other two samples. These diblock copolymer samples successfully achieved the directed self-assembly (DSA) of PS-b-PC under the condition that the designed silicon substrate groove did not need any neutral layer. Compared with the previously reported methods to orientation control BCPs with \u03c7 value and small vertical micro-phase separation while short-term thermal treatment demonstrates PS-b-PC as a rare and valuable candidate for advancing the field of nanolithography. This work will provide extremely important theories, valuable information and insights that apply to nanowire patterning by DSA in state-of-the-art semi-conduction devices.", "We have successfully synthesized polystyrene(PS)-b-polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) block copolymer that is precious with controlled molecular weight, PDI and composition ratio by living anionic polymerization method using large-scale apparatus. In addition, the influence of PDI, composition ratio and composition distribution for micro phase separation about PS-b-PMMA block copolymer is investigated. The results show that PDI is the major factor for defect, while composition ratio and composition distribution has influence for morphology. As PDI increase 1.06 to 1.13, also defects are increased a lot. As composition ratio of PS increase 51% to 60%, micro phase separation structure was changed from lamella to gyroid. Moreover, we surmised that these properties have a boundary of influence towards micro phase separation. Therefore, is necessary to control these properties by living anionic polymerization in order to use DSA materials in semiconductor process.", "Block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) is a promising technique to print Contact Holes/Vias with polymer blend materials or block copolymers. Polymer blend material is to mix block copolymer and homopolymer. In this paper, the materials we use are polymer blend materials with polystyrene-b-polycarbonate (PS-b-PC) block copolymer and corresponding homopolymer polystyrene. The advantage of polymers is that they do not require complex molecular design and can form cylindrical structures as long as the proportions are right. The polymer can be mixed and used immediately without waiting time. Based on the PS-b-PC which can form a stable lamellar structure, we achieve a controllable cylindrical structure by mixing the two materials and controlling the concentration. After multiple comparison experiments, the phase segregation results of PS-b-PC with PS ratio of 2:1 and 1.5:1 were better, with the diameter about 12.7nm and 14.1nm, and the pitch about 20nm and 22.7nm, respectively.", "Block copolymers (BCPs) can phase separate to form periodic structures with small spacings that can be used to form a template. This template can then be used to pattern higher densities of features onto a substrate, thus extending optical lithography. Thin films of BCPs can have their features guided via chemoepitaxy by employing underlayers with a patterned chemical preference towards one of the blocks. Line edge roughness (LER) is defined as the spatial variation of the interface between the two blocks and this can be transferred to the features patterned by the BCP template. Electrical components with high LER in their features are known to have performance issues. Here, a molecular dynamics simulation was employed to model BCP chains in a thin film state. The BCP chains have an angle potential acting on them described by the two parameters k\u03b8 and \u03b8eq. Stiffness was varied by changing either the chain's resistance to bending (k\u03b8) or how rod-like the chain is (\u03b8eq). It was found that while LER is unaffected by varying either parameter, line width roughness (variation in the width of a lamellae) increased with an increase in either parameter, though by an insignificant amount. Kinetic thin film simulations showed that increasing k\u03b8 increases the timescale for molecular diffusion while increasing \u03b8eq. potentially decreases the energetic barrier between a defect and defect-free state.", "The semiconductor community is well aware of the challenges that exist in developing lithographic methods that can pattern features at sub-20 nm periodic feature spacing (pitch, L0). Optical lithography already utilizes complex multiple patterning schemes to overcome diffraction limitations at 193-nm exposure wavelengths, and the delayed insertion of EUV lithography will likely require the use of multiple patterning or other assistive processes to further reduce the achievable feature sizes. An alternative to these techniques employs the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers. Block copolymers (BCPs) can naturally micro-phase separate into morphologies such as lamellae, cylinders, spheres, and gyroids at length scales down to sub-10 nm dimensions. Using the ability of BCPs to micro-phase separate in conjunction with alignment methods such as graphoepitaxy and chemoepitaxy to produce well-ordered structures, a process referred to as DSA, offers a possible method for producing sub-20 nm features in conjunction with optical patterning processes at greatly reduced cost and complexity. One of the many challenges in implementing line-space type DSA processes is the lack of methods for effective modulation and tuning of the pattern pitch (L0) produced by a given BCP. Previous studies have shown that blending homopolymer into the BCP thin films can allow for tuning of both: (1) L0 to be larger than that provided naturally by the BCP's molecular weight (MW) and (2) the relative size line-space size ratio. However, this tuning ability comes at the expense of increased line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR). It has also been shown that either higher or lower MW BCP can be blended into a primary BCP in order to modulate and tune the pattern pitch produced from the BCP mixture, but the effects of this BCP blending on pattern LER and LWR have not been explored or reported in detail. In this study, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of BCP DSA on a chemoepitaxial underlayer were implemented to characterize the impacts that blending controlled amounts of two different MW BCPs together have on DSA pattern LER and LWR. The blends shown here had LER and LWR values as much as 20% higher than those of pure, monodisperse BCPs; however, reducing the MW difference between the 2 BCPs could reduce this effect.", "The aim of this study is to lessen the number of defects by the simultaneous analyses of detection result via the lithography process and etch transfer performance. While defect requirements aren\u2019t as stringent for memory devices, logic devices must be defect-free. Currently, a defect which comes from the process or material can only be detected by top-down inspection approach, however, it is difficult to detect a defect such as underlying hole. To develop 5-nm logic node, a hole pattern 15 nm or smaller is required. Identification of failure at the bottom of the hole becomes more challenging. Nevertheless, the process window margin by the amount of dose/focus is not fully explored to find the defect occurrence tendency. So far, there are reported analyses on the scaling of pattern and pitches. In this paper, we report the process margin spotted on the amount of dose and the focus depth and the comprehensive process window including a view of defect-free.", "Multi-patterning, like LE and SAMP, has been in production for several years. It is expected to remain a standard in patterning, even in the case where industry adopts EUV photo lithography. As scaling continues, the precision of pattern placement remains challenging.\nEdge Placement Error (EPE) has been proposed to define the requirements of a patterning process. Many authors have created statistical models for EPE, and gathered statistical data for CD and overlay (OVL), to make predictions about future technology specifications1-5. This work makes the following contributions:\nEmphasis on large amount (63K) of on-product measurements\nUse of ANOVA table to assess the hypothesis that a contender process is better than a POR process To differentiate our work, we have used the stochastic variable IPFE (Interactive Pattern Fidelity Error), which is an indicator to quantify the quality of on-wafer edge placement accuracies in multi-patterning6. In our previous paper, we have studied how overlay, LCDU and pitch walk factor into the IPFE budget7. In this work, we focus on experimental verification of the expected relationships between LCDU, overlay and CD variation, applied to the case of SADP (block on spacer):\nWe re-confirm that population \u2018blocks-on-gap\u2019 have a worse IPFE performance than \u2018block-on-core\u2019\nWe determine experimental behavior of IPFE vs line CD, block CD, and overlay (w/o assumption for any model) From this exercise, we can conclude that this IPFE indicator is a robust metric for the managing quality of any integrated patterning scheme.", "The EUV photoproducts of antimony carboxylate photoresists [R3Sb(O2CR\u2032)2] are used to evaluate a possible free radical exposure mechanism by studying the change in molecular weight distribution with dose. We demonstrate the redistribution of carboxylate ligands across the metal centers in solution and use this property to create a statistical mono-olefin resist system with blended solutions of olefinic and non-olefinic antimony compounds that limit crosslinking and improve solubility of the photoproducts. Through gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis, we demonstrate the formation of high molecular weight oligomers with exposure dose and provide further support for the free-radical polymerization mechanism.", "Zirconium- and hafnium-based nanoparticles demonstrated good patterning behavior in deep-ultra-violet (DUV), electron-beam (E-beam) and extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography. Among these Zr- and Hf-based hybrid nanoparticles, the methacrylic acid (MAA) modified zirconium oxide nanoparticles1 (ZrO2-MAA-NP) give out the best over-all-performance: 26 nm lines are obtained at 4.2 mJ/cm2. However, both Zr and Hf are relatively low EUV absorbing metals2, and integration of high EUV absorption elements, such as Zn, is considered to be a more promising route to further improve lithographic performance under EUV radiation. Zinc-based nanoparticle photoresists, possessing ultra-small size, have exhibited promising sensitivities and better resolution. Here, we combined methacrylate ligand and high EUV absorption element Zn, to demonstrate a novel zinc oxide-based nanoparticle photoresist using a photo-radical generator (PRG). Compared with conventional photo-acid initiated nanoparticle-based photoresists, a better resolution and sensitivity has been found with the addition of photo-radical generator (PRG). This unique behavior is promising to provide new possibilities for rapid three-dimensional (3D) -printing.", "Advanced lithography techniques relying on innovations in scanner, track, and material technologies have been a consistent driver of Moore\u2019s Law. As these innovations transition from laboratories to factories, all members of the lithography value chain must adapt. Filtration technology has relied upon a subset of carefully matched materials to filter lithographic materials. The introduction of new materials for emerging lithography techniques creates the opportunity to seek alternatives to ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UPE), Nylon, and polypropylene.\nFluoropolymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA), have been used widely in the fab to filter chemistries that require instant surface wettability and high flow rates. These requirements now align more closely with today\u2019s leading-edge lithography materials. After a review of the motivation behind choosing new filtration materials in the lithography sector, this paper will identify the critical material attributes, specific design considerations, and the importance of membrane surface technologies, beginning in the photoresist manufacturing process. Data presented will include laboratory studies of fluoropolymer membranes in common solvents, on-wafer defect data, and bulk filtration manufacturing data, all showing the match between fluoropolymer filters and photolithography materials.", "Continued momentum in the development of EUV photolithography toward high volume manufacturing has driven the evolution of increased photoresist purity requirements. Further scaling will intensify the challenge to improve inline yield and reliability performance. The composition of EUV photoresist materials requires careful compositional balance and stability to ensure expected lithographic performance. It is therefore critical to understand and assess interactions between photomaterials and the many touchpoints along the entire value chain to maintain the purity and integrity of these materials.\nFiltration technology is an important part of maintaining a material\u2019s purity. When choosing a filter, there are many factors to consider, starting with the membrane material. For instance, nylon filters effectively remove polar polymers through an adsorption mechanism. Particulate contaminants are often removed by size-exclusion, mostly commonly observed with certain UPE (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) membranes. As lithography materials change and the smallest defects become even more challenging to detect, filtration technology innovation, such as the development of OktolexTM, is needed to meet the most stringent defect targets. In this paper, a tailored filter is introduced to enhance filtration performance and address specific defect sources in EUV photoresists. Results and possible mechanisms of the defect reduction will be discussed.", "ArF lithography is the primary technique used in leading edge semiconductor fabrication. However, as lithographers attempt to create manufacturable processes for N7 and future nodes, they are challenged to achieve improvements in cost of ownership and productivity. One means to reduce cost of ownership is to reduce photolithography layers, which can be achieved with EUV lithography. Chemical manufacturers are struggling to solve stochastic issues that evolve with the use of EUV lithography, as well as develop the many complementary materials required to enable the technology. Conventional filters such as Nylon and UPE (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) have been used in manufacture of photochemicals and new filtration technologies must be developed to innovate along with chemical suppliers.\nEntegris has recently developed several innovative membranes: a next generation UPE and OktolexTM. The next generation UPE overcomes the trade-off between flow rate and pore size, while also being compatible with a range of chemistries. OktolexTM selectively removes defects based on tailored membrane modification technology, further addressing defect sources that come from newly formulated chemistries.\nIn this paper, these innovative technologies are introduced to address the challenges of advanced photoresist defectivity by enhancing filtration performance. Results and possible mechanisms of defect reduction will be discussed.", "Nanoscale patterning defects continue to challenge yield performance of photolithographic processes. It is well known that applying point-of-use (POU) filtration to patterning chemistries is effective for defect reduction. While POU filtration can remove contaminants from process chemistries, the filter materials of construction could adversely interact with the chemistry, resulting in a long filter flushing time or poor lithographic performance. Historically, the most common materials used to manufacture filters for POU photochemical filtration are ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UPE) and Nylon. UPE membranes have outstanding chemical compatibility and enable sub-5 nm filtration, but can struggle to quickly reach baseline defectivity when trying to remove air from the smallest available pores. Nylon membranes provide additional non-sieving retention capabilities that can be instrumental in reducing wafer level defects without further reducing membrane pore size, but are not compatible with acidic chemistries.\nTo address the demand for new chemistry compatibility, reduced defectivity and increased productivity, Entegris has tailored a membrane as part of its OktolexTM family of technologies to address demanding lithography defectivity performance targets. The new membrane is cleaner, more retentive, and has an enhanced non-sieving particle capture capability when compared to a standard Nylon membranes. In an evaluation of the newly developed membrane using 45nm line/space patterning, the new membrane significantly outperformed both UPE and Nylon filters in microbridging defectivity. In addition, the new membrane also achieved baseline significantly faster than the other filters.", "In recent years, we have seen growing numbers of reports on problems associated with outgas generated from resists during ArF exposure, including contaminating of the exposure equipment lens. Scanner manufacturers have apparently begun taking countermeasures\u2014for example, establishing criteria for outgas generated by resists during exposure. In the near future, resist manufacturers will likely be required to attach documents regarding outgassing to their products at the time of shipment. In our earlier studies, we tried to establish methods for evaluating outgassing from KrF resists during KrF (248 nm) exposure. This paper examines an approach to evaluating outgassing from ArF chemically-amplified resists during ArF exposure, with a special focus on sulfate ions (SO42-) derived from PAG, based on the outgas analytical techniques that we have built up to date. We used ion chromatography (IC) as the method of analysis.", "Miniaturization of lithographic feature sizes via shrink technologies is under development in order to extend 193nm immersion lithographic capabilities and achieve sub-20nm critical dimensions (CD) in integrated circuit manufacturing before extreme ultraviolet lithography comes online. It was found that precisely controlled polymers comprising a grafting unit and a shrink unit are capable of reducing pattern dimensions formed in negative tone development (NTD) photoresists. Fundamental studies were pursued regarding the type of grafting chemistry, the shrink monomer and polymer backbone choice, and differences between polymer architectures. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that shrink amount could be tuned by choice of monomer, polymer molecular weight, and choice of grafting unit. These studies permitted the development of several generations of grafting polymer platforms to meet a range of desired CD shrink targets from less than 10nm shrink to 30nm shrink on contact hole or line/space patterns. The shrink technology further exhibits improved process window compared to optical lithography at the same CD and low defectivity, highlighting the use of this technology in advanced semiconductor processing nodes.", "Conventional doping of crystalline Si via ion implantation results in a stochastic distribution of doped regions in the x-y plane along with relatively poor control over penetration depth of dopant atoms. As the gate dimensions get to 10 nm, the related device parameters also need to be scaled down to maintain electrical activity. Thus highly doped abrupt, ultra-shallow junctions are imperative for source-drain contacts to realize sub-10 nm transistors. Uniform ultra-shallow junctions can be achieved via monolayer doping, wherein thermal diffusion of a self-limiting monolayer of dopant atomcontaining organic on Si surface yields sub-5 nm junctions. We have extended the use of organic dopant molecules in the monolayer doping technique to introduce a new class of spin-on polymer dopants. In effect, these new spin-on dopants offer a hybrid between the monolayer doping technique and traditional inorganic spin-on dopants. We have been able to uniformly introduce p- and n-type dopants with doping efficiencies comparable to the monolayer doping technique. Control over junction depth can be easily achieved via optimizing annealing temperature and time. Concurrently, sequestering the dopant precursors within the cores of block copolymer micelles allows us to achieve precise control over the spatial positions of dopant atoms in all three dimensions owing to the high periodicity of block copolymer domains on the 10-100 nm length scale.", "We had developed various Polyphenols and Xanthene derivatives such as NF7177C and NF0197 which showed high heat resistance.\nIn this paper, we reported on new mareimide derivatives named \u201cNeoFARIT N0XX (NFN0XX)\u201d series which showed the highest heat resistance of our SOC materials [1].\nTo increase heat resistance drastically, we focused on Polyimides\u2019s structure. Generally speaking, polyimide resin shows the highest heat resistance in typical polymer. Introducing maleimide structure also resulted in increasing heat resistance of SOC materials drastically. For example, NeoFARIT N0XX\u201d series show very slight weight loss to 400\u00b0C. Although the weight loss of NF0197, which showed the highest heat resistance in our phenol materials, was 4.7% at 400\u00b0C in the air in TG-DTA analysis, those of NFN001 and NFN005 were less than 1% in the same condition. Moreover, the weight loss of NFN001, NFN005 and NFN006 at 450\u00b0C in the air was less than 5%. While these materials showed highlighted heat resistance, they showed poor solubility in PGME and PGMEA. Then, we tried to improve the solubility of NFN0XX and developed NFN009 and NFN010 whose solubility in PGMEA was 30%. NFN009 showed not only good solubility in PGMEA but also high heat resistance comparable to NFN001, NFN005 and NFN006.\nWe also try to improve the heat resistance of NFN0XX and developed NFN011 and its cured film showed slight shrinkage at 450\u00b0C bake.", "New spin-on silicon hard mask (Si-HM) material containing Si-C structure in main chain was developed to meet EUV lithography performance, etch requirements and non-lithography patterning applications at sub 5 nm node. New Si-HM material can be used as an alternative to traditional polysiloxane Si-HM. It showed 2.5X high resistance for oxygen etching compared to polysiloxane Si-HM structure due to low electronegative gap and higher silicon content. It can be chemically modified with various functional units, and photoresist adhesion control would be expected to improve. We also observed sensitivity improvement from EUV lithography tri-layer patterning process including new Si-HM. Wet strip-ability with DHF and refractive index at 193 nm were changed significantly for this new Si-HM before and after UV irradiation under air. It also showed excellent gap-fill performance at narrow pattern dimensions on our patterned wafers.", "Relentless semiconductor device scaling relies on lithography technology advancement. Patterning films including hardmask, anti-reflective coating (ARC) and photoresist (PR) materials continue to evolve, and more underlying materials are exposed in increasingly complex 3D device structures. As a result, industry is continuously seeking solutions to integrate new patterning films with different underlying materials and structures, and surface treatment for materials protection plays an increasingly important role in process integration. In this paper, we present a radical based surface methylation process. The novel surface methylation treatment process increases surface wetting angle in preparation of patterning film coating, and can effectively protect various sensitive underlying materials. The versatile technology has many potential applications in 3D device fabrication, e.g. a new adhesion promoter for ARC/PR coating.", "Electronic beam lithography (EBL) is commonly used for patterning at the nanoscale by way of a focused electron beam. This process can lead to charge accumulation on the surface of the resist when used in conjunction with non-conductive substrate materials, impacting lithographic quality producing egregious shape placement inaccuracies. Current practice requires the use of a deposited metal or conductive polymer film to facilitate charge dissipation at the surface. Such films are often unstable, incompatible and/or can be difficult to remove after exposure. This paper presents the findings of a study of a novel aqueous based quaternary ammonium compound for use in EBL for charge dissipation on non-conductive substrates. This compound was found to effectively prevent charge accumulations across a broad range of resist materials while remaining highly stable at room temperature and easily removed with deionized water or isopropanol after EBL exposure.", "Deep learning has recently been successfully applied to lithography hotspot detection. However, automatic correction of the detected hotspots into non-hotspots has not been explored. This problem is challenging because the standard supervised learning requires a training dataset with pairs of hotspots and non-hotspots, which is impractical to collect because lithography hotspots involve diverse and complicated lithographic pattern properties. In this paper, we propose a new framework for lithography hotspot correction with a deep generative network combined with a learning strategy optimized for lithography patterns. Our key idea is to learn to translate hotspots to non-hotspots and vice versa, simultaneously. In this way, the training dataset does not have to be paired, and hotspot patterns in variety of background can be learned. Our method does not require the understanding of the cause of hotspots and can correct hotspots that are difficult to recognize by conventional approaches. For evaluation, we propose to synthesize a training dataset that reflects a variety of real-world lithography patterns. Experimental results show that our framework can correct hotspot images with comparable quality as a conventional complicated process, while significantly reducing the overall processing time.", "Etch process is critical to CD control in patterning, but Etch-aware OPC is not as accurate as lithographyaware OPC. Etch process is not understood very well compared to lithography, so empirical etch model like Variable Etch Bias (VEB) has been used for OPC. Although VEB has been quite successful so far, accuracy of etch model needs be improved with below 10 nm node devices. Machine Learning (ML) is applied in this work for VEB model improvement. However, ML is also an extreme empirical model, in fact, so over-fitting is a big problem with machine learning. We demonstrate over-fitting as well as accuracy can be improved in this work as presenting specific methods of ML such as double-stage machine learning, etch-relevant inputs and ensuring sample-coverage.", "Model-based optical proximity correction (MPOPC) has been well adopted in subwavelength lithography for integrated-circuit manufacturing. Typical MBOPC algorithms involve with iteratively moving the layout polygon edges to reduce the edge placement errors (EPEs) predicted by the lithography model. At each iteration, the amounts of movement are mainly determined by the values of the EPEs and the correction factors (CFs). Since full-chip lithography simulation is very computation intensive, it is highly desirable to minimize the number of iterations for acceptable run times, by selecting suitable CFs. In practical applications, the CFs are usually heuristically determined and applied globally throughout the correction regions. This approach efficiently reduces the EPEs at most of the target points but the entire convergence can be hampered at a relatively small number of hot-spot locations. This work investigates the effectiveness of improving the overall convergence by introducing both global and local CFs, and approaches to utilize machine-learning techniques to estimate the hot-spot locations and associated local CF values.", "As technology continues to scale aggressively, Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAF) are becoming an increasingly key resolution enhancement technique (RET) to maximize the process window enhancement. For the past few technology generations, lithographers have chosen to use a rules-based (RB-SRAF) or a model-based (MB-SRAF) approach to place assist features on the design. The inverse lithography solution, which provides the maximum process window entitlement, has always been out of reach for full-chip applications due to its very high computational cost. ASML has developed and demonstrated a deep learning SRAF placement methodology, Newron\u2122 SRAF, which can provide the performance benefit of an inverse lithography solution while meeting the cycle time requirements for full-chip applications [1]. One of the biggest challenges for a deep learning approach is pattern selection for neural network training. To ensure pattern coverage for maximum accuracy while maintaining turn-around time (TAT,) a deep-learning-based Auto Pattern Selection (APS) tool is evaluated. APS works in conjunction with Newron SRAF to provide the optimal lithography solution. In this paper, Newron SRAF is used on a DRAM layer. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is trained using the target images and Continuous Transmission Mask (CTM) images. CTM images are gray tone images that are fully optimized by the Tachyon inverse mask optimization engine. Representative patterns selected by APS are used to train the neural network. The trained neural network generates SRAFs on the full-chip and then Tachyon OPC+ is performed to correct main and SRAF simultaneously. The neural network trained by APS patterns is compared with those trained by patterns from manual selection and multiple random selections to demonstrate its robustness on pattern coverage. Tachyon Hierarchical OPC+ (HScan+) is used to apply Newron SRAF at full-chip level in order to keep consistency and increase speed. Full-chip simulation results from Newron SRAF are compared with the baseline OPC flow using RBSRAF and MB-SRAF. The Newron SRAF flow shows significant improvements in NILS and PV band over the baseline flows. This whole flow including APS, Newron SRAF and full-chip HScan+ OPC enables the inverse mask optimization on full-chip level to achieve superior mask performance with production-affordable TAT.", "For the past several years there has been a push in the industry to drive innovation by pairing different types of metrology to keep up with the challenging requirements of overlay, focus and CD in multi-patterning processes. Holistic metrology is an example of this where instead of using a single metrology method we pair various available metrology methods to enrich the overall information content. With advancements in deep learning algorithms we can better utilize existing infrastructure to extract information from metrology parings for a cost-effective solution that has traditionally gone unused. In computational alignment metrology we pair leveling data with alignment and wafer quality to generate a dense alignment vector map. In the first step wafer leveling metrology from the lithographic apparatus is deconvolved into individual contributors. Selecting the deconvolved signatures with greatest influence on alignment metrology we train our dense input metrology to our targeted alignment metrology using a deep feedforward network. With the trained weights and biases of the deep feedforward network and input from a new lot of wafers we can now compute a dense alignment vector map. With a 3rd order HOWA model fit to the original 32 marks and then again to the same 32 marks paired with leveling, the model fit to the dense estimation from the 32 marks paired with leveling out performs HOWA fit to the original 32 marks. Finally, by fitting an advanced alignment model which optimizes spatial frequency between our enhanced alignment and corresponding overlay metrology, we can realize additional performance improvements in wafer to wafer overlay.", "To support the manufacturing of DRAM semiconductors for next and future nodes, there is a constant need to reduce the overlay fingerprints. In this paper we evaluate algorithms which are capable of decoupling wafer deformation from mark deformation and extrapolation effects. The algorithms enable lithography tools to use only the wafer deformation component in the alignment feedforward correction. Therefore improving the (wafer to wafer) overlay. First results will be shared showing improvement of wafer to wafer variation in high-volume manufacturing environment.", "Layout features become highly susceptible to lithography process fluctuations due to the widening subwavelength lithography gap. Problematic layout patterns incur poor printability even if they pass design rule checking. These hotspots should be detected and removed at early design phases to improve manufacturability. While existing studies mainly focus on hotspot detection and pattern classification, hotspot pattern library generation is rarely addressed in literature but crucial to the effectiveness and efficiency of hotspot detection. For an advanced process, in addition to yield-limiting patterns inherent from old processes and computation intensive lithography simulation, defect silicon images (SEM images) inspected from test wafers provide more realistic process-dependent hotspots. For facilitating hotspot pattern library generation, we raise a pattern matching problem of searching design layout patterns that may induce problematic SEM images. The key challenge is the various shape distortions between an SEM image and corresponding design layouts. Directly matching either feature points or shapes of both is thus not applicable. We observe that even with shape distortions, matched design layouts and the SEM image have similar density distribution. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient multilevel pixilation framework to seek layout clips with similar density distribution from coarse- to finegranularities to an SEM image. The proposed framework possesses high parallelism. Our results show that the proposed method can effectively and efficiently identify matched layout pattern candidates.", "Modern photoresists shrink during exposure and post-exposure bake processes. The shrinkage is of an elastic nature, occurring below the glass transition temperatures when material does not flow. This elasticity problem is usually modeled numerically using finite element method. Here this problem is solved analytically for a one-, two-, and three- dimensional distribution of displacements. Exact analytical solutions in the form of Fourier series by the lateral film coordinates were found. The film shape and lateral displacements after shrinking are found to be convolutions on the distribution of voids that are formed after evaporation of volatile chemicals. Convolution is a fast numerical algorithm easily incorporated into compact process models for optical proximity correction and applied to the full chip processing. Photoresist shrinking effects are analyzed using this apparatus for modern bright and dark tone processes.", "Chemically amplified resists undergo various chemical phenomena during the photolithography process such as exposure, post-exposure bake (PEB), and development. These chemical changes induce various stresses causing the deformation of exposed region of photoresist. It is imperative to include these deformations in the modeling of lithographic processes especially for negative tone development (NTD) process, where an exposed and deformed part of the resist stays on the substrate after development. We use rigorous physical model to express the stresses induced by voids created in resist by evaporation of the protecting species. Finite Element method (FEM) is then used to solve three-dimensional elastic deformation equations for resist during PEB and development. The deformation of resist is studied for both one-dimensional gratings and two-dimensional contact holes with varying pitch and optical doses, and we discuss how different modes of deformation are important to be considered in the lithography simulations in order to reduce the critical dimensions\u2019 (CD) computation error. Finally, we briefly introduce a compact model where Fourier series are used to find the exact analytical solution of elastic deformation equations. The results of compact model are compared with the rigorous FEM solution. The compact model is suitable for full chip lithography simulations due to it being numerically fast operations and results comparable to full-physics rigorous simulations.", "In recent years, compact modeling of negative tone development (NTD) resists has been extensively investigated. Specific terms have been developed to address typical NTD effects, such as aerial image intensity dependent resist shrinkage and development loading. The use of photo decomposable quencher (PDQ) in NTD resists, however, brings extra challenges arising from more complicated and mixed resist effect. Due to pronounced effect of photoacid and base diffusion, the NTD resist with PDQ may exhibit opposite iso-dense bias trend compared with normal NTD resist. In this paper, we present detailed analysis of physical effects in NTD resist with PDQ, and describe respective terms to address each effect. To decouple different effects and evaluate the impact of individual terms, we identify a certain group of patterns that are most sensitive to specific resist effect, and investigate the corresponding term response. The results indicate that all the major resist effect, including PDQ-enhanced acid/base diffusion, NTD resist shrinkage and NTD development loading can be well captured by relevant terms. Based on these results, a holistic approach for the compact model calibration of NTD resist with PDQ can be established.", "Due to the semiconductor industry\u2019s ever increasing need for finer resolution and improved critical dimension (CD) control, negative tone development (NTD) photoresists (resists) have been adopted for several advanced applications in lithographic patterning. NTD resists enable brightfield imaging by using an organic solvent developer to penetrate and remove the unexposed regions of the resist [1]. For certain critical patterning layers, such as metal trenches and vias, NTD resists are able to provide better resist imaging quality compared to the previous positive tone development (PTD) resist process. However, there are several additional engineering difficulties which must be addressed for an NTD resist process. Specifically, NTD resists have low contrast organic solvent development and in an NTD process the material remaining on the wafer substrate is exposed resist which has been substantially transformed both chemically and mechanically. Therefore, the remaining exposed resist shows significantly more complex physical behavior than the remaining PTD resist and these behaviors require substantial improvement in an OPC (compact) model\u2019s physical modeling accuracy in order to match wafer data and trends [2,3]. Additionally, these more complex resist behaviors place further requirements on the physical validation of OPC modeling inference. In this paper, we present results of our work to understand and improve the optimization and physical validation of physics-based NTD compact modeling flows by utilizing new methods for analysis and automation. We utilize a complete compact model flow containing physics-based resist model forms for chemically amplified resist (CAR) exposure, CAR reaction-diffusion, resist top-loss due to exposure combined with post-exposure bake (PEB), low contrast organic solvent development of resist, and mechanical deformation effects in multiple process steps. We present solid evidence that this physically-based flow has been validated for accuracy and predictability by comparing it to several experimental NTD datasets and to results of rigorous 3D lithography simulation models which were trained to fit other experimental NTD data. We additionally compared key physics-based model forms from the compact model to the more complex full time-based moving surface NTD models of the rigorous 3D simulation. We next analyzed the key physics-based compact model forms for sensitivity to input testpattern type, layout and mask dimension (e.g., linearity and MEEF), traditional dose-focus variations, as well as systematic and random noise in CD metrology. We present the results of this study and make recommendations for minimum testpattern and overall process space data to include in NTD compact model datasets. We also present flow benefits obtained from automating different validation tests including the usefulness of employing rigorous lithography simulation NTD results early in the compact modeling flow to improve overall model quality.

Understanding dissolution behavior of 193-nm photoresists in organic solvent developers.", "A variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE) is an essential tool for measuring the thickness of a thin film, as well as its n and k optical parameters. However, for films thinner than 10 nm, precise measurement is very challenging. In this paper, the root causes of these measurement complexities are discussed, and a new approach is proposed to improve measurement accuracy and reliability as the VASE approaches its fundamental limits, that is, the limitations of the system\u2019s mechanical accuracy and optical coherence. Specifically, twelve different polymer thin films were tested, each with 16 test points. The measured thicknesses (ranging from 3 nm to 19 nm) and n- and k-values strongly depended on test settings and on the data fitting algorithm, incident angle, and wavelength selection. Fitting using equal thickness and n-value of multiple test points was applied as additional criteria to evaluate the consistency of the test results. With this technique, reasonable n-values and thickness values were obtained from films that were as thin as 3 nm. To improve the efficiency of the model fitting, film thickness and n-value are associated to allow these two-dimensional parameters to be fitted into a quasi-one-dimensional model, which reduces central processing unit (CPU) utilization.", "In this paper, Canon will report on our most advanced 300 mm i-line stepper, the FPA-5550iZ2. Steppers enjoy an inherent productivity advantage, and Canon has developed solutions that overcome stepper disadvantages to realize an exposure tool with high overlay accuracy and excellent productivity. We will review Canon\u2019s 300 mm i-line steppers evolutions that started in 2001 when our first 300 mm i-line stepper provided only 84 wafer per hour (wph) throughput. In 2018, our latest FPA5550iZ2 has evolved to realize more than 250wph for productivity while maintaining the same base design and almost same footprint. This paper will report the technologies that improve productivity and introduce current and underdevelopment functions that can enhance customer processes.", "All chipmakers understand that variability is the adversary of any process and reduction is essential to improving yield which translates to profit. Aggressive process window and yield specifications necessitate tight inline variation requirements on the DUV light source which impact scanner imaging performance. Improvements in reducing bandwidth variation have been realized with DynaPulse\u2122 bandwidth control technology as significant reduction in bandwidth variation translates to a reduction in CD variation for critical device structures. Previous work on a NAND Via layer has demonstrated an improvement in process capability through improve source and mask optimization with greater ILS and reduced MEEF that improved CDU by 25%. Using this Via layer, we have developed a methodology to quantify the contribution in an overall CDU budget breakdown. Data from the light source is collected using SmartPulse\u2122 allowing for the development of additional methodologies using predictive models to quantify CD variation from Cymer\u2019s legacy, DynaPulse 1 and DynaPulse 2 bandwidth control technologies. CD non-uniformities due to laser bandwidth variation for lot to lot, wafer to wafer, field to field and within field is now available based on known sensitivities and modeled. This data can assist in understanding the contribution from laser bandwidth variation in global and local CDU budgets.", "Multi-patterning lithography for future technology nodes in logic and memory are driving the allowed on-product overlay error in an DUV and EUV matched machine operation down to values of 2 nm and below. The ASML ORION alignment sensor provides an effective way to deal with process impact on alignment marks. In addition, optimized higher order wafer alignment models combined with overlay metrology based feedforward correction schemes are deployed to control the process induced overlay variability from wafer-to-wafer and lot-to-lot. In addition machine learning based algorithms based on hybrid metrology inputs, strengthen the control capabilities for high volume manufacturing. The increase of the number of process layers in semiconductor devices results in an increase of control complexity of the total overlay and alignment control strategy. This complexity requires a holistic solution approach, that addresses total overlay optimization from process design, to process setup, and process control in high volume manufacturing. We find the optimum combination between feedforward and feedback, by having feedback deal with constant and predictable parts of overlay and have scanner wafer alignment covering the wafer-to-wafer variable part of overlay. In this paper we present investigation results using more wavelengths for wafer alignment and show the benefits in wavelength selection and recipe optimization. We investigate the wafer-to-wafer variable content of two experiment cases and show that a sample scheme of about 60 marks is well capable estimating the model parameters describing the grid. Finally, we show initial results of using level sensor metrology data as hybrid input to the derivation of the exposure grid.", "Latest ArF immersion lithography has been positioned as the promising technology to meet tighter process control requirements with providing highly efficient productivity, simultaneously. The most important features for the next generation lightsources are the improvement of chip yield and tool availability in manufacturing. One of the key requirements for lightsource is E95% bandwidth, which has become more critical parameter for enhancing process margin and improving optical characteristic. Lower E95% bandwidth enables to increase imaging contrast which demonstrates better OPE characteristic with better resolution as well as improved E95% bandwidth stability that providing CD uniformity on wafer. A newly designed line narrowing module (LNM) enables to lower E95% bandwidth from the standard 300fm to 200fm. The large shrinkage for E95% bandwidth is achieved by the sophisticated design in LNM which enables to lower thermal wave front aberration reducing heat effect at optical elements and mechanical components during lasing the lights. Lower E95% bandwidth reduces a focus blur in the formulated image that is generated from the chromatic aberration with projection lenses in ArF immersion lithography system. In the other hand, it is essential to improve the productivity by means of reducing downtime, the lifetime of consumable modules such as a chamber and a line narrowing module (LNM) is needed to be extended. New electrodes as called \u201cRAIKIRI\u201d electrode with chamber enable lifetime extension from 60 billion pulses (Bpls) to 80 Bpls. Furthermore, new optical design in LNM enables the lifetime to extend from 60 Bpls to 110 Bpls. Hence, the GT65A, maximizes device yield, process productivity therefore provides optimum in the operational costs for chipmakers. In the presentation, the latest development status and performances on GT65A will be discussed.", "We have developed an automatic lens control and parameter settings scheme (on-product iLC) for thermal aberration predictive (feedforward) and calibration (feedback) control. Thermal aberration control is essential for critical layers, and lens control parameter setup time reduction is imperative in maximizing scanner uptime. In our experiment, during production lot exposure the new scheme automatically corrected lens control parameters to within sufficient imaging accuracy tolerances, and demonstrated a dramatic reduction in layer setup time compared with the conventional approach, and we will discuss an actual use-case in this paper.", "The semiconductor manufacturing roadmap which generally follows Moore\u2019s law requires smaller and smaller EPE (Edge Placement Error), and this places stricter requirements on OPC model accuracy, which is mainly limited by metrology errors, pattern coverage and model form. Current metrology errors are mainly related to SEM image noise and measurement difficulty in complex 2D patterns. And traditional model form improvement by adding empirical terms for PEB (Post Exposure Bake), NTD (Negative Tone Development) and PRS (Physical Resist Shrinkage) effects still cannot meet the accuracy spec because other physical and chemical effects are uncaptured. Fitting these effects also requires comprehensive pattern coverage during model calibration. Solely improving model form may overfit the metrology error, which is risky, while solely improving metrology ignores existing model errors: both factors are troublesome for OPC. In this paper, a new metrology (MXP, naming for Metrology of Extreme Performance) and deep learning (Newron, naming for a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model form) integrated solution is proposed, where MXP decreases the metrology errors and provides good pattern coverage with high-volume reliable CD and EP (Edge Placement) gauges, and Newron captures remaining complex physical and chemical effects embedded in high-volume gauges beyond the traditional model. This solution shows overall ~30% prediction accuracy improvement compared to baseline metrology and FEM+ (Focus Exposure Matrix) model flow in N14 NTD process, predicts SEM shape of critical weak points more accurately.", "With semiconductor technology progressing beyond 5nm node, there is tremendous pressure on computational lithography to achieve both accuracy and speed. One very promising technique to accomplish this mission is to take full advantage of the maturing machine learning techniques based on neural network architecture. Some success has been achieved using convolution neural network (CNN) to obtain inverse lithography technology (ILT) solution with significantly less computational time. In general, CNN architecture consists of feature extraction layers and nonlinear mapping function construction layers. To train a CNN model requires a large amount of data and computational resource. To maintain certain intrinsic symmetries of imaging behavior, the feature extraction layers must be carefully engineered using weight sharing techniques or using well balanced training samples of different orientations, otherwise, feature extraction part will be skewed. It is therefore very desired to have a scheme that can obtain optimal feature vector for machine learning based computational lithography automatically without the need of feature extraction layers in CNN. In this paper, we will make an attempt to describe such a scheme and present our test results on machine learning based OPC and ILT solution. It should be understood that machine learning based computational lithography solutions do not possess the capability to replace conventional OPC or ILT completely due to its lack of required accuracy. However, it can provide an initial solution that is close enough to final OPC solution or ILT solution, therefore fast OPC and fast ILT can be realized.", "The placement and size of SRAF (sub-resolution assisted feature) can greatly affect the overlapped process window. The time-consuming inverse lithography technology (ILT) can provide the co-optimization for both main pattern and SRAFs, which can guarantee the results with high precision. Rule-based SRAF (RBSRAF) offers the efficient application in large scale layout, which relies mostly on the design of test patterns and the corresponding empirical data on wafer. Our paper demonstrates a methodology of SRAF rule extraction and insertion based on ILT. The SRAF rules are extracted from the results of ILT and inserted by the RBSRAF, which ensures the reliability of the SRAF rules and shortens the development cycle. The hotspots areas with substandard process variation (PV) band are then repaired by ILT tools. Besides, the SRAF printing model can further refine the placement and dimension. The experiment results validate the feasibility of our methodology to be applied in large scale layout finally.", "An efficient lithographic source and mask optimization approach is developed based on localized level set methods, which is reformulated as an inverse problem by tracking the evolution of level-set functions (LSFs) embedding the level-set representation of source and mask patterns. A distance regularized level-set (DRLS) term is incorporated into the level-set formulation enabling not only stable LSF evolution and accurate computation by maintaining a signed-distance property, but also a simple and efficient narrow-band implementation. Consequently, optimization dimensionality is significantly reduced by updating the pixels in the vicinity of zero level set (narrow band) instead of all the level sets, effectively reducing computation complexity, resulting in significantly improvements in pattern fidelity convergence in terms of runtime, computation load, Euler time step and caching memory requirement which are merited by numerical simulations.", "For deep sub-wavelength lithography, loss of wafer fidelity, such as line end shortening and corner rounding, is a known patterning phenomenon due to the diffraction limitation of the optical systems and some other processing effects. Without properly correcting these effects, particularly for gate corner rounding at the active area, sometime device performance might be limited or wafer yield will be impacted. It is addressable to improve the feature fidelity by OPC (Optical proximity correction) methodology, which is intentionally to offset the light distortion while in mask synthesis process. However, it is most likely becoming better, but not be completely solved at all. In this paper, first, the acceptable gate corner rounding criteria is examined. From the design rule constraint for gate region and test key electrical performance result, primary geometrical specification is determined. At the same time, considering inline process variation, such as ADI CD/overlay variation and loading effect of etching process, then the OPC corner rounding target specification comes accordingly. Second, OPC countermeasure for gate corner rounding improvement is studied. Usually gate CD uniformity is increased near the corner region, that is, gate poly CD is larger than expectation at the beginning of the active area near the L-shape or U-shape poly pattern. Since the transistor performance will be degraded, the improvement for corner rounding is important for OPC development. Aggressive OPC recipe to manipulate the polygon is required. We make use of localized fragmentation rule as well as specific retargeting to eliminate the impact of corner rounding effect in optical system. This methodology for corner fidelity improvement was proved by the wafer result.", "To achieve the smallest line width of IC requires the spherical and coma aberration free lithography optics. Once the aberration of lens is formed, it is hard to amend the mask to original requirement, unless the light pattern figure is adjustable. A programmable UVLED array with a collimated lens as Fourier transfer lens forms an adjustable pattern as the intensity profile to amend the aberration of mask to form aberration free mask intensity pattern into wafer. A 25 X 25 UVLED array with collimated lens is applied to correct the aberration contained mask, is to form a corrected pattern under the requirement for reducing aberration mask to form a smallest line width.", "As critical dimension shrinks, the image quality of lithographic projection lens is improved gradually. In lithographic tool, vibration is an important factor affecting the image quality of projection lens. The internal vibration of projection lens will change the relative position between the lens elements, reduce the image contrast and process window. There are usually two methods to suppress the internal vibration of lithographic projection lens, isolating the external vibration source and improving the stiffness of the internal structure. Based on the above methods, this paper proposes a dynamic imaging model (DIM) that establishes a precise quantitative relationship between the internal vibration of projection lens and the imaging contrast. The DIM has been used in image performance analysis and the structure design for lithographic projection lens.", "In recent years, applications of semiconductor demands have been steadily growing, including automobiles to finance, medicine, agriculture, etc., and the needs for productivity improvement amongst semiconductor manufacturers is higher than ever. To resolve this situation, in the last few years, Gigaphoton developed emerging technologies on light source, to extend the module replacement interval and reduce the maintenance time by state-of-the-art technology into cutting edge lithography operation. In order to access highly effective and utilize productivity, it is required quantitative and predictive approach before service event execution, Gigaphoton also developed a software function named as Availability MAXimization (here after \u201cAMAX\u201d). Currently in light sources, PM (Periodical Maintenance, here after \u201cPM\u201d) schedule bases per chipmaker input concerning wafer production, which is schedule bases PM execution. Gigaphoton allows providing the solutions with chipmakers best scenario in terms of both schedule bases and availability maximization. Simultaneously therefore, chipmaker should gain the efficiency of productivity enhancement through Gigaphoton AMAX solution, as well as module lifetime extension.", "Multi-patterning techniques with ArF immersion lithography is expected to continue as main solution for manufacturing IC chips. The reduction of laser downtime has great impact on the productivity of chipmakers. The laser downtime is closely related to the lifetime of consumable parts of the laser. Gigaphoton has developed longer life excimer laser chamber which contains a new technology \u201cNew-type G-electrode\u201d. This new type excimer laser chamber demonstrated 1.3 times longer lifetime than conventional excimer laser chamber. Gigaphoton has also introduced new design of LNM (Line Narrowing Module) last year. Through combines timing of maintenance of new type excimer laser chamber and new type LNM, it\u2019s expected that the downtime of the laser is significantly reduced than ever. This leads to the improvement of the throughput on ArFi lithography.", "In advanced DRAM fabrication, wafer alignment is a key enabler to meet on-product overlay performance requirement. Due to the extreme complexity of patterning and integration process involved, it\u2019s becoming a challenge to design alignment marks that can be patterned robustly through process window, meet process integration constraints, withstand large process variation or changes, and provide accurate alignment measurement, during early development. The unique tilted pattern in DRAM fabrication technology poses special challenges during both design and process phase. In this paper, we present a holistic computational approach to design robust alignment marks with ASML\u2019s integrated Design for Control (D4C) and OPC solutions. With this integrated solution, we design a complex set of alignment marks for the entire full flow process from FEOL through BEOL, tailored by each stack of different lithography layers. In mark design stage, marks\u2019 signal and robustness are optimized by D4C simulation, taking into account the design rule and process constraints, while patterning fidelity and process window of these marks is ensured by OPC, subject to the design rule constraints. We demonstrate that the process window (PW) of the resulting alignment marks, especially for the challenging layers with extreme off-axis illuminations and tight design constraints, are significantly improved, while simultaneously accurate and robust alignment measurements are obtained on full loop wafers.", "In recent years, DUV light source used in lithography process is enabling to shrink the feature size as a driver for Moore's law, in order to push the physical limits of semiconductor device. E95, also known as spectral bandwidth, is one of the most important parameters in the semiconductor lithography process. Light source is required to push E95 to be tighter in order to improve image contrast, and also required to improve E95 control technology to contribute to OPE (Optical Proximity Effect) error reduction. Therefore, measurement accuracy is crucial important to measure spectral bandwidth. Current measurement error is 5.6 fm (femtometers) when E95 is 300 fm, under a standard spectral metrology tool as ELIAS (Echelle Based Spectrometers produced by LASERTECHNIK BERLIN GmbH). Gigaphoton's recent technology successfully reduced the E95 target value from the existing 300 fm to 200 fm by decreasing the optical thermal load for the LNM (Line-Narrowing Module) [1]. Under current measurement method, the error will be increased, when E95 is set at 200 fm. In order to resolve this problem, Gigaphoton uses a grating base spectral measurement, to reduce the error, by optical engineering improvement and high-resolution spectrum measurement. This ultra-high-resolution measurement impact to OPE error reduction.", "Problems in simulation, in physical defects, or in electrical failures of the IC devices generally occur at the boundaries of dimensional tolerances, such as the minimum width and space. However, for layout configurations with four or more critical dimensions, simple minimums are insufficient to characterize dimensional coverage. Persistent homology is a multi-resolution analysis technique which robustly summarizes dimensional coverage. We apply this technique to compare dimensional coverage of IC design configurations, on the same layer, on different layers, and on different designs, yielding results both expected and unexpected based on manufacturing process and design rule knowledge.", "Detecting and resolving the true on-wafer-hotspot (defect) is critical to improve wafers\u2019 yield in high volume manufacturing semiconductor foundries. Traditionally, Optical Rule Check (ORC) with computation lithography has been one of the most important techniques to flag potential failure patterns (weak points) after Optical Proximity Correction (OPC), where ORC results are fed back to the OPC team to fix the OPC solution if needed, or fed forward to Contamination Free Manufacturing (CFM) team to improve the inspection accuracy. However, as the integrated circuits process becomes more and more complex with the technology scaling, ORC alone could no longer identify the outlier-alike defects, even though it has helped in resolving most of defects on wafer. Failing to detect yield-killer defects could be due to the lack of sufficient understanding and modeling in terms of etching, CMP, as well as other inter-layer process variations. It has been a struggle for Fab to identify reasonable amount of defects scattered on wafer in order to understand defect mechanisms quickly, thus find ways to fix them in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a fast and accurate Defect Detection and Repair Flow (DDRF) with machine learning (ML) methodology to address the above issues. There are four parts in the DDRF: the first part is on the feature generation and data collection, the second on the ML model building, the third on the full-chip prediction, and the fourth on the hot-spot repair. We use limited amount of known defects found on wafer as input to train the ML model, and then apply the ML model to the full chip for prediction. The wafer verification data showed that our flow achieved more than 80% of defect hit rate with engineered feature extractions and ML model for a 7nm mask. Finally, we analyze the failing mechanism with more available defects, and are able to provide guidance to the OPC development to fix the defects by using the ML model.", "Layout-pattern-based approaches for physical design analysis and verification have become mainstream in recent years and are enabling many new applications. Prior work introduced the ability to collect all patterns from multiple layouts into a catalog as well as to use machine learning techniques to score and filter patterns to identify which ones are critical. In this paper, data mined from a library of scored patterns from established designs is applied to the analysis of diagnosis results from a new design to improve defect root cause analysis (RCA). The flow for this approach is as follows: patterns interacting with nets reported in diagnosis callouts are selected as patterns of interest (POIs) from the catalog of all patterns. Next, features of interest (FOIs) are extracted from all POIs to build a dataframe. Finally, volume diagnosis results identifying nets with likely open or short defects are added to the dataframe. RCA is performed using the dataframe to identify likely root cause(s) for failures and suggest refined failure locations for targeted inspection, physical failure analysis, or other electrical failure analysis. The approach described above is applied to products in high-volume manufacturing using a leading-edge technology node. Silicon validation results will be included for example applications.", "Several tools in the mask data preparation flow utilize the repetitions of patterns within a layout to reduce processing time. Conventionally, this is achieved by an analysis of the design hierarchy. However, intermediate processing in the data preparation flow can distort the hierarchy. Also, some repetitions in small-grain structures may not be represented in the hierarchy. An alternative is to learn repeating patterns and their frequency by analyzing the layout as a flat data structure. This paper demonstrates a methodology for learning the largest repeating patterns in a layout without the use of hierarchy, purely by referencing the layout as a flat data structure. The experimental results show its efficacy for layouts containing hundreds of thousands of polygons, as well as its efficiency in terms of computing time and memory usage. The results indicate that it is practical to use a distributed process to directly learn the largest repeating patterns without resorting to design hierarchy, in a reasonable runtime and memory usage.", "Critical edge placement margins continue to shrink in advanced designs, Over the years, various methods have been used to quantify the lithographic \u201cprocess window\u201d, often in terms of allowable CD variation. Ultimately however, what is of most interest is the margin for chip failure, either due to hard pinching, bridging, or pattern collapse of a single layer, or interlayer critical edge placement errors. The latter could include insufficient overlap between layers such as metal and via, or unwanted bridging of patterns between layers. We present here a framework for estimating the failure rate for any individual feature given an assumed manufacturing distribution of primary patterning variables such as dose, focus, mask dimension, and perhaps overlay. If the failure rate for all features within the die is known, then by extension the failure rate for the entire die can be known. Since estimating the process window exhaustively for all in-die locations is not possible, we first identify process window limiting features, then utilize this knowledge to estimate overall die failure rates. This method can account for both systematic failure of an individual feature instance as well as stochastic failure for repeating patterns.", "Machine learning has significant potential to help the human designer produce better outcomes. It can also help manage some of the complexity with chip design in advanced nodes. Projects to be discussed include the following. o Using Bayesian optimization for circuit IP reuse. Analog and custom digital IP reuse is difficult and time-consuming. Professor Franzon's group has built a Bayesian optimization approach involving statistical surrogate models. They have demonstrated by porting a number of designs between nodes, including a BJT to SOI port. The machine learning based approach produced better results than a human designer. o Using Surrogate modeling for Physical design. Professor Franzon's group has used a machine learning approach to predict Global Router and detailed router results as a function of tool input settings. These models can be used to tune the tool setup for specific outcomes. o Using Surrogate Modeling and System Identification Modeling to model digital receiver chains. Digital receiver modeling is predict BER of a receiver in the presence of an input signal with a close eye. Professor Franzon's group has used a combination of Surrogate Modeling and System Identification to build such a modeling capability. o Using deep networks for design rule checking. The team has demonstrated that deep networks can be used instead of Boolen checkers. There is significant potential to close the DFM and custom design productivity gaps.", "Machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied for quick optical proximity correction (OPC) processing. A key limitation of previous ML-OPC approaches lies in the fact that a layout segment is corrected while the correction result for other segments is not reflected yet. Bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) model is adopted in this paper to alleviate this problem. BRNN consists of multiple neural network instances, which are serially linked through hidden layer connections in both forward- and backward-directions. Each instance corresponds to one layout segment, so BRNN processing corrects a group of nearby segments together. Two key problems are identified and addressed: mapping between layout segments and neural network instances, and network input features. In experiments, BRNN-OPC achieves 3.9nm average EPE for test M1 layout, which can be compared to 6.7nm average EPE from state-of-the-art ML-OPC method.", "As feature resolution and process variations continue to shrink for new nodes of both DUV and EUV lithography, the density and number of devices on advanced semiconductor masks continue to increase rapidly. These advances cause significantly increased pressure on the accuracy and efficiency of OPC and assist feature (AF) optimization methods for each subsequent process technology. Several publications and industry presentations have discussed the use of neural networks or other machine learning (or even deep learning) to provide improvements in efficiency for OPC main feature optimization or AF placement. However, these two mask synthesis steps are not independent. OPC affects AF optimum position and size; and AF position and size both affect the final optimum OPC main feature correction. A challenging example of these interactions is the need for OPC and AF methods to be aware of potential AF wafer printing. AF printing on the wafer can lead to catastrophic device failure. If an AF is at risk of printing in photoresist, both the OPC and the size (and potentially the position) of the AF need to be modified accurately and efficiently. Recent advancements in lithography utilizing negative tone develop (NTD) photoresists (resists) with strong physical shrink effects also further increase the difficulty of accurately modeling AF printing. In this paper, we present results of our work to explore the requirements, the issues and the overall potential for developing robust, accurate and fast integrated machine learning methods to optimize OPC and AFs.", "We show how combining machine learning with physical models can improve the overall accuracy of modeling the lithographic process for OPC applications by up to 40%. This level of model accuracy improvement is critical to meet the stringent requirements of the 5nm node and below. We demonstrate how the judicious design of the neural network can create a model capable of high accuracy and high contour quality, even when no contour data is available. This allows the neural network model to be introduced without disrupting the model calibration flow used in OPC.", "A suite of DFM enablement is enhanced to address the unique needs of analog, RF, and mmWave designs in the custom design flow. The DFM rules and patterns are made stricter beyond baseline requirements, and new DFM rules and patterns are added to further reduce layout-dependent device variability. Auto-fixing in the custom design flow is enhanced to meet these new requirements. New DFM enablement is developed for device matching for differential circuits and sensitive devices. Lastly, novel DFM fill strategies are implemented to reduce the variability of passive devices operating at high frequencies. Using DFM-aware fill, a 2% quality-factor loss for a mmWave inductor operating at 30 GHz is shown to be sufficient for meeting manufacturing planarity requirements.", "There has been a significant increase of optical applications in the last decade, either embedded into complex multifunction devices such as smartphones, or for imaging purpose as cameras. Core of such optical systems are microlens arrays, used for light gathering or light emitting. The most commonly used manufacturing method by the industry is the thermal reflow of photoresist polymer. The method consists in melting previously patterned photoresist dots in order to form the lenses. But the resist shaping into a microlens is not as straight forward, since the final microlens needs to match shaping criteria to maximize the device optical efficiency. The optimization of the microlens 3D shape is thus an empiric and iterative work, where several lithography and reflow process variations are explored. Photomask reorder might also be needed in order to finally reach the final targeted microlens. All of this results in a costly and time consuming process tuning work. A low cost alternative option to overcome this practical issue and make the overall microlens optimization process easier would be to have at disposal a resist reflow simulation tool, which could predict the photoresist shaping evolution through melt and cure steps. This would help designers and lithographer to evaluate beforehand the final shape of a certain design at the end of the process flow. It would then offer the possibility to identify from the start the correct design to embed onto the photomask guaranteeing the fabrication of the desired microlens. A 3D compatible and computation efficient reflow simulation software is proposed in this paper, in line with a Design Process Technology Co-optimization (DTCO) approach. It allows the fast 3D reflow simulations of hundreds of different resist patterns, taking as input a CAD design and returning the corresponding 3D microlens that will be formed. The purpose of this paper is to present the developed reflow modeling software solution and its calibration methodology. The use of the proposed alternative simulation flow for microlens optimization in a Resolution Enhancement Technics (RET) environment will also be described.", "In subwavelength lithography, the printed patterns on the silicon wafer suffer from geometric distortions and different from the original design. These non-rectangular patterns can affect electrical characteristics and circuit performances seriously. In this work, we extend the verification of location-dependent weighting method and further propose three single conventional equivalent gate length (EGL) extraction methods for representing each non-rectangular gate transistor with a single EGL model. These methods are applied to sub-20nm FDSOI circuits to predict the postlithography performances. An in-house Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) simulation tool is utilized for nonrectangular pattern simulation. Shape information is imported to TCAD to construct 3D non-rectangular FDSOI transistor models. The accuracy of the location-dependent weighting method and EGL extraction methods are verified with TCAD circuit simulations. A 2D EGL circuit simulation method in TCAD is proposed instead of 3D EGL method to reduce the simulation time required. Preliminary simulation results indicate that weighting factors can improve the accuracy of electrical characteristics estimation, especially in leakage current analysis. On average, the off-state EGL (EGLoff) with weightings is good enough. These methods could be used to simulate the non-rectangular transistors applied to sub-20nm FDSOI circuits including 6T-SRAM caused by non-ideal optical effects in industrial processes.", "This paper presents a methodology to optimize standard cells and other small IP for manufacturability. The optimization is based on an evolutionary machine learning algorithm. This algorithm creates variants of a starting cell by randomly selecting and moving edges, and selects the best variant based on a scoring methodology for the next set of iterations. The opportunity for such an algorithm arises from the complexity of advanced node design rules, where multiple rules compete and have to be optimized simultaneously across multiple mask layers. Doing this process manually is a lengthy and highly iterative process and most often leaves DFM opportunities on the table. The selector in the algorithm is a combination of MAS/DRC rule-based checks, and a holistic multi-layer lithographic process window metric. Specifically library standard cells can be optimized for DFM scores and printability within a very short time frame.", "The continuous scaling of 3D NAND by vertically stacking more tiers in a single die presents some major challenges . One of these challenges is the effect of increasing surface topography on photolithography. Although photolithography is relaxed in 3D NAND process compared to 2D NAND, surface topography can lead to a reduced process window (PW) of critical immersion levels. For a metal routing level near the top of the die stack, up to ~240 nm of topography can be present at immersion photolithography levels. In tight pitch regions of the metal routing layout, topography variations can cause poor printing, particularly near locations where the metal routing bends due to various layout constraints. Edge progression and corner jog layout optimization provide a solution to this less-discussed challenge in the 3D NAND fabrication process. Simulation results show a 70% increase of the PW in the areas where edge progression was applied. In bending regions of the metal routing, jog optimization improves the PW by 40%. These two layout optimization techniques increased the overall metal routing PW by ~40%, and this increase was validated by wafer FEM data. Additionally, the same jog optimization and edge progression techniques can be used to fix hot spot areas due to process variations. This paper presents a solution to compensate for the decreased PW of the metal routing level near the top of a 64-tier 3D NAND die due to fab topography issues through corner jog and edge progression layout optimization.", "Rigorous patterning control at critical wafer process steps of semiconductor fabrication is done to ensure integrity of the manufacturing process. At times, still with the entire existing process control infrastructure, we run into defect issues. Here we report an innovative methodology of Pattern Monitor that complements the existing approach and consistently detects critical defects on wafer that are hard to find using conventional wafer inspection tools. The unique integrated pattern centric approach puts this method apart from all the current inline tools. The Die-to-Database Pattern Monitor (D2DB-PM) solution has been applied to understand the evolution of pattern deformation through process integration engineering. A pattern centric engine is the key to this successful solution that is used to process large volumes of already existing Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images to perform Die-to-Database shape and critical dimension evaluation to detect deviations in the patterning behavior. This solution helped to resolve the limited Critical dimension (CD) measurement constraint that is otherwise associated with Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope (CDSEM) measurement. In this paper we report the results from this innovative solution to detect process marginality and also verify the improved patterning behavior after the process fix is implemented.", "Self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) is not compatible with every design. It couldn\u2019t pattern even number routing track, for examples 4 internal routing tracks with power rails side by side, due to the process footprint of conventional SAQP. On the other hand SAQP spacer merge technique is able to remove 1 internal metal line by merging 2 spacer into 1 spacer. It can offer additional track scaling and flexible design of track number, for example, 5.5 tracks together with 6.5 tracks to accomplish low and high performance device respectively. In this paper, SAQP spacer merge technique and self-aligned block (SAB) process are considered as one of potential patterning approaches for 1D style 28 nm metal pitch. SAQP spacer merge technique is indispensable for supporting 5.5T cell of 4 internal tracks with 28nm metal pitch. And 5.5T cell also requires the irregular metal color array for SAB and its biases which is litho-etch skew. SAB can be sized up double compared to conventional block process, it is biased over next metal line to takes advantage of material etch selectivity of SAQP structure inherently before metallization. To meets those requirement with automatic mask layout generation, we newly proposed forward decomposition algorithm and color-aware block resizing of SAB. The forward decomposition algorithm generates mandrel to spacer 1 to spacer 2 to mimics process order of SAQP spacer merge technique. And color-aware block resizing of SAB needs conditional bias depending on neighboring metal color. Additionally, edge placement error budget is analyzed with process variation band of source mask optimization (SMO) on top of overlay, line edge roughness (LER) and etch uniformity assumption. Simulation result seems to be fine to enable SAQP spacer merge and SAB integration. However, EUV stochastics reported that CD uniformity is not fit in Gaussian distribution. Considering beyond 3\u03c3, restricted design rule may be needed. To see design availability, 3 representative standard library cells were verified in design rule restriction without area loss. This SAQP spacer merge decomposition algorithm is useful since it is possible to extend for Fin patterning application as well.", "As EUV lithography is getting ready for deployment in high volume manufacturing, lithography engineering focus moves to efficient computational lithography tools (mask correction, verification, source-, mask- and processoptimization) providing optimal RET solutions for EUV early design exploration. Key to computational lithography success is the prediction ability of the underlying lithography process simulation model. Topographic mask effects prediction is one of the major challenges with significant impact on both simulation quality of results and turn around time. In this paper, we apply a fast modeling approach to EUV light diffraction on topographic masks, which is based on fully rigorous topographic mask simulations. It is demonstrating performance benefits of several orders of magnitude while maintaining the accuracy requirements for productive cases. We explore its applicability to medium sized computational lithography tasks. The accurate mask solver results will be complemented with imaging and 3D resist simulations using the rigorous lithography simulator S-Litho by Synopsys.", "The difficulties involved in ramping EUV lithography to volume manufacturing have highlighted the critical task of understanding process, layout design and device interactions, and also of optimizing the overall product integration to reduce undesirable interactions. In this paper, we demonstrate mask synthesis methods that using rigorous EUV lithography models together with inverse lithography technology (ILT) for EUV process window and CD control improvement. To enable this new capability, we have linked the broad EUV physical effect modeling capability of our rigorous lithography simulator, Sentaurus Lithography (S-Litho), with our highly flexible production proven ILT mask synthesis solution (Proteus ILT). This new combined capability can take advantage of the wide range of EUV modeling capabilities including rigorous electromagnetic mask/substrate modeling. The advantages of using S-Litho rigorous simulation for ILT optimization is further benefited from significant speed enhancements using new high performance EUV mask 3D capabilities. ILT has been extensively used in a range of lithographic areas for DUV and EUV including logic hot-spot fixing, memory layout correction, dense memory cell optimization, assist feature (AF) optimization, source optimization, complex patterning design rules and design-technology co-optimization (DTCO). The combined optimization capability of these two technologies therefore will have a wide range of useful EUV applications. We will highlight the specific benefits of the rigorous DUV and EUV ILT functionality for several advanced applications including resist profile optimization for resist top- oss and resist descumming and process window improvement.", "Lithography hotspot detection and correction in the layout design phase is important to suppress manufacturing yield loss. Although machine learning based hotspot detection methods are considered as effective solutions over conventional lithography simulation, it is still difficult to apply them to practical layout design tasks because of a trade-off between detection accuracy and false alarms. In this paper, we propose a fast, accurate and reliable method to detect lithography hotspot candidates based on coherence map. Experimental results show that our method outperforms typical machine learning based hotspot detection models on industrial benchmark.", "Layout context plays a very significant role in printability of layout shapes, and hence it is extremely critical to include layout context information while performing printability checks. In this paper, we are proposing a unique approach of analyzing layout context geometries and use Machine Learning (ML) technique to predict lithography hotspots. Our method uses past lithography simulation results to evaluate geometry margins and profile them in simple geometry rules. The markers of these rules then analyzed by our unique context analyzer and generate data set for train Arterial Neural Network (ANN). Later this trained ANN model used for predictions on new input designs. In this paper, we will also present results to highlight how our approach is better in the accuracy of lithography hotspots detection in comparison to previous work related to pattern matching and machine-learning techniques.", "Design-process weakpoints also known as hotspots cause systematic yield loss in semiconductor manufacturing. One of the main goals of DFM is to detect such hotspots. For the application of AI in hotspot detection, a variety of machine learning-based techniques have been proposed as an alternative to time expensive process simulations. Related research works range from finding efficient layout representations and features and developing reliable machine learning models. Main stream layout representations include density-based feature, pixel-based feature, frequency domain feature, concentric circle sampling (CCS) and squish pattern. However most of them are either suffering from information loss (e.g. density-based feature, and CCS), or not storage efficient (e.g. images). To address these problems, we propose a convolutional neural network called Squish-Net where the input pattern representation is in an adaptive squish form. Here, the squish pattern representation is modified to handle variations in the topological complexity across a pattern catalog, which still allows no information loss and high data compression. We show that different labeling strategies and pattern radius contribute to the trade-offs between prediction accuracy and model precision. Two imbalance-aware training strategies are also discussed with supporting experiments.", "Lithography hotspot detection using lithography simulation (LCC) in a design stage is one of important techniques in order to avoid yield loss caused by the hotspots. Conventional LCC should detect all hotspots observed on wafer and reduce false errors which are not hotspots on wafer. However, the conventional LCC is not enough to meet the requirement. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria hotspot detection method with a pattern classification technique. The proposed method uses a peak intensity value as the criterion and different criteria are used for different pattern categories. The categories are created based on K-means algorithm. Experimental results show our proposed method can reduce a number of false errors by 75% without any overlooking of hotspots.", "Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is a critical process in Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing used to ensure planarity of the layers which comprise the IC. The IC design and CMP process must be optimally integrated otherwise dishing and erosion may occur on any of the various layers resulting in significant degradation impacting lithographic pattern fidelity and performance variability. Consequently, it is desirable to accurately predict if and where these hotspots (HS) will appear early in the design to ensure high manufacturing yield and predicted performance. In this work, we use a Deep Learning (DL) multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to model CMP hotspots for full-chip multilayer layouts. The DL model consists of convolutional layers for automatic feature extraction and fully-connected CNN layers for HS classification and detection. Our implementation can learn/capture effects that go beyond traditional methods in that these effects can be discovered from previous technologies with transfer learning and the model can be trained with either simulation or topography measurement data. Further, the model is trained from multiple layers and CMP results thereby enabling modeling and prediction of hotspots resulting from complex inter-layer interactions or effects which may escape traditional methods. With the proposed DL model, we achieved a hotspot prediction accuracy of up to 98% with up to 10 metal layers. After training the model, the inference time for a full chip can be up to 10x faster than existing CMP tools. This flow enables CMP/Fill-aware design validation that can help to create optimal high-yielding customer designs.", "In this work we are introducing a manufacturing flow for the SALELE Process in details. Starting with layout decomposition, where the drawn layer is decomposed into 4 Masks: 2 Metal-like Masks, and 2 Block-like Masks. Then each of these masks is subjected to Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) process, and here we explain more about the OPC recipe development for each mask. Then we introduce a verification flow that performs two levels of verifications: (a) Litho verification, where the litho fidelity of each mask is quantified based on image quality measurements. (b) Final Manufactured shapes verification vs. expected output. This work has been carried out on an N3 candidate layout designed by IMEC.", "The effective test pattern is a crucial component for lithography process optimization such as Source Mask Optimization (SMO) and Optical Proximity Correction (OPC). The conventional parameterized test patterns cannot represent various contexts of patterns, thus sample patterns extracted from layout become an alternative option. This paper introduces a sample patterns extraction method based on the hierarchical clustering algorithm, according to the geometric characteristics. Meanwhile, an improved HLAC-based method is applied to the layout patterns at the stage of feature extraction for accurate characterization. The method can reduce the number of test patterns while maintaining high coverage of layout\u2019s geometric features. The lithography process window is analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the patterns clustering flow. Moreover, the comparison between the spectrums of sample patterns and original layout also indicates that the proposed sampling method preserve a sufficient coverage of layout\u2019s optical characteristics. Pattern extraction method in this paper could provide a candidate solution for fast test pattern generation with high coverage for lithography process exploration.", "At the early stage of a new technology development, Ground Rule (GR) calculations are performed assuming design targets are met, and all the process variations are within certain process assumptions. However, as technology matures, it is expensive, and time consuming to verify these assumptions for all the designs allowed by the rules. Thus, there\u2019s a loop hole in the GRs if these assumptions are not met on the design. This issue becomes even worse for 2D dense design such as SRAM, where the design target and wafer image are so different due to all the corners, jogs, line ends etc, and the process variations are much larger for the 2D designs. As a result, SRAM designs almost never follow a standard GR approach but its own unique rules. In fact, for SRAM designs of slightly different style, the rules will be significantly different. On the other hand, Process Variation (PV) contours offer much more details of process variations even though their usage is very limited. One reason for that is that off-nominal conditions having larger risks from rule point of view but have lower probability at the same time, making it a dilemma for us. In this talk we propose a method to incorporate PV contours in GR calculation, and each PV contour are used in Monte-Carlo calculation in accordance with its own probability. We apply this method in SRAM layout optimization as an example. This work was performed at the IBM Semiconductor Research Center, Albany NY 12203", "Vertical NAND (3D NAND) designs provide unprecedented improvements in input/output (I/O) performance and storage density, but require additional analysis to ensure manufacturing and market success. While 3D stacked architectures greatly reduce chip area at advanced technology nodes, greater topology uniformity is essential, not only for inter-layers stacking, but also for the chip bonding process. As the link between design and manufacturing, design for manufacturing (DFM) predicts potential manufacturing issues during the design stage, enabling design teams to modify the layout and mitigate the risk. The copper interconnect process can be modeled through multiple process steps, from film stacking, etch, and copper deposition to polishing. The simulated topology of a given design predicts potential risky areas that may be fixed by changing designs or inserting dummy fill prior to manufacturing. This simulation is a useful technique during yield ramp-up, and can shorten the cycle from design to manufacturing. This paper presents a solution for BEOL CMP modeling and analysis on BEOL copper interconnect of a 3D NAND flow.", "Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) is a key process that reduces chip topography variation during manufacturing. Any variation outside of specifications can cause hotspots, which negatively impact yield. As technology moves forward, especially in memory processes like 3D NAND, high-quality surface planarity is required to overcome manufacturing challenges in each process step. Any topography variation in the front-end-of-line (FEOL) must be taken into consideration, as it may dramatically impact the surface planarity achieved by subsequent manufacturing steps. Rule-based checking of the design is not sufficient to discover all potential CMP hotspots. An accurate FEOL CMP model is necessary to predict design-induced CMP hotspots and optimize the use of dummy fill to alleviate manufacturing challenges. While back-end-of-line (BEOL) CMP modeling technology has matured in recent years, FEOL CMP modeling is still facing multiple challenges. This paper describes how an accurate FEOL CMP model may be built, and how interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer CMP simulations may be used for 3D NAND design improvement. In the example of ILD CMP model validation for a 3D NAND product, it is shown that the model predictions match well with the silicon data and that the model may successfully be used for hotspot prediction in production designs prior to manufacturing.", "Use of lithography exposure and metrology tools in production typically results in worse performance than seen on test wafers. Physical design always starts with rough design rule for a new technology node. To evaluate the influence of the inevitable degraded performance on test wafers, our paper put forward a systematic approach to evaluate whether the ability of current process can support the design. The approach utilizes litho-friendly design (LFD) to find the yield killers and conducts pattern classification with pattern matching. Process window discovery (PWD) is used to collect the statistical data to confirm whether the yield killers in LFD simulation will meet the systematic fail on wafer. It is necessary to do mask optimization (MO), source mask optimization (SMO) and design rule optimization (DRO) for the real yield killers. Moreover, design of advanced node may include the patterns inside forbidden pitch range. We do the design rule exploration for metal 2 layer of 14nm technology node and discuss the corresponding solutions for width sensitive zone as well.", "In the preparation of Integrated Circuits (ICs), employing the Dual Damascene (DD) via-first approach, the fulfilling of extremely deep via and, in general, of highly etched structures, still remains a challenging task. Especially, if this is combined with the need to obtain a planar surface with a thickness bias proximal to zero between flat zones and highly via-rich parts of the die or deep trenches. Herein, we report a full analysis of the impact of the nature of solvent and polymer composing the Hard-Mask (HM) precursor on the filling of via and long trenches. The analysis is carried out by means of optical microscopy (OPT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on standard silicon wafers processed with the HM, changing different variables; from the use of materials comprising different solvents and polymers with various C-contents, up to the variation of the coating parameters such as: the spin speed, the bake temperature and the primer vaporization step before dropping the via-filler material. Interestingly, the solvent is demonstrated to play a crucial role in the formation of macro-defectiveness on long deep trenches surrounded by a flat area: PropyleneGlycolMonomethylEtherAcetate (PGMEA) uniquely-based materials can bring to a peculiar halation-effect, partially avoided with the introduction of several pre-bake steps of the under-layer on a HexaMethylDiSilazane (HMDS)-presprayed Silicon surface.", "As technology advances, chip size becomes larger and larger, this brings challenges when engineers would like to do a quick investigation of the design in a short time, like hotspot detection and layout fixing. An idea to mitigate the challenges is to decompose a layout into patterns and classify these patterns to unique ones. Engineers then prioritize their work on these unique patterns. Patterns from different products can be accumulated and recorded, when a new design comes in, the known patterns will be filtered out from all unique patterns seen in this new design. When the pattern database is large enough and contains enough safe and weak patterns, machine learning can be used to train the algorithm to predict hotspots in the new design. The key point is how to efficiently decompose a layout and group those patterns. This paper presents how to decompose a layout by using Calibre Pattern Matching and DRC. The experiment data shows that this is a very efficient way to decompose a layout automatically.", "When technology comes to 28nm and beyond, chip size and design complexity are increasing. Lithography simulation is computing intensive and it may takes days to see whether there is any hotspot hard to solve other than change the design. Pattern classification is quite a matured technique and it can be used to locate unique patterns on a chip, then it is possible to do lithography simulation on these unique pattern locations first. This is an efficient approach to quickly detect any unfriendly design style on the layout and give designers enough time to fix these unfriendly designs and do an incremental check to validate the fixing. Once the fixing approach is validated, a pattern matching based pattern substitution can be used to fix all the problematic areas on the layout.", "As the typical litho hotspot detection runtime continue to increase with sub-10nm technology node due to increasing design and process complexity, many DFM techniques are exploring new methods that can expedite some of their advanced verification processes. The benefit of improved runtimes through simulation can be obtained by reducing the amount of data being sent to simulation. By inserting a pattern matching operation, a system can be designed such that it only simulates in the vicinity of topologies that somewhat resemble hotspots while ignoring all other data. Pattern Matching improved overall runtime significantly. However, pattern matching techniques require a library of accumulated known litho hotspots in allowed accuracy rate. In this paper, we present a fast and accurate litho hotspot detection methodology using specialized machine learning. We built a deep neural network with training from real hotspot candidates. Experimental results demonstrate Machine Learning\u2019s ability to predict hotspots and achieve greater than 90% detection accuracy and coverage, with best achieved accuracy 99.9% while reducing overall runtime compared to full litho simulation.", "The 3D NAND (three-dimensional NAND type) has rapidly become the standard technology for enterprise flash memories, and is also gaining widespread use in other applications. Continued manufacturing process improvements are essential in delivering memory devices with higher I/O performance, higher bit density, and lower cost. Current 3D NAND technology involves process steps that form array and peripheral CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) regions side-by-side, resulting in waste of silicon real estate and film stress compromises, and limits the paths of making advanced 3D NAND devices. An innovative architecture was invented to overcome these challenges by connecting two wafers electrically through millions of metal VIAs (Vertical Interconnect Access) simultaneously across the whole wafer in one process step [1]. A highly accurate and efficient metrology is required to monitor the VIA interface due to the increased process complexity and precision requirements. With the advanced processing of AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) images, highly accurate and precise measurements have been achieved. An inline pattern-centric metrology solution that is designed for high volume mass production of high-performance 3D NAND is presented in this paper.", "With increasing challenges in reducing power density while keeping and even increasing the device performance at every new technology node, innovations in both the device architecture and materials will be needed to ensure continuous improvements in power, performance, area and cost. For the last decade, replacing the Si channel by higher mobility materials like III-V and (Si)Ge has been considered as one of the most challenging innovations needed to further scale down the supply voltage and improve the overall energy efficiency of CMOS circuits. While these materials will not only contribute to enhancing the standard CMOS performance, the possibility of integrating these materials on a Si platform opens exciting new opportunities to build unique circuits, systems and applications. Especially in RF applications, co-integration of III-V/GaN and Si CMOS might be the key enabling technology to provide the speed and power efficiency required for next generation mobile communications. While the device architectures under consideration differ from nowadays ultra-scaled FinFET and nanowire/nanosheet technologies, and their scaling in general is more relaxed, there are significant challenges related to integrating these components on Si substrates. It will need innovations in patterning, deposition and cleaning, next to addressing the challenges of handling these novel materials in a standard CMOS environment. In this work, we will review the status and integration challenges of these materials for both advanced CMOS technologies and RF applications. Focus will be put on the required advancements in etch and deposition needed to enable the integration of these novel materials and devices on a Si platform.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, using 13.5 nm radiation, is a prominent candidate for next generation manufacturing. Our main effort has recently focused on metal organic cluster photoresists, including both Zr and Hf metal oxides, both relatively low EUV absorbing metals. However, integration of high EUV absorption elements is now considered to be a more promising route to further improve lithographic performance under EUV radiation. Here, we report lithography of zinc oxide-based metal organic cluster photoresists, and EUV patterning below 15 nm. The lithographic performance of this and other metal oxides is described and etch characteristics discussed.", "Due to the difficulty in scaling overlay commensurate with the required CD reduction, self-alignment schemes are becoming more and more pervasive. To enable such schemes, there is a need to have materials that have different etch selectivity (\u201ccolors\u201d) compared to the standard Si, SiO2, SiN and C commonly available today. Development of novel materials with excellent conformality is needed to enable such \u201cmulti-color\u201d material schemes. Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) has been used to deposit a wide range of dielectric films whose composition can be modified for etch selectivity. But these films are limited to planar applications. With topography, conformality becomes a critical requirement, along with the ability to tune material properties. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is the method of choice for depositing conformal silicon oxides and nitrides thin films but has difficulty in tuning film composition or depositing films containing Si-C bonds. Lam Research has pioneered a new deposition technique, called SPARC, that fills this void between what PECVD and ALD techniques can deposit. This approach enables deposition of highly conformal, dense silicon oxy-carbide (SiCO) thin films, which are used as low-k spacers in both Logic and DRAM devices. The technology enables films with uniform infeature composition, and unlike ALD, lends itself to easy tuning of film composition to optimize etch selectivity for a desired application. In addition to SiCO, the same approach was then used to develop highly dense and conformal silicon carbon nitride (SiCN) films, again with the ability to tune composition. It is demonstrated that Si-C content is the primary driver for selectivity in both these film types. The unique capabilities of the SPARC deposition to access high quality silicon-based films has resulted in its implementation in both logic and memory device manufacturing. This deposition method can also extend to depositing novel materials. For instance, high-quality conformal boron-based films, such as boron carbide (BC) and boron carbon nitride (BCN), have been deposited and show different sputtering and etch behavior than the Si-based counterparts. For this reason, BC or BCN based films could add a distinct etch solution for advanced patterning. More broadly, the wide range of conformal films and compositions possible with this technology makes SPARC a unique asset to address etch selectivity requirements of advanced integration schemes.", "With shrinking design rules, the overall patterning requirements are getting aggressively tighter and tighter, driving requirements for on-product overlay performance below 2.5nm and CD uniformity requirements below 0.8nm. Achieving such performance levels will not only need performance optimization of individual tools but a holistic optimization of all process steps. This paper reports on the first step towards holistic optimization \u2013 co-optimized performance control of scanner and etch tools. In this paper we evaluate the use of scanner and etcher control parameters for improvement of after final etch overlay and CD performance. The co-optimization of lithography and etch identifies origins of the variabilities and assigns corrections to corresponding tools, handles litho-etch interactions and maximizes the correction capability by utilizing control interfaces of both scanner and etch tools in a single control loop. The product aims to improve total variability measured after etch as well as fingerprint matching between tools. For CD control we co-optimize the dose corrections on the lithography tool with the temperature corrections on the etcher. This control solution aims to correct CD variabilities originating at deposition, lithography and etcher. For overlay we co-optimize the overlay inter and intra-field grid interfaces on the scanner with the wafer edge ring height compensation on the etcher. The evaluation of both CD and overlay control solutions is performed for the 2xnm DRAM node of SK hynix DRAM group. YieldStar in-device metrology after core etch was used for CD control. On wafer verification showed an improvement of 23% of the total CD variation. In-device metrology after final etch was user for overlay control. Evaluation showed 35% improvement in total overlay variability due to scanner-etch co-optimization.", "Uniformity of critical dimensions (CDs) across a wafer is an increasing challenge as both CDs and tolerances shrink. Plasma etch uniformity is achieved in part through reactor design and in part through the operating conditions or process recipe of the reactor. The identification of a recipe for a specific etch process is time consuming and expensive, requiring extensive experiments and metrology. Here we present two modules in SandBox StudioTM, SB-Bayesian and SBNeuralNet, to accelerate the prediction and optimization of etch recipes for across the wafer uniformity. A model of etch rates across the wafer is created that accounts for injector locations, gas flow rates and distribution and plasma powers. Synthetic experiments on etching line-space patterns on 300 mm wafers are performed and the CDs and their variations are computed at several hundred site locations. SB-Bayesian requires many fewer experiments to be calibrated and achieve an excellent qualitative match with the experimental data. SB-NeuralNet achieves comparable levels of accuracy to SBBayesian at predicting average CDs and uniformity, but it does not perform as well at predicting trends across the wafer. It is shown that neural nets require a prohibitive amount of experimental data to successfully predict wafer patterns. SBBayesian and SB-NeuralNet were used to create detailed process maps across the parameters space of interest to identify optimal recipes to achieve required CDs and tolerances. Both modules can predict optimal recipe conditions for achieving identified target CD and uniformity metrics. Using these tools, etch recipes for across the wafer uniformity are rapidly optimized at lower cost.", "Plasma etching requires the nanometer scale precision control of the etched structures without particle generation which is a key factor of the defect and the yield ratio. Nevertheless, process drifts [1] and particles flaking off from the chamber wall are frequently observed in case of non-volatile metal accumulation on a chamber wall, because cleaning of metal by-product is more difficult than other by-products such as silicon and carbon. R Ramos et al [2] have reported the effective cleaning to reduce AlFx residue. However, sometimes, an etching of non-volatile chamber wall materials such as Al2O3 and Y2O3 at the same time by metal cleaning chemistries becomes the root cause of the particle and decreasing MTBC(mean time between clean). Therefore, it is important not to generate particles flaking off in mass production. In this study, effective AlFx cleaning was evaluated without chamber wall damage by microwave ECR plasma etching system. At first, effective AlFx cleaning was quantified by using in-situ FTIR equipment attached to the chamber side wall. The FTIR data showed that BCl3/Cl2 chemistry was higher cleaning efficiency than other chemistries such as Cl2, SiCl4/Cl2 and SF6/O2 for removing AlFx residue as mentioned previous study [2]. Second, Al2O3 etch rate distribution were measured using Al2O3 coupon sample simulating AlFx deposition. In this experiment, Al2O3 coupons were set in different locations such as top plate, sleeve and susceptor near the wafer stage. One of the unique characteristics of ECR plasma is that plasma generation position (ECR height) is movable by changing solenoid coil setting. After exposing BCl3/Cl2 plasma with two kinds of ECR heights at 146.8 and 197.2 mm from ESC (Electrostatic chuck) position, Al2O3 etch rates were measured. High ECR plasma (197.2 mm) showed higher Al2O3 etch rate at high chamber location such as top plate, while low ECR plasma (146.8 mm) showed higher Al2O3 etch rate at lower chamber location such as sleeve and susceptor. The scanning ECR height improves clean uniformity in the chamber. Also, ECR plasma has an advantage in reducing chamber wall damage by spattering non-volatile chamber wall materials with plasma to be able to control ECR height away from chamber walls. To evaluate long-term process stability of BCl3/Cl2 cleaning, marathon tests of 500 alumina wafers were executed. The Al2O3 wafers were etched by fluorine-based gas chemistry to generate AlFx residue. The two kinds of plasma cleaning every three Al2O3 wafers were evaluated. One was BCl3/Cl2 cleaning and the following SF6/O2 cleaning. The other was only SF6/O2 cleaning. As a result, particle count was stable during 500 wafers with BCl3/Cl2 cleaning while particle increased after 200 wafers without BCl3/Cl2 cleaning. The increased particle component was mainly Al. Therefore, the ECR plasma with scanning BCl3/Cl2 metal cleaning which could remove Al2O3 at the every corner, enables us to increase MTBC in etching mass productions including metal residues.

In order to solve these requirements, we have developed Advanced Quasi-ALE technology which achieved reduction of LCDU, along with a wider X-Y CD control margin. In this paper, we introduce the three benefits of our atomic scale CD and variability control process technology; (1) XY CD control in oval patterns, (2) LCDU reduction and (3) wider etching window using Advanced Quasi-ALE technique. Hence, we will show that it has a significant potential to solve critical challenges in the patterning processes of N5 and beyond.", "The latest advances in Machine Learning (ML) produce results with unprecedented accuracy, and could signal a new era in the smart manufacturing field. We propose a framework designed to work alongside experts: learning from them and optimizing their knowledge. This framework must be considered as a tool to assist the experts in their daily work. The user creates a measurement recipe which includes an example of the feature as well as the measurements placed by the process engineer. Grouping the measurement recipes of the same object in an entity collection allows the user to train a machine learning recipe which includes a deformation model to handle variations in structure and contrast. The new images are analyzed following the machine learning pipeline which includes the detection of features, repositioning, measurement, quality evaluation and finally the results of measurement are given to the user. We discuss the pipeline and we focus on the metrics to validate the machine learning recipe, providing quantitative results for stability and robustness to variations.", "Within the world of integrated circuit manufacturing there is a continuous effort to increase device density in order to improve speed, performance and costs. Current technology is driving a transition from devices that use a planar transistor to a more \u201c3D\u201d design, such as with nanowires or even vertically oriented transistors. The fabrication of nanowire devices demonstrates a good example of 3D etch challenges where both anisotropic and highly selective isotropic etch processes are needed. Alternating Si and SiGe layers are first etched vertically, then are later recessed selective to one another. There are a number of literature reports which have demonstrated the capability of recessing SiGe selective to Si, however the opposite is not as well established. The key challenges of this task are maximizing the selectivity to the SiGe layers as well as any other spacer and mask materials exposed on the wafer including SiO2, Si3N4, SiOCN and SiBCN. In this work, we present a study of isotropic etching for Si selective to SiGe in CF4/O2/N2 and NF3/O2/N2 based plasmas with selectivities higher than 50:1 achieved. Potential selectivity mechanisms are based on preferential oxidation of mixed SiGe layers opposed to Si, while formation of the NO molecule can result in excessive oxide layer removal from the Si surface.1,2 A qualitative model is put forth to describe the resulting etch profiles using this chemistry. Supporting data regarding F:O ratio, temperature, and Si layer thickness dependency are shown in efforts to support the model. These results will provide essential insight as the industry decides which process solution is optimal for GAA devices.", "The continuous driving force from the semiconductor industry for realizing smaller features and device structures with higher density and higher-aspect ratio poses increasing challenges in traditional etching techniques. Atomic layer etching (ALE) provides the opportunity to overcome the shortcomings of more conventional etching processes. Extensive research in this field has led to the development of two main classes: plasma ALE to achieve anisotropic etching and thermal ALE for the isotropic counterpart. Besides anisotropic etching, plasma can also be applied for achieving isotropic etch profiles. Yet, this process option has not been explored extensively. In this work, we demonstrate isotropic ALE of ZnO on a regular array of vertical nanowires, using the alternated doses of O2 plasma and acetylacetone (Hacac). A linear ZnO thickness decrease with increasing number of cycles was measured by in-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry, and saturation behavior was demonstrated for both Hacac and O2 plasma, at 250 oC. The etch rates per cycle were found to increase from 0.5 to 1.3 \u00c5/cycle with process temperature increasing from 100 to 250 oC. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies conducted on ZnO-coated nanowires before and after ALE proved the isotropic character of the process. Moreover, the ALE process produced no surface damage as concluded from high resolution TEM inspection. In-situ infrared spectroscopy measurements were conducted to elucidate the mechanism underlying self-limited etching. Based on these measurements, a preliminary reaction mechanism is proposed, in which Zn(acac)2 is assumed to be the etching product and persisting acac-species on the ZnO surface provide the self-limiting character. Finally, a high etch selectivity over SiO2 and HfO2, and the possibility to extend the process to other oxides such as Al2O3 are also demonstrated. We believe that this plasma-based ALE process represents a valuable addition to the ALE toolbox and opens-up new possibilities for using plasma-processing to achieve isotropic etch profiles. Furthermore, similar approaches can be used to extend the process to other materials by tuning the plasma chemistry accordingly.", "As process technology progresses beyond the 7 nm node, the critical dimension uniformity (CDU) requirement is now in the sub-1 nm regime due to patterning complexity or smaller patterning size. In this report, across-wafer CDU improvement by etch tool correction using the Hydra uniformity system in an advance Lam Research etch tool for a 7 nm FEOL logic application is discussed. The results show that CDU is improved by 60% compared to baseline performance of 3\u03c3 < 1 nm, and the post etch CDU is comparable to the ultimate target CDU of post EUV litho development. In conclusion, superior post-etch across-wafer CDU is achieved using the Hydra uniformity system by correcting local non-uniformity after the radial contribution is reduced by traditional multizone ESC tuning.", "Despite the innumerable advances in EUV lithography for materials, optics, and process in recent years, the N7 and N5 targets for resolution, line roughness, and sensitivity (RLS, collectively) have not simultaneously been achieved from both a yield and cost perspective due to their interdependent nature. For example, reducing dose to an economically practical level results in resolution and roughness levels that generate unacceptable yield and performance. These limitations have traditionally been viewed in a light where only conventional post-lithographic processing by etch is used for the subsequent pattern transfer. Recent post-lithography defect mitigation techniques, however, combine the use of high etch selectivity underlayers, atomic layer etch (ALE) descum, and fast-switching deposition and etch resist linespace pattern repair have overcome the limitations of the RLS interdependency by correcting for resolution and stochastics related defects and improving LER associated with lower exposure dose [1]. Here, an aspect ratio dependent deposition can be used to protect the resist lines from further notching and damage while allowing for residual scum between the lines to be etched [2]. A lithography, etch, and metrology feedback loop can be envisioned in which a minimum dose requirement is found where both the LER and lithography related defects are still correctable using post-exposure processing; however, due to the extremely long metrology times for e-beam inspection combined with the large quantity of adjustable parameters, traditional experimental DOEs quickly become unmanageable. The intractability of this situation necessitates a simulation-based parameter space optimization to reduce the required number of feedback cycles. In this study, Coventor SEMulator3D\u00ae is used to find optimized solutions for minimizing resist line bridges and breaks as well as line smoothing. Here, distributions of line roughness and resist divot and scum dimensions can be subjected to simulated process recipes with tunable parameters like etch selectivities, aspect ratio dependence of deposition and etch, deposition and etch rates, number of ALE cycles, etc. that one would typically explore in this defect mitigation strategy. The resulting defects can then be analyzed to determine how each defect in the distribution reacts to a given treatment. Additionally, further insight can be gleaned regarding the types and dimensions of defects that can be corrected and that would otherwise not be measurable using any physical metrology. For example, at low dose, a portion of the defect size distribution is comparable to the drawn features and can no longer be corrected by the post-exposure treatment. Due to the randomness of the defects and small size, three-dimensional characterization is difficult, but using simulation, it is possible to show at what dimension the defect mitigation strategy begins to fail.", "TEL\u2019s patented DCS function and conventional plasma treatment were applied on EUV PR to examine the effect of ion/radical loading and surface modification. The DCS function accelerates plasma selective deposition particularly on the top of EUV PR at 36nm pitch. The increment of EUV PR height secures etching budget and provides longer plasmas smoothing period. In addition, line roughness was also smoothed during area plasma selective deposition due to loading effect. In this study, our plasma treatment was able to improve PR roughness by 30% comparing to as-exposed litho and the performance was kept to the next oxide layer. Furthermore, an extra 13.7nm of PR was gained which enlarged the process windows of etching selectivity and plasma smoothing effect.", "Area scaling without compromising on performance has become a challenge for technology nodes beyond N7. Gate all-around (GAA) device architecture for N5 and beyond technology nodes is emerging as a promising solution and is being heavily investigated by the semiconductor industry. Imec has recently demonstrated that GAA transistor design offers 50% area scaling for both standard cells and SRAM memory cells, by stacking NMOS and PMOS wires on top of each other (also called complimentary FET (CFET)). In addition, design technology co-optimization analysis indicates that CFET architectures meet the N3 power and performance requirements (Ryckaert et.al.; SPIE 2018, VLSI technology symposium 2018). However, integration and fabrication of such CFET architectures become significantly challenging. A primary requirement for GAA (CFET or separate NMOS/PMOS) devices is the formation of silicon channels / nanowires (NW)/nanosheets (NS). For CFET fabrication, a quintessential challenge is an etching method which can provide required selectivity to recess an epitaxially grown material selective to either NMOS or PMOS channel materials into a low-k gate spacer with adequate etch selectivity in an isotropic manner such that stacked wires or sheets can be formed either sequentially or simultaneously. In the article, we will focus mainly on the Si NW/NS formation (or SiGe etch). Fabricating such NW/NS architecture requires two extremely selective, isotropic, and precise SiGe etches. As shown in Fig.1, step 2 (\u201cSiGe cavity etch\u201d) & step 8 (\u201cchannel release\u201d). After the \u201cSiGe cavity etch\u201d, an ALD film of low-k spacer is deposited as the inner spacer (Fig.1, step 3). The SiGe cavity etch (Fig.1, step2) must be controlled with an extreme accuracy and have a straight etch front. The cavity etch will effectively define the inner spacer thickness in the area above and below the Si NW, after the inner spacer etch (step 4, Fig.1). A precise SiGe etch control is essential for the cavity formation, because: (1) if the SiGe recess is below target, the reformed inner spacer thickness will be under specification and may result in high parasitic capacitance between gate and source/drain expected. (2) If the SiGe recess is above target, the reformed inner spacer will penetrate into the replacement gate and will decrease the amount of gate metal wrapping around the nanowire and may impact channel length (Lg). Furthermore, in addition to the above requirements, etch selectivity towards the dummy gate, hard mask, oxide (STI, ILD0), and low K material around the gate (as shown in Fig 1) is essential. We will also demonstrate the process performance for \u201cchannel release\u201d as mentioned earlier (Fig 1, step 8) and inner spacer etch (Fig 1, step 4) .To address the requirements described above, a process flow enabled with extremely high selective etches, where the selectivity is a function of film properties and/or etch chemistry is a quintessential advantage. In this article, we will demonstrate the significance of such selective etches for Si NW/NS fabrication.", "This study provides a new chemistry composition as an effective etchant with a plasma-less dry process for selectively etching Si3N4 to SiO2 with selectivity over 200. Both blanket and patterned wafers were examined. To investigate the parameters affecting selectivity, blanket wafers were tested. Etch rate and selectivity can be optimized by tuning the etchant concentration, chamber temperature and chamber pressure. The selectivity can be tuned from 10 to over 200 depending on the testing condition. It was found nearly etch stop of SiO2 with increasing the etching time, leading to higher selectivity with increasing the processing time. Under the optimized condition, etching rates of Si3N4 > 30 nm/min and SiO2 < 0.2 nm/min were obtained. It was also demonstrated on 3D-NAND patterned wafers of ONON stacked layer with pre-etched holes. The Si3N4 layers can be removed with lateral etching rate >20 nm/min, while maintaining the SiO2 layer.", "Metasurfaces are optical elements with nanoscale dimensions and planar profiles that expand the functionality and usefulness of traditional refractive optics. This has lead to considerable interest in metasurfaces for a variety of applications, including consumer electronics, automotive, and medical devices. Metasurface elements can be manufactured using standard microelectronics process techniques enabling mass production of optical elements in semiconductor foundries. Additionally, being produced at the wafer-scale, metasurfaces enable wafer-scale integration of optical systems. However, most metasurfaces to date have been produced in small-scale research settings using serial patterning techniques such as electron beam lithography. In order for metasurfaces to penetrate high volume applications, scalable production processes must be developed, including lithographic reproduction of metasurface design geometries. In particular, the constituent elements of metasurfaces, nanopillars, have shapes, aspect ratios, and local density variations which diverge from typical microelectronics design rules. After a brief overview of metasurface fundamentals and their applications we will discuss traditional fabrication techniques, device requirements, and the challenges that arise when scaling to manufacturing. We will also discuss future generations of metasurfaces and further challenges in terms of geometry, critical dimensions, and materials compatibility.", "With the diminishing PPAC returns from dimensional scaling of CMOS technologies, new avenues to maintain the scaling roadmap need to be explored. Design-Technology Co-Optimization has succeeded in leveraging specific integration techniques to alleviate scaling bottlenecks of some critical design rules both in SRAM as well as logic cells. Unfortunately, these building blocks are now reaching records in compactness reducing the amount of integration opportunities to enhance their further scaling. The 3rd dimension has been seen for a long time as a holy grail that could unlock many design constructs bottlenecks in advanced CMOS technology nodes. Many of these attempts have failed in providing a universal solution for CMOS platforms. However, an optimal usage of the 3rd dimension can be found in some specific cases by a careful understanding of the design context. We will review in this talk few 3D CMOS integration techniques that offer new scaling opportunities for future technology nodes. Among these approaches we will explore the usage of buried interconnects for power delivery, the use of vertically oriented FETs for on-chip memory as well as a disruptive device built out of the stack of a pFET and an nFET into a single structure called CFET. In the latter, we will explore its scaling potential as a means to position it as a future general purpose device solution for CMOS logic as well as SRAM.", "Self-Aligned Gate Contact (SAGC) integration is design based on formation of the two separate contacts to the source/drain (S/D) and to the gate (G), which are realized in two separate plasma etch steps. Essentially, the first one is the contact plug (CP) etch over S/D contact selective to the gate plug (GP) and sidewall spacer (SWS), and the second one is the gate plug (GP) etch selective to the contact plug (CP) and the sidewall spacer (SWS). Therefore, the high selectivity plasma etch processing for the CP and GP towards the other two relevant, neighboring films is a key requirement for successful SAGC integration. In this paper we present plasma etch process development required for SAGC implementation, primarily focusing on the multi-color selectivity studies, i.e., selective CP (towards GP and SWS) as well as selective GP (towards CP and SWS) at contacted poly pitch (CPP) 42nm. The primary (\u2018standard\u2019) integration scheme uses SiO2 CP, Si3N4 GP and SiCO SWS. Furthermore, we investigate the \u201calternative\u2019 integration scheme with SiCxNy films as replacement of the traditionally used SiO2 CP material aiming to simplify the patterning sequence and ease high selectivity requirements. We report the selectivity values obtained on the CP/GP/SWS multi-color stack for the CP plasma processing (SiO2 or SiCxNy) towards Si3N4 and SiCO; as well as for GP (Si3N4) plasma dry etch process towards SiO2 or SiCxNy and SiCO. Using a Quasi-ALE (Q-ALE) approach for selective SiO2 etch process is developed with a selectivity of 8 to 1 towards Si3N4 and SiCO. For the selective Si3N4 etch continuous wave plasma CH3F-based process is developed and selectivity of 9 to 1 towards SiO2 and SiCO achieved. In the case of the integration scheme with SiCxNy CP, the selectivity for SiCxNy etch towards Si3N4 GP and SiCO SWS higher than 20 to 1 is accomplished using continuous RF source NF3/O2- based process. As for the Si3N4 plasma etch in the \u2018alternative\u2019 scheme using CH3F/O2-based process, the selectivity towards SiCxNy of higher than 20 to 1 and selectivity to SiCO of around 10 to 1 is achieved.", "This paper uses Virtual Fabrication to assess the imec 7 nm node (iN7) Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) integration scheme for the 16 nm half-pitch Metal 2 line formation. We present first the technical challenge of obtaining defect-free M2 lines with SAQP, and then provide a solution to achieve a <1% failure rate using a combination of Advanced Process Control and Virtual Fabrication.", "Device size shrinkage has been one of the most effective methods in the semiconductor industry for the purpose of cost reduction and performance enhancement. In order to achieve the size requirement at the nanometer level, there are several patterning techniques, such as extreme ultra violet lithography and self-aligned multi-patterning, which have attracted intensive attention from the industry. One of the most popular patterning methods is self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP). This method relies on self-alignment of a sidewall spacer to transfer into desirable patterns. After transferring, the resulting patterns will have half the pitch of the original structure. The process can be repeated for additional pitch halving in term of size shrinkage. This method has been adapted for high volume production in the advance semiconductor technology node for the past several years. It provided supreme performance in terms of physical performance such as line width roughness (LWR) and critical dimension uniformity (CDU). However, due to the process complexity, this technique usually suffers the pitch walking effect and relatively high cost and long turn-around time compared with the direct patterning method. In this paper, we studied several integration flows for sub-30nm pitch line and space including 193i SAQP and EUV SADP schemes. A general cost analysis is performed to compare the differences in cost and number of processing steps. Besides the manufacturability, we summarized a comprehensive line and space performance comparison between these flows in term of physical performance (CD, LWR, LER and SWR) and the potential impact factors for pattern process control such as sidewall angle and step height.", "A methodology is presented to virtually predict etch profiles on flexible substrates across multi-dimensional process spaces using a minimal number of calibration experiments. Simulations and predictions of the physics and chemical kinetics of plasma etch on flexible substrates are performed using the commercial software SandBox StudioTM. The evolution of a trench profile is computed using surface kinetics models and the level set method. Local etch rates include visibility effects to account for partial shielding of the etch as the pattern is developed and the effects of redeposition. The results of the experiments are then used to update the calibrated model parameters. If the process objectives (e.g., sidewall angle, trench critical dimensions, and across the web uniformity) are not achieved, then a new set of experiments is suggested by the methodology. The process is repeated until the optimal process conditions are identified. The methodology is validated by experiments on etching line-space patterns of polysilicon films on polymer substrates. Results with reactive ion etching with either CF4 and HBr are shown and the optimal etch recipes (power, etch time and gas flow rates) determined. It is found that this coupled simulation-experiment approach is much more efficient than full factorial experimental design at predicting process outcomes. The methodology presented requires 66% fewer experiments reducing the cost of development by a factor of three.", "Astronomical X-ray diffraction gratings are a key technology under development for current and future NASA missions. X-ray reflection gratings, developed at Penn State University, have recently demonstrated both leading diffraction efficiency and high spectral resolving power. However, recent results are the result of different fabrication techniques and a single technique has not yet been developed to yield a grating that satisfies both the diffraction efficiency and resolving power required by future missions. Here we seek to leverage exiting electron-beam lithographic techniques to produce a grating with groove groove pattern capable of high resolving power. We then introduce new ion-milling techniques to create custom groove profiles capable of high diffraction efficiency. The goal is to produce a radial groove pattern with precisely blazed facets that are customizable based on ion mill input parameters. The process should be insensitive to groove density (ranging from ~150 nm to 400+ nm), facet size, and desired facet angle. Initial efforts in this study have concentrated on constraining various parameters in ion milling to fully characterize the effect of each parameter on the grating groove profile. We present here initial results and discuss experimental verification and future work.", "MOx resists have matured into promising alternatives to conventional CAR resists for advanced-node EUV lithography where these materials offer potential improvements to patterning fidelity and high etch resistance based on metallic components. This is a particular boon for processes with limited exposure latitudes such as High-NA EUV lithography. Creating and employing first-principle models of MOx lithographic processes should speed adoption and development of these materials and represents an important aspect of platform maturation. Stochastic photochemical models of metalcontaining resist systems have previously been developed, but without extension to computational lithography. Likewise, stochastic models derived from CAR systems have been fit to MOx lithographic data using computational lithography software, facilitating limited stochastic lithography studies without capturing fundamental MOx imaging processes. Recently, a rigorous stochastic model built from the ground up using MOx-specific resist principles has been developed. In this contribution, the performance of this MOx-specific model was assessed by comparing simulated and experimental lithography data for a series of MOx resists under a range of exposure and process conditions. Chemical and physical properties of the resists derived independently from X-ray diffraction, EUV absorbance, FTIR spectroscopy, and ellipsometry measurements were parameterized in the context of the simulation, and calibration routines were used to fit simulated data to experimental CD-SEM exposure data produced using an NXE-3300B EUV scanner. Insights from these models may be used to guide MOx resist development and EUV lithography process optimization. Ultimately, these studies will help to identify process windows, processing points, and possibly improvements to the MOx resists.", "Stochastic defects are becoming major concern in the future EUV lithography as their probability Pd exponentially increases with decreasing feature size and is highly sensitive to variations in process/mask conditions. Photon shot noises and discrete/probabilistic nature of materials have been blamed as their causes. We introduce models for relating Pd to photon and resist statistics under various exposure and material conditions and analyze their impact in future EUV lithography. Three-dimensional reaction distributions are calculated by a fully-coupled Monte Carlo simulation including discrete photon, photoelectron scattering, and resist stochastics. Then, probability models predict Pd from statistical data extracted from Monte Carlo results. Stochastic defect generation is enhanced by cascade and/or cluster of correlated reactions among nearby polymers/molecules due to secondary electrons (SE)/acid diffusion and SEs generated along scattered photoelectron trajectories. Pd decreases with increasing reaction density, suppressing effective image blur, and introducing quenchers, where reaction density is limited by SE, PAG and reaction site. Defect probability increases with decreasing target size for the same k1-factor, while strongly dependent on image slope and defocus. Our analyses suggest that applying EUV lithography to smaller target requires careful material choice, extremely precise process control, and further EUV power enhancement.", "Despite years of research and development, the fundamental processes of photoionization, secondary electron generation, recombination, diffusion, and resist switching are poorly understood at the atomic level for EUVL. Multiscale modeling of these physical and chemical processes can provide answers to questions that are difficult or impossible to answer with experiment alone. A modeling pipeline that includes Monte Carlo modeling of photon- and electron-matter interactions, along with density functional theory calculations of chemical switching will be introduced in this proceeding. The Hf4O2(OMc)12 nanocluster resist will be presented as a case study. Photon and secondary electron yields, electron energy and spatial distributions, and a quantum chemical pathway for negative tone switching will be presented. Fundamental learning from studies like this can be used to improve resist design including improving contrast of these materials.", "In this paper we will first review the metrology for detecting stochastic printing failures (or defects): which techniques are available and what is their performance in detecting the different failure types in regular L/S or contact arrays, in terms of sensitivity and wafer area they can cover. Although progress is being made, metrology is still a concern: not all types of failures can be detected with the sensitivity and area-inspection capability that will eventually be required for yield sign-off. Next, we look into the progress we have been making in generating empirical correlators (or predictors) that can reproduce observed dependencies of the position of the stochastic cliffs on patterning or structure parameters, such as focus-dose, illumination mode, mask bias and pitch. In this part we focus on the microbridge-cliff on resist wafers, with some initial data on the missing-contact cliff. Especially the pitch-dependency (proximity dependency) of the cliff position is a challenge, as good models for this dependency are crucial for the development of stochastic-hotspot predictors for the OPC Verification flow. In this paper we will present for the first time a reasonable predictor for this pitch dependency; but although these results a promising step forward, they are not yet good enough as a final solution. So, this type of research will need to be continued.", "Stochastic defects are a concern in the lithographic processes used for semiconductor manufacturing, particularly for advanced node extreme ultraviolet lithographic processes. Experimentally determining the defect probability for a lithographic process is extremely time-consuming, requiring expensive metrology equipment and generally limited to simple patterns. Defect probability simulations can be beneficial from time and cost perspective and furthermore should be extensible to more complex patterns. As such, being able to accurately predict the defect probability using lithography simulations would be a valuable complementary option. We show the results of a fast simulation-based methodology for predicting defect probabilities based on a continuum lithographic model calibrated to experimental data. The simulation based-results are compared to experimental microbridge defect probability data where we show a good correlation between the two.", "The methods to calculate the probability of success/failure of EUV lithography (EUVL) processes are presented. The success of an EUVL process is defined as a complete removal of the resist material within one set of designated volumes and a complete retention of the resist material within another set of designated volumes in the resist film. We demonstrate that, under certain assumptions, the probability calculation reduces to the well-known problem of calculation of probability of excursion of a certain Gaussian random field. The methods to calculate the probability of success/failure of a lithographic process are presented, including the Monte-Carlo methods, methods based on factorization of a covariance matrix, methods based on Mahalanobis distance, and the methods using Rice\u2019s formula and its variations. A particular attention is paid to the methods applicable to full chip OPC and OPC verification. The results from the proposed methods are tested in simulations and by comparison with experimental data.", "Extending extreme ultraviolet (EUV) single exposure patterning to its limits is dependent on eliminating its stochastic defectivity. Along with developments in photoresist platforms, the patterning film stack also needs to be considered. The material immediately underneath the photoresist is expected to have significant impact on both lithographic and pattern transfer performance. By designing the resist substrate interface with high EUV absorbance, there is potential to increase the EUV quantum yield of the exposure process. Increasing the selectivity to organic layer offers the opportunity to modulate stochastic defects through etch strategies. This paper will demonstrate the patterning of various chemically amplified resists on a high-Z metal-based hardmask. The potential for dose reduction, higher etch selectivity, and defectivity improvement from a high-Z hardmask will be discussed. Deposition-trim etch techniques will be used for decreasing the transfer of stochastic defects to the underlying substrate. Sub-32nm pitch trench patterning, defectivity, and electrical yield for this patterning stack will be highlighted.", "With aggressive scaling of single-expose EUV lithography to the sub-7 nm node, stochastic variations play a prominent role in defining the lithographic process window. Fluctuations in photon shot noise, absorption and subsequent chemical reactions can lead to stochastic failure, directly impacting electrical yield. Fundamental characterization of the mode and magnitude of these variations is required to define the threshold for failure. In this work, a complementary series of techniques is enlisted to probe the nature and modulation of stochastic variation in single exposure EUV patterning. Unbiased line edge roughness (LER), local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) and defect inspection techniques are employed to monitor the frequency of stochastic variations leading to failures in line/space and via patterning. Using this methodology, we explore the modulation of stochastic variations by different photoresists and illuminations, with emphasis on material and process down-selection for improved yield at the sub-7 nm node.", "The effective dose delivered by an EUV lithography cluster is composite function of the dose provided by the scanner EUV radiation source and illuminator, the reflectance of the EUV mask, the transmission of the scanner projection optics and the PEB conditions experienced by the EUV sensitive imaging resist. Open frame test wafer exposures and the sub-E0 analysis technique described at SPIE2018 have been adopted to characterize and monitor the impact of the factors above on the effective dose stability and uniformity. Wafer exposure sequences and layouts, and the details of the analysis methodology were customized to study adverse dose factors in each of the areas described above.", "Mask technology is key to enabling the progression of advanced IC technology nodes into the realm beyond 7nm node logic. In particular, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) relies heavily on the mask in order to achieve adequate process window (PW) and final yields. In the EUVL environment, mask process development and verification becomes increasingly more difficult and costly. The mask manufacture costs are driven by multiple factors including significantly more expensive mask blanks and increased ebeam write times. Wafer verification of mask process improvements is very difficult with the relatively low number of early adopters of EUVL and high cost associated with processing non-product wafers with that technology. It is therefore useful for mask manufacturers and wafer lithographers to collaborate to develop low cost mask process screening techniques as a precursor to committing valuable EUV exposure time for final verification. Previously, we demonstrated that by utilizing a toolkit of mask and wafer analytical techniques known as advanced mask characterization and optimization (AMCO) [2], we were able to predict wafer defectivity on 1D and 2D metal structures and optimize a mask process to enable 30nm pitch interconnect in a single exposure step using EUVL [1]. In this study, we use similar methodology to develop a mask process for beyond 7nm node logic contact and via layers. These structures pose a different set of challenges than the metal layer. Contact hole area loss, corner rounding (CR), and mask process-induced x-y error on asymmetric holes must be optimized to deliver the required capability. Additionally, sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) become relevant at this node. Resolving these on the mask is critical. Here, we describe the development of a mask process to overcome these challenges. We use advanced modeling techniques including AMCO to characterize the process improvements and predict wafer performance. Mask process improvements that are characterized include both physical mask process components as well as write data optimization techniques, i.e. mask process correction (MPC).", "Sustaining optimum EUV litho-cluster performance requires monitoring the dimensional variance of representative patterns at high speed and sampling density. We present NXE3400 monitoring results obtained with an optical technique whose amplified sensitivity to dimensional variance increases with decreasing pitch. The scalable technique enables quantitative tracking of site-to-site pattern profile and fidelity and it is applied here on 5nm-node-relevant EUV dense features (line/space width, line/space ends in elongated contact holes). We benchmark against conventional monitoring methods to demonstrate capability improvements. We finally introduce complementary methods which enable a robust manufacturing insertion of EUV technology; such as 2-dimensional feature monitoring and stochastic defect prediction.", "In this paper we show experimental verification of the feasibility of printing pitch 40x70nm hexagonal holes using EUV single patterning. We show that at a local CDU (LCDU) of 2.7nm and an exposure dose of 54 mJ/cm2 a defect rate smaller than 7x10-9 is observed. This result was enabled by optimization of the illumination source and improvements in the resist. Resist selection identified multiple candidates that show a promising LCDU performance and optimization of the processing conditions resulted in improved performance. Experimental validation of the defect performance was done using HMI eP5 on the baseline process. Assessment of the LCDU performance for EUV single expose at pitches beyond 40x70nm, showed promising results.", "As future patterning processes reach the limit of lithographic printability, continuous innovation in mandrel trim or shrink strategies are required to reach sub-20 nm line-space patterning. Growing concerns of lithography defectivity, mask selectivity, line edge roughness (LER), line width roughness (LWR), and critical dimension uniformity (CDU) present significant challenges towards this goal. The authors compare various alternative mandrel trim strategies to highlight potential solutions and drawbacks towards enabling successful printing of mandrels used in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) multi-patterning schemes. Through this comparison, the authors demonstrate the challenges of maintaining adequate pattern transferability while keeping aspect ratio-driven line roughness and material selectivity under control. By process partitioning, the limitations of traditional lithography and etch trimming strategies are highlighted, suggesting the need for new methods of CD reduction after the pattern has been transferred. These new trimming methods offer flexibility in CD control without negatively impacting the mandrel profile and demonstrates better tunability across different material sets, allowing for evaluation of different mask and mandrel material combinations for downstream process optimization.", "Multiple ASML\u2019s NXE:3400B scanners are installed at the factories and slated to go to a high volume manufacturing (HVM) phase. The latest generation of the scanners NXE:3400C has an improved performance and availability also due to availability improvement of the EUV sources by implementing modularity concept. In this paper, we provide an overview of a tin laser-produced-plasma (LPP) extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) sources at 13.5nm enabling HVM at the N7 node and beyond. The field performance of the source at 250 watts power including the performance of subsystems such as the Collector and the Droplet Generator will be shown. Progress in the development of key technologies for power scaling towards 500W will be described.", "Gigaphoton develops CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source which is the most promising solution as the 13.5nm high power light source for HVM EUVL. Unique and original technologies including; combination of pulsed CO2 laser and Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser pulses for shooting and debris mitigation by magnetic field have been applied. We have developed first practical source for HVM; \u201cGL200E\u201d in 2014. Then it is demonstrated which high average power CO2 laser more than 20kW at output power in cooperation with Mitsubishi Electri. Pilot#1 is up running and it demonstrates HVM capability; EUV power recorded at 111W on average (117W in burst stabilized, 95% duty) with 5% conversion efficiency for 22 hour operation in October 2016. Availability is achievable at 89% (2 weeks average), also superior magnetic mitigation has demonstrated promising mirror degradation rate (= 0.5%/Gp) at 100W or higher power operation with dummy mirror test. We have demonstrated actual collector mirror reflectivity degradation rate is less than 0.4%/Gp by using real collector mirror around 125W (at I/F clean) in burst power during 30 Billion pulses operation. Recently we have redefined target power higher >330W and its development plan. Also we will update latest challenges for >330W average operation with actual collector mirror at the conference.", "With the introduction of the NXE:3400B scanner, ASML has brought EUV to High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM). In this context, ASML is pursuing a dual-path approach towards zero reticle defectivity: EUVcompatible pellicle or zero particles towards reticle by advanced particle contamination control. This paper will focus primarily on the approach of advanced particle contamination control and on the understanding of EUV-induced plasma to control both release and transport of particles within the scanner. This paper will present our advancements in understanding and control of particle forces related to the EUV-induced plasma, for EUV sources up to 250W and beyond. This will combine models and simulations with off-line experiments as well as in-situ scanner tests. It will be shown that our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of plasma-induced release and transport of <1um particles enables us to manage defectivity levels down to be compatible with HVM requirements for sub-10nm node lithography.", "With the persistent drive to enable EUV lithography (EUVL) for the continuation of pattern scaling and the close collaborations between suppliers and customers, tremendous progress has been made in the last five years in EUV mask infrastructure development. With the advent of actinic pattern mask inspection (APMI) tool, the only remaining EUV mask infrastructure gap until recently has been closed. We will present real-case examples from inspection of 7nm and 5nm logic node EUV masks with APMI in operation at Intel mask shop and demonstrate that actinic inspection provides defect detection capability beyond the traditional DUV optical and e-beam mask inspection (EBMI) tools for defect control and the guaranty of mask quality. In addition to the main focus on APMI and through-pellicle inspection in this paper, we also provide a brief discussion of other key EUV infrastructure modules for mask production in current EUVL at 0.33NA and future technology extension to enable high NA EUVL at 0.55NA.", "Toward logic 3nm node and beyond, alternative absorber material is required to reduce mask 3D effect. One of the promising candidates is attenuated phase shirt type absorber which is effective for specific pattern shape such as contact hole. We developed novel high reflective phase shift type absorber. In this paper, we will report the blank and mask properties for this high reflective phase shift type absorber material.", "Ni is a promising candidate for future EUV absorber material due to its superior optical properties. However existing reports on gas phase patterning of Ni are limited and not precise enough to support the application. In this work, we present a two-step reaction ion etch (RIE) and atomic layer etching (ALE) process, in which the a cyclic exposure to chlorine and hydrogen plasmas in the RIE stage removes the bulk of the majority of the exposed Ni thin films, and a cyclic exposure to oxygen plasma and gas phase formic acid tailors the surface chemical contrast to form a directional etching profile. In the ALE step, the final sidewall angle is defined by directional ions that simultaneously control the subsequent etching selectivity and anisotropy. Specifically, the oxygen plasma exposure converts the surface to an oxide layer which has a large chemical reactivity contrast to the organic acid, therefore the reaction self-terminates upon the complete removal of the oxides, leaving an exposed metallic surface on the sidewall with great verticality. The self-limiting nature of this process is backed by the removal rate difference of over 100:1 between etching NiO x and Ni using formic acid vapor. The effect of acid exposure pressure is studied, and a higher pressure results in a more vertical sidewall profile. Structures of post-etch patterns were measured using AFM, SEM and TEM while the chemical compositions are confirmed by XPS and EDS. This approach is free of noble ion bombardment \u2013 greatly reducing adventitious sputtering \u2013 and has a much more forgiving process windows comparing to other reported approaches. A final sidewall angle of 87 has been observed for the first time using this highly selective self-limiting technique, which can be further improved with process optimization.", "Industry has made significant progress advancing EUVL technology the past several years leading to its full adoption for N7 node production. To extend EUVL technology well into 3nm node and beyond, a new high-NA EUV platform is needed. These new EUVL scanner platforms plan to use anamorphic optics with 0.55NA, which introduces several additional mask related imaging complications. Current scanners have light incidence of 6\u00b0, while the new 0.55NA systems will use < 6\u00b0 incidence. At mask level, the combination of EUV light at oblique incidence, absorber thickness, and non-uniform mirror reflectance through incidence angle, creates mask-induced imaging aberrations, known as mask 3D effects (M3D). Additionally, these high NA systems will have non-telecentricity, which has shown to cause H-V bias due to shadowing, pattern shift through focus, and image contrast loss due to apodization by the reflective mask coatings. All these factors point to the need of thinner EUV mask absorber, which will dramatically reduce these effects. A possible mitigation for the M3D effects is to use mask absorber materials with high extinction coefficient \u03ba and refractive coefficient n close to unity. Current EUV masks use Ta-based absorber on top of MoSi reflective multilayer. Multiple studies have shown that optical constants for the 60nm Ta-based absorber thickness at EUV wavelength do not provide optimal wafer imaging for high NA platforms. Alternative absorbers with higher absorptivity than Ta, such as Ni, Co among others have been proposed and, from simulation work, have shown improved high NA imaging at < 40nm thickness. The replacement of Ta-based absorber by new alternative material is an arduous task for the mask industry. The new absorber material must not only meet improved imaging criteria, but it must also meet required material properties which makes its compatibility with different aspects of mask blank and mask manufacturing process very critical. In this work, we have embarked on alternative thin absorber material evaluation and characterization studies to find and assess viability of new absorber material, which best meets EUV mask fabrication requirements for impending N3 and below advanced semiconductor device nodes. While number of high-k materials were considered and evaluated, material selection narrowed our focus on one unique composite material, which met our critical requirements of low EUV reflectivity, fast etching rate and high cleaning durability. Material evaluation consisted of studying mask process modules from absorber etch, ebeam patterning capability, post-exposure processing and cleaning, defect Inspection, and finally EUV wafer printability. In these studies, we also evaluated this new material for critical mask patterning performance looking at key metrics such as resolution, CD linearity, proximity, control (targeting and uniformity), and LER/LWR. We also characterized pattern fidelity looking at complex mask designs for 5nm node and beyond using internally developed advanced mask characterization methodology emphasizing 2D pattern characterization including sidewall angle (SWA) assessment of patterned absorber.", "As extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology progresses towards and below sub-7nm generations, polarization effects will begin to have an impact. Moving to higher NA will introduce polarization effects at all locations: the mask plane, the optics, and the image plane. Contrast losses at a larger angle can occur from the interference at the image plane that will become significant for smaller geometries approaching the EUVL wavelength. Some of these contrast losses can occur at the mask where the polarized reflectance from an EUV mask is affected by the multilayer reflective stack and patterned features. This paper explores the polarization effects that are induced by EUVL masks for sub-7nm lithography. The results show a polarization-dependent induction and attenuation of current in EUVL mask structures, especially as mask pitch decreases below 6\u03bb.", "We present a comparison of experimental techniques for measuring the as-built phase shift of EUV photomasks to meet the unique requirements for EUV lithography at the resolution limit. Attenuated phase-shift masks provide superior image quality for certain applications such as low-k1 contact and pillar arrays, offering increased throughput and reduced stochastic printing failures. But whereas the traditional phase-shift is \u03c0, rigorous electromagnetic simulations suggest the optimal phase-shift for an EUV photomask must be adjusted to account for Mask 3D effects, which are themselves difficult to measure. In this work, we explore at-wavelength metrology including reflectometry, scatterometry, and phase imaging for measuring multilayer and absorber reflectance, as well as complex scattering amplitudes for a grating with pitch p = 420nm and duty-cycle D = 0.33. Using rigorous electromagnetic simulations, we find that relying only on reflectometery and the Fresnel thin-mask model predicts the complex scattering amplitudes with 22% accuracy due to 3D effects, whereas a combination of scatterometry and through-focus imaging can achieve a promising 0.6% accuracy, and a combination of scatterometry and Zernike Phase-Contrast imaging can achieve a superior 0.1% accuracy. Experimental results based on imaging and scatterometry clearly display 3D effects that differ substantially from idealized rigorous simulations, suggesting the difficulty of accurately predicting 3D effects and hence the need to accurately measure them.", "Mitigation of 3D-mask effects is a requirement for pushing high-NA (0.55) EUV lithography to its limits. Both the absorber and the reflective multilayer parts of the EUV mask contribute to the 3D-mask effects. This paper focuses on the investigation and optimization of the multilayer. The impact of different multilayer parameters on the imaging performance is investigated and used to explain the optimization outcome. Multilayer optimization yields better lithographic performance by including imaging metrics in the merit function instead of reflectivity data only. Different geometrical representations of the multilayer are optimized and their performances are compared. The results show a tradeoff among different lithographic metrics with improvements compared to a reference obtained from reflectivity optimization.", "With conventional methods, improvements in optical proximity correction (OPC) runtime and accuracy can be challenging. Often improvements in accuracy have limited impact or require longer runtimes. Conversely, improvements in runtime often come at a sacrifice to overall correction quality. OPC industries have been developing and applying machine-learning (ML) methods to address both issues together, such as the Newron\u00ae machine learning family of products, which provides for both faster ML-based correction and more accurate resist models. Benchmark testing shows that ML-based correction prediction can yield runtime improvements of 30% or more without sacrificing pattern fidelity. It also shows that a ML resist model can deliver simulation accuracy 15% better than a conventional lithography model. This paper discusses the conversion flow from baseline OPC recipe to ML-accelerated recipe and presents results of a study that applies this technique to a sub-5 nm EUV test case, as well as results of a study that leverages a ML resist model to improve OPC accuracy.", "Finding a process window and improving the yield for EUV single exposure nodes requires an understanding of stochastic defects. Stochastic simulations can be used as a tool to understand the influence of the process on defectivity. This presentation introduces stochastic model calibration with the purpose of matching lithographic observables. The validity of this approach will be shown based on comparison of measured defectivity data and matching stochastic simulations.", "Advanced characterization techniques for nanoscale photoresist structure Miquel Salmeron, Slavomir Nemsak, and Patrick Naulleau Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California Berkeley The spatial chemical structure of photoresists before and after processing is currently limited to a resolution of 10\u2019s of nanometers, far above the desirable level of mono and sub-nm resolution that can enable the next generation of microelectronic circuits and devices. We will discuss in this presentation novel characterization techniques that will open the door for advanced spectroscopic characterization of polymer interfaces both in the latent image and the developed image. Among the new techniques being currently developed we will describe plasmonically enhanced infrared spectroscopy that provides FTIR spectra with nm x-y resolution along the interface between the photoresist and the substrate/underlayer. Additionally, we will present Standing Wave X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy in soft and tender X-ray regime, which provides elemental and chemical state composition in the z-direction across surfaces and buried interfaces. Currently these techniques have provided the first nanoscale characterization of the molecular structure of solid-liquid interfaces, revealing the chemical structure of the electrical double layer, of crucial importance in batteries, corrosion phenomena, and electrocatalysis. Applications to the polymer-substrate interface is currently underway.", "As feature sizes continue to shrink, low-k1 lithographic processes are required to advance chip technologies. In this context, both advances in optical systems and imaging capabilities as well as improvements in EUV photoresist have led to practical gains in resolution. This work focusses on our latest attempt to characterize photoresist performance by a metric that can effectively exclude all other contributors (e.g. scanner) and quantify the true photoresist capabilities. By a cautious analysis of the previous k4 metric for several use cases and resist platforms (chemically amplified vs. metal-oxide resist), we propose an improved formula that incorporates key resist attributes.", "Recently, the metal oxide nanoclusters (or nanoparticles) have attracted much attention as a promising candidate for a resist material used for the high-volume manufacturing of semiconductor devices. The radiation-induced reactions of ligands play an important role in the sensitization of metal oxide nanocluster resists. In this study, the radiation-induced reactions of carboxylic acid ligands were investigated using a pulse radiolysis method. The results obtained in this study indicated that the molecular structures of ligands affect their reactivity to cationic and anion species and the stability of their radical cations and anions.", "The most pressing issue facing extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) as a multi-node technology is the inability to effectively manage stochastic effects. Fundamentally linked to the discrete nature of absorbed light (photons) and photo or electron-active components in the photoresist, stochastic effects lead to non-idealities in printed features, which for lines manifests itself as line edge and width roughness, and in the extreme cases, line breaks and bridges. However, measurement of stochastic propagation in photoresist has been hampered by the lack of metrology capable of probing the resist at intermediate stages of the patterning process. Here we present the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure the image in resist prior to photoresist development. In particular, the method was used to analyze the role of bake time on important resist metrics such as critical dimension, edge roughness, and roughness correlation length.", "EUV photon absorption by a resist film leads to emission of a photoelectron and several low kinetic energy secondary electrons. The \u201cuniversal curve\u201d, used in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, suggests that the low kinetic energy electrons may travel tens to hundreds of nanometers in solids until they inelastically scatter. The fact that electrons travel long distances before they may initiate chemical reactions ultimately result in blur of the aerial image, reducing the contrast and subsequently resolution of the resist. In this work, we will present an experimental approach to determine secondary electron attenuation length (EAL) \u2013 the thickness of resist material required to reduce number of emitted secondary electrons to 1/e of initial. The EAL describes how far secondary electrons can travel in a resist film and is directly related to the electron blur. Possibilities to gain additional information on electron penetration depth in resist films will also be discussed.", "For the past years, ArF immersion has been employed as the major lithography tool in the foundry manufacturing to fabricate the patterns of minimum pitch and size. However, for semiconductor scaling beyond N7 the application of EUV lithography is considered to be crucially important to overcome the physical limitation of ArF immersion and to realize even smaller patterns. In the case of ArF photo processes, the best mask size for a specific pitch could be selected with the consideration of optical performances such as NILS, MEEF, etc. In contrast, for the EUV processes the optical and resist stochastic effect should also be taken into account as an important factor in deciding the best mask size. In this paper, we are going to discuss the dose and mask size optimization process for an DRAM contact hole layer with EUV lithography utilizing stochastic simulations; this contains also the stochastic response of the resist. In order to calibrate a predictive stochastic resist model, which is required for this application, measurements of the stochastic resist response are necessary. In addition, the systematic and stochastic errors of CD-SEM measurements have to be estimated. We will compare experimentally obtained NILS and MEEF to simulated results, which are in very good agreement. Also, we show a comparison of experimental and computational analysis of LCDU (Local CD Uniformity).", "In this preliminary computational chemistry study, we report excitation selectivity in a model tin-oxo molecular resist. Upon impact ionization, organic side chains connected to 6-coordinated tin atoms (located near the charge balancing ligands) are preferentially destabilized. Upon electron addition, conversely, side chains connected to 5-coordinated tin atoms (located on the central belt) are destabilized. Inferring from the binding energies, the ionization induced processes likely have a smaller spatial extent than electron attachment induced process.", "EUV lithography wafer production has begun and consequently maximizing yield gains importance. One key component to high-yield lithography in manufacturing is using a pellicle to hold particles out of the focal plane and thereby minimize their impact on imaging. Using a pellicle simplifies manufacturing by eliminating wafer inspections that are used to indirectly monitor the presence of printable defects on the mask. The CNT-based pellicle \u2013 a membrane consisting of a network of carbon nanotubes \u2013 offers the advantage of very high EUV transmission and has demonstrated good durability at high EUV scanner power. Moreover, the microscopic properties of the network can be tuned by modifying several CNT membrane parameters, such as the individual CNT type and diameter, the degree of bundling, the density and the coating. The challenge is balancing these CNT material parameters for optimal performance in the EUV scanner: high transmission, low impact on imaging through scattered light, and low probability for particles to pass. Each of these areas will be addressed along with simulated and experimental data illustrating the value of a CNT-based EUV pellicle solution today and for the future.", "In this paper, we present two methods for directly measuring the effective complex reflectance function of a patterned EUV mask. Obtaining this measurement can provide important insight into a number of key areas in EUV mask development, including obtaining a deeper understanding of mask 3-D effects, and characterizing and quantifying the amplitude and phase generated by attenuated and etched phase shift masks. The first method, Quantitative Zernike Phase Contrast Microscopy (QZPCM), works by modulating the imaging pupil function with several known phase shifts, and obtaining through-focus images of a target area for each pupil setting. The second method, Lateral Shearing Imaging (LSI), works by splitting and interfering two copies of the complex amplitude function in the image plane separated by a distance s. The resulting fringe pattern gives information about the derivative of the complex amplitude in the direction of the shift. We present results from two experiments: the first demonstrates QZPCM at EUV on the Berkeley SHARP microscope, and the second utilizes LSI in an optical prototype using a visible light laser source.", "Coherence control and flexible pupil fill play a key role in the imaging of EUV reticles. This is also true for lensless metrology applications based on coherent diffraction imaging. We describe the concept and the key components of a Fourier synthesis illuminator designed to provide the RESCAN microscope with flexible illumination capabilities and to improve its resolution limit. In particular, we discuss the characteristics of the three mirrors of the new illuminator and the requirements for their multilayer coating.", "Stochastics defect detection has been a topic of intense study by the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) patterning fraternity [1]. A large part of this initial feasibility work has been performed using electron microscope-based systems [1,2]. A limited sample area is imaged using electron microscopes and images are analyzed using offline analysis techniques [1,2]. However, to accurately quantify the stochastics failure rate, the entire area of interest needs to be inspected. Given such large area inspection requirements, automated and high throughput solutions are the need of the hour to enable stochastics quantification in HVM (high volume manufacturing). This paper demonstrates Broadband Plasma optical wafer inspection capability to capture two key defects on EUV layers a) missing contact in contact hole array patterns b) line breaks in line- space pattern.", "As extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) enters high volume manufacturing (HVM), the integrated circuit (IC) industry considers actinic patterned mask inspection (APMI) to be the last major EUV mask infrastructure gap. For over 20 years, there have been calls for an APMI tool for both the final qualification of EUV masks in the mask shop and for the requalification of EUV masks in the wafer fab1. Actinic, in this context, is matching the 13.5 nm scanner wavelength to that of the inspection tool so that all types of EUV mask defects can be detected. In order to enable EUVL HVM, we have developed and introduced the world\u2019s first commercially available APMI tool. Actinic inspection enables HVM EUVL by ensuring that the EUV mask going to the EUV scanner is free from EUVprintable defects that may have been overlooked during EUV blank manufacturing or occurred during EUV mask manufacturing, cleaning and use. In this paper we will review EUV mask defect requirements from the maskshop and fab perspective, as well as capabilities of different inspection methods available for HVM. Further, we will provide an overview of the history of APMI tool development and highlight challenges and successes made when designing major components for the tool. APMI enables reliable detection of all classes of EUV-printable mask defects: small absorber defects, phase and amplitude defects in the multi-layer, In this paper, inspection performance of the APMI tool will be reviewed using representative cases from programmed defect masks with designs resembling real production cases. Finally, we will provide an outlook for the next steps in tool development including Die-to-Database inspection, throughpellicle inspection and platform extendibility to high NA EUVL.", "We explore various resolution enhancement techniques and investigate their patterning benefits for via patterns of the 3-nm logic node using computational lithography. Simulations are performed by the method of source mask optimization (SMO) using the TachyonTM software. Key assessed process parameters include edge placement error (EPE), overlap process window, image NILS, local CD uniformity and NILS depth of focus (nDOF). Simulation results show that the current mask technology employing the standard Ta-based metallic absorber does not offer enough patterning performance for vias of pitch 40 nm and below. SMO results indicate that high-absorption absorbers give a clear improvement in best-focus shift and pattern placement error while phase-shift masks result in a significant increase of NILS and nDOF. EPE improvement of multiple technologies are also investigated. Novel EUV masks together with advanced imaging with low pupil-filling ratio and curvilinear OPC, combined with highresolution and low-roughness resist and enhanced etch process are among the key enabling technologies to extend EUV single patterning to 3-nm logic via layers.", "In this work, we present a novel resistless patterning technique on hydrogen-terminated Si (100) using EUV-induced surface reaction. We has successfully demonstrated a direct Si pattern transfer of half-pitch 75 nm Si gratings using the EUV resistless patterning technique. The EUV-induced surface reactions could achieve direct patterning on functionalized Si surface and potentially overcome the resolution limitations of conventional photoresists in the semiconductor industry. Moreover, this approach can be used for better understanding of EUV exposure mechanisms by preparing simple molecular systems and studying the EUV-induced reactions.", "Since the expected exposure dose of photoresist is an important parameter in the usability of EUV at a reasonable cost, the Lithography IRDS Focus Team (IFT) developed a photospeed projection as part of the 2019 IRDS lithography roadmap. We used two different methods to do this. Both methods started with the assumption that the 7-nm node critical layers exposed using EUV single exposure just meet the CDU requirement. This is equivalent to assuming that EUV users picked the fastest resist possible that still met requirements. Method one was to separate the required CD control for the 7nm node into a portion due to photon shot noise and a portion due to resist stochastics. Although the literature has widely varying numbers for the relative amounts of photon shot noise and resist stochastics, this approach did provide some insight. If one assumes most of the CDU is mostly due to photon stochastics, then substantial resist improvements from node to node, for example 20% less stochastic CD variation, doesn\u2019t make much difference to the total stochastics. But if there isn\u2019t resist improvement, then even doubling the source power from node to node won\u2019t meet CDU requirements. If we assume that resist stochastics make up almost all of the CDU observed at the 7-nm node, then no reasonable amount of dose increase meets future requirements. Only if a combination of significant resist improvement and significant dose increases is used can you meet requirements. The second approach was to extrapolate using k4.1 In this case, assuming a typical current value of k4, we estimate a typical line and space 7-nm node exposure dose to be to be 36 mJ/cm2. We used the reported historical improvement in equivalent k1 for resists as a guide for how fast resist k4 can improve. This projected that typical resist exposure doses will have to increase over 30% per node on average to meet CDU and LER requirements for the leading-edge logic devices, leading to dose requirements < 100 mJ/cm2 by the 1.5 nm node. We will discuss the challenges in meeting this roadmap and how the industry may adapt to the future challenge of lower noise imaging processes.", "With the adoption of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography across the semiconductor industry, there comes a need to develop new resist materials that will become the mainstay enabling technology. This development places pressure on the metrology community to develop adequate non-destructive techniques capable of measuring the sub-10 nm patterns that such resists are meant to produce. Recent progress in grazing incidence and resonant x-ray scattering techniques [1-3] have shown particular promise at being able to address part of these characterization challenges. In this paper, we highlight the potential for various techniques which use energy-tunable x-rays to probe buried structures critical to progress in EUVL. We show how resonant contrast can harness spatially distributed chemical heterogeneities within a resist in order to probe buried structures in a variety of photoresists containing key inorganic components. Specifically, by focusing on inorganic/organic hybrid resists, we demonstrate the potential insights from and correlation between contrast acquired at different elemental absorption edges and chemistries from a given resist.", "When it comes to the patterning of periodic structures like lines and spaces or contact hole arrays interference lithography can be effectively applied. By the use of ultrashort wavelengths in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range, structure sizes can be pushed into the sub-100 nm region. Using advanced interference schemes, such as achromatic Talbot imaging, high-quality large-area patterning can be realized, e.g. for resist stochastics tests as well as for advanced fabrication processes in research and also small-batch production. Since the Talbot lithography only requires medium spatial coherence and accepts broadband emission, the approach can be used not only with coherent radiation as provided by synchrotron facilities but also with compact plasma-based EUV sources. In this contribution the theoretical resolution limit for the achromatic Talbot lithography is determined by simulations for the use of optimized phase-shifting transmission mask concepts illuminated by compact discharge-produced plasma EUV source operating at a main wavelength of 13.5 nm. The further effects that reduce a practical resolution limit, such as mask imperfections, positioner instabilities and resist contrast are also considered. With the realized EUV laboratory exposure tool and polymer-based contact hole phase-shifting masks 28 nm resolution has been demonstrated so far. Main limitations are found in the mask fabrication process that cannot be further down-scaled due to increasing aspect ratios and pattern degradation of the mask structures. To extend the developed nanopatterning technology to the sub-30 nm region, optimized phase-shifting transmission masks have to be designed and fabricated, enabling a contrast-rich intensity modulation in wafer plane. As size of the mask openings is approaching the exposure wavelength, mask geometry has to be optimized for every node. In this paper rigorous simulations of new mask designs optimized for the achromatic Talbot lithography are presented. For selected phase-shifting transmission masks, the influence of the mask material and geometry on the resulting aerial image is evaluated along with an analysis of the theoretical resolution limit.", "The application / effect of alternative developers for resist-based pattern defect mitigation was investigated. It was found that compared to the standard aqueous 0.26N TMAH developer solution, the same developer at lower concentration effectively improve the defect margin (indicated here in the form of a defect-sensitive exposure latitude (ELX) and critical dimension margin (CDMX) metric). Moreover, the existence of a developer concentration low limit, where ELX and CDMX significantly decrease, was observed. Alternative developers TEAH, TPAH and TBAH, when adjusted to the most effective developer concentration were found to improve defect margin. These results show the advantages of pursuing optimal developer solutions in mitigating resist-based defects while maintaining lithographic performance.", "The EUV BeamLine 2 (EBL2) is being used to expose samples to EUV radiation for optics and mask lifetime testing. Before and after exposure the samples can be analyzed in-situ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). During exposure the samples can be monitored in real-time by an imaging ellipsometer. We report on the development of two additional real-time diagnostic systems that further extend the capabilities of the EBL2 system, a thermal imaging system and an EUV reflectometer. The thermal imaging system monitors the sample surface radiation during accelerated lifetime tests and the EUV reflectometer is able to monitor the sample reflectivity in real-time. These diagnostics systems will allow for a more efficient use of the EBL2 beam-time and therefore speed up the development of EUV optics suitable for high source power and high NA imaging.", "With the introduction of the NXE:3400B scanner, ASML has brought EUV to High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM). The high EUV power of >200W being realized with this system satisfies the throughput requirements of HVM, but also requires reconsideration of the imaging aspects of spectral purity, both from the details of the EUV emission spectrum and from the DUV emission. This paper will present simulation and experimental results for the spectral purity of high-power EUV systems, and the imaging impact of this, both for the case of with and without a pellicle. Also, possible controls for spectral purity will be discussed, and a novel method will be described to measure imaging impact of varying CE and DUV. It will be shown that CE optimization towards higher source power leads to reduction in relative DUV content, that the small deltas in EUV source spectrum for higher power do not influence imaging. It will also be shown that resulting variations in DUV do not affect imaging performance significantly, provided that a suitable reticle black border is used. In short, spectral purity performance is not a bottleneck for increasing power of EUV systems to well above 250W.", "For generations lithographers have worked to overcome the difficulties associated with defect mitigation, and since EUV lithography has become mature enough for HVM this concern is warranting ever increasing attention to make such processes profitable. Even though much of the EUV defect effort is focused on stochastic defects, in this work we attempt to assess and understand process defects associated with the interaction between different films in an EUV stack. By understanding the behavior of specific underlayer materials and their chemistry within a given environment we have attempted to tune the surface energies to match the photoresist in the stack. With the correct process changes being applied, we have then worked to correlate the proper matching of surface energies with process defects. The current focus of our work is specifically line collapse, and we believe that developing a fuller understanding of the film interactions will ultimately lead to a more robust EUV process for HVM. We hereby present our work utilizing the SCREEN DUO coat develop track system with an ASML NXE:3300 in the imec Leuven cleanroom facility.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) systems struggle from both low source brightness and low source throughput through the tool. For these reasons, photon shot noise will play a much larger role in image process development for EUVL than in DUV processes. Furthermore, the lower photon count increases the stochastic variation of all the processes which occur after photon absorption. This causes the printed edge to move away from the mean edge with some probability. This paper will present a model form and calibration flow for including stochastic probability bands in compact models suitable for full chip simulation. This model form relies on calibrating to statistical data from a rigorous EUV stochastic lithography model calibrated to wafer experimental data. The data generation, data preparation, and model calibration flows for the compact stochastic probability bands will be presented. We will show that this model form can predict patterns which are prone to stochastic pattern failure in realistic mask designs, as well as how this model form can be used downstream for full chip correction (e.g., SMO, OPC and/or ILT).", "Actinic patterned mask inspection (APMI) is the last major part of the infrastructure required for EUV lithography to be developed. A coherent imaging approach is proposed as a plausible solution requiring incremental improvements to available components. Diffractive optics direct a mW 13.5nm coherent beam to the mask and to interfere at the imaging detector. A motion system translates the mask between exposures. A non-iterative algorithm generates a complex reflectivity (mask image) estimate from each interferogram, in real time with GPU hardware. Realistic simulation results and requirements for the system components are presented. Except for the FEL that is likely required, many elements of the system are simpler and likely less costly than an incoherent imager. The system can be configured to image the mask through a pellicle. Of note, focus tolerance is loose as the focal distance is a software parameter.", "This paper describes the impact of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) resist thickness on <30 nm Via Local Critical Dimension Uniformity (LCDU) measured during After Development Inspection (ADI) and After Etch Inspection (AEI). For the same post-etch CD targets, increasing resist thickness from 40 to 60 nm helped reduced CD variability. This work was performed via virtual fabrication using Coventor\u2019s SEMulator3D\u00ae software and was confirmed experimentally. Post litho and post etch CD variations were introduced by considering lithography dose and focus variations in the model. Lithography and etch models were calibrated using 3D resist profile simulations from HyperLith\u00ae and post-etch Cross Section Scanning Electron Microscope (XSEM) images, respectively.", "Gigaphoton Inc. has been developing a CO2-Sn-LPP (LPP: Laser Produced Plasma) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source system for high-volume manufacturing (HVM) semiconductor lithography. Key components of the source include a high-power CO2 laser with 15 ns pulse duration and 100 kHz repetition frequency, a solid-state pre-pulse laser with 10 ps pulse duration, a high-speed Sn-droplet generator, a high-speed and high accuracy shooting system, and a magnetic field debris mitigation system. To achieve an in-band power of 330 W with long collector mirror lifetime and stable output, we improved the performance of key system components; especially, the laser beam quality at 27 kW CO2 laser output power by upgrading the CO2 laser beam transfer system, the dose stability and suppression of small Tin (Sn) debris, upgrading a shooting control system, improvement of the collector mirror degradation rate by the optimization of H2 flow condition, and changing the EUV chamber structure. We achieved an in-band power of 250W under DC operation and demonstrated a power scalability up to 365W. This paper presents the key technology update of our EUV light source.", "High-volume production of semiconductor devices by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has started since 2019. A high numerical aperture tool is planned to extend the use of EUV lithography. The trade-off relationships between resolution, line edge roughness (LER), and sensitivity are a significant concern for the extendability of EUV lithography. In previous study, the dependences of chemical gradient (an indicator of LER) on the half-pitch of line-and-space patterns, the sensitivity, the sensitizer concentration, and the effective reaction radius for deprotection were investigated using a simulation on the basis of the sensitization and reaction mechanisms of chemically amplified EUV resists. Although the relationships between resolution, LER, and sensitivity were formulated in the half-pitch range lager than 10 nm, they were deviated from the equations in the sub-10 nm half-pitch resolution region. Recently, the application of information science to the material engineering has attracted much attention. In this study, the feasibility of the application of machine learning to the analysis of trade-off relationships was investigated. The sub-10 nm region was fitted well using lasso.", "Although being progressively introduced to mass production, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography still faces major challenges for 5nm and smaller nodes due to the impact of stochastic and processing failures, resulting in very narrow defect process windows. 1 These failures are strongly linked to critical dimension (CD) variations.2 Therefore, careful control of CD is now directly linked to defect reduction in addition to more conventional in-film particles/developer residues reduction. Photoresist profiles are also believed to be one possible limiting factor and improvements via collapse control or increased resist mask thickness for etch transfer need to be considered. In this paper, most recent understandings regarding defect process window limitations and optimization of processes to further enable narrow pitch EUV lithography will be presented.", "This paper describes the successful combination of masking or beam shaping elements based on thin membranes with the thermally ultra-stable properties of the ULE [1] glass substrate material. These kind of elements can be used in transmission in the optical beam path of EUV systems.\nBy applying a combination of new technologies, thin membranes can be directly manufactured on ULE substrates. The thermal expansion properties of the membrane based transmissive optical elements are dominated by ULE substrate. These elements enable a position stability of features in the range of 10-8/Kelvin for element sizes with a length of up to 150 mm.\nThe combination of technologies enables also the structuring of features with critical dimensions in the range of 100 nm on the membrane. The features on the membranes are for example absorbing or phase shifting structures or even holes. Holes in the membrane with diameters down to 200 nm have been demonstrated using e-beam based technologies.\nThese kind of transmissive optical elements could be used in EUV exposure systems, actinic mask inspection systems or other optical systems which are using light in the EUV wavelength range.", "In EUV lithography, the short wavelength and residual mirror surface roughness increase the flare levels across the slit. As a key research point, the flares of different exposure fields are carefully discussed by numerical simulation. To ensure the effectiveness and practicability of our simulations, the test patterns are generated according to the general design rules for 7nm technology node. The NILS, process variation band (PVB) and MEEFs from mask optimizations and source mask optimizations (SMO) results are compared. From the comparisons, the constant flare has a greater influence on NILS and PVB than that on MEEF. In contrast, the flare map caused more reduction on the MEEF values.", "Currently advanced DRAM design is beyond ArFi resolution limit, especially for the challenging processes in memory cell and core circuit pattern [1]. When devices keep shrinking, multi-patterning with ArFi becomes more and more difficult to reach the process requirements in terms of pattern decomposition, process window loss with complex process integration, defect, and immersion resolution limits. Besides multi-patterning also suffers design cost, mask learning cycle and layout restriction. Currently 0.33NA EUV can provide 16nm pattern single exposure and cover all design circuit requirement. High resolution enhances 2D pattern process window for friendly layout design and better OVL control so it is a good choice to introduce EUV process for DRAM manufacturing.\nWe evaluate to apply EUV in memory cell instead of the two possible solutions of SADP with cut layer and LELE trimming with multi-mask to simplify processes. Memory cell is periodic main feature for the most area on a mask and dominates the most EUV OPC run time in full shot correction.

The pixelated source pattern is sparsely represented in a set of certain basis functions. Blue noise sampling method is used to select sampling points around the margins of the target layout for imaging fidelity evaluation. Based on the compressive sensing theory, the EUV SO is formulated as an l1-norm inverse reconstruction problem and solved by the linearized Bregman algorithm. Different types of sparse bases are also experimented in this paper to investigate their impact on the SO results. These bases include the 2D-DCT basis, spatial basis, Zernike basis, and Haar wavelet basis. Simulations show that \u2113the Haar wavelet basis results in the best imaging fidelity among the four types of bases.", "With the introduction of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the control of contamination has become crucial. Sources for contamination in EUV lithography scanners are not limited to only particle generation and release inside the scanner environment but may be introduced from outside as well, e.g. through translational and/or rotational (robotic) feedthroughs.\nIn this contribution we highlight our joint (TU/e and VDL ETG) research efforts aimed at the development of plasma-enabled contamination control strategies. The focus in this research is on airborne particles immersed in a low pressure gas flow that interact with both the afterglow of a plasma and an externally applied electric field.\nA flexible experimental setup has been developed and will be introduced which is able to study the interaction between contaminants, plasmas and externally applied electric fields. Our results show that the designed configuration allows to carefully control the residual charges of the particles as well as their positions and trajectories with respect to the gas flow in which they are immersed. These results, together with the understanding of the underlying principle processes, open-up various possibilities to achieve improved cleanliness of the mentioned systems.", "Quantum computing has been a long-anticipated emerging computational paradigm to complement and compete with conventional CMOS technologies.
