They\u2019re developing n+1 (12~13 nm) and n+2 (11 nm or beyond) so-called D1b (D1\u03b2), D1c (D1\u03b3), and D1d (D1\u03b4) or even D0a generation now, which means DRAM cell D/R might be able to further scale down to single digit nm with EUVL adoption for DRAM cell/core patterning. The cell design scaling down is getting slower due to many scaling issues including patterning, leakage, and sensing margin. Major DRAM players have applied EUVL masks (such as SS_BLP/H_SC2) on DRAM and will expand it for the next generation. Current 6F2 cell architecture with 1T+1C will be moving over to 4F2 or 3D DRAM in an 8~9 nm D/R DRAM generation due to scaling limitations, which will be D0b or D0c. Although they change to 3D DRAM with a little relaxed CDs, EUVL will be a must for the performance and yield improvement (defects) in DRAM core areas such as very dense WLD and SA patterns just near the cell array. HKMG DRAM process has been adopted on Graphic DRAM and advanced DDR5 DRAM products by Samsung and Micron, although etching and high-k engineering are different for each. Major NAND manufacturers are still in the race to increase the number of vertical 3D NAND gates, they all have already introduced their own 176L/232L/238L 3D NAND devices. Samsung V-NAND, KIOXIA/WDC BiCS, Intel FG CuA, Micron CTF CuA, SK Hynix 4D PUC, and YMTC Xtacking 3D NAND products are the mainstream for SSD and mobile storage applications. Many innovative processes and designs have been adopted, however, lots of challenges are still there to overcome. Although lithography burdens were reduced by changing 2D to 3D, instead, UHAR etching/cleaning/filling-related developments are ongoing. Micron already exited XPoint memory, and Intel is winding it down as well. For SCM applications, fast NAND and some Emerging Memory (EM) devices such as Z-NAND, XL-FLASH, and STT-MRAM will cover the market needs in the future. Due to the difficulties of the EM materials etching, they\u2019re currently limited to embedded and low-density applications only. We\u2019ll discuss current and future challenges on DRAM, 3D NAND, and Emerging memory including process, design, and materials.", "To print ever smaller features at high contrast projection lithography technology has evolved to shorter wavelength light and larger NA. After enabling the EUV wavelength, the industry is looking into increasing the NA. This study aims to identify EUV specific challenges regarding NA scaling beyond 0.55. We study if EUV imaging can still work at this higher NA and whether specific changes to the mask stack are required. At NA's much higher than 0.55, new effects like polarization will play a role, and larger impact of ultimate mask resolution and material interactions is expected. Already at NA 0.55, a small contrast loss is predicted due to the use of unpolarized light in the scanner. Further increasing the NA will enhance the contrast loss. We study these polarization effects in detail and assess their impact quantitatively for a set of generic building blocks. In addition, the larger incidence angles on mask when the NA increases above 0.55, will further enhance the M3D effects forcing additional mask changes. To enable proper imaging at high incidence angles, new mask architectures, that include changes in the EUV mask absorber and multilayer, will have to be tested using rigorous simulations.", "ASML NXE (0.33 NA) scanners are now commonly used for High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) of 7nm and 5 nm logic devices as well as 1z memory node devices. In 2021, ASML has introduced the NXE:3600D scanner to the market, targeting 3nm logic and 1a and 1b memory nodes. This system has entered the HVM phase and is shipping in volume. In this paper we will share the latest performance, with excellent imaging, overlay and productivity results. For the latter we will show record performance of 185 Wafers per Hour at dose 30mJ/cm2 and over 3000 Wafers per Day at customer. Furthermore, we will address the ASML roadmap and introduce the NXE:3800E scanner. The NXE:3800E will first ship in the fourth quarter of 2023, targeting the 2 nm logic node. Lastly, ASML will show its carbon footprint and energy reduction roadmap.", "The interaction of EUV light with matter is a critical step in EUV lithographic processes and optimization of the optical material parameters of photoresists and reflector/absorber stacks is crucial to harness the full power of EUV lithography. To optimize these materials, accurate measurements of EUV absorption and reflection are needed to extract the corresponding actinic optical properties and structural parameters. Here, we report on two endstations within imec\u2019s AttoLab that enable actinic EUV absorption and reflection measurements. We commission these tools with measurements on model thin film and photoresist systems and provide extracted optical parameters as well as absorption kinetics, respectively. These results showcase the power of these tools for providing crucial data for material optimization and lithographic simulation.", "We study the effect of phase variability as an aspect of mask roughness that could contribute to Edge Placement Error (EPE) on the wafer. Phase variability in the diffracted light arises through non-specular reflection from rough surfaces or local thickness variation of the ruthenium capping layer. This leads to a speckle pattern in the aerial image intensity. Simulations were performed using representative values of mask rms and correlation length from literature and rough absorber contours extracted from mask images. The aim was to identify how such a contribution manifests in the lithographic performance of a 44 nm pitch L/S pattern. In simulation, this type of mask roughness leads to increased CD and pattern placement variability in defocus, local best focus shifts and Bossung tilts. Measurements with AIMS EUV of the pattern on reticle showed similar effects in the aerial image. Finally, we gauge the impact on-wafer by isolating the systematic variability through focus for two illuminations, one sensitive to speckle and another insensitive one.", "Precise knowledge of the wavelength-dependent refractive index of materials is required to accurately design, build and calibrate the in-band and out-of-band performance of EUV/x-ray instruments. Such instruments include exposure and patterning tools, imagers, microscopes and spectrometers for photolithography, plasma physics, synchrotron and laser science, solar physics and astrophysics. Yet, the available refractive index values in the EUV/x-ray are often unreliable. This is due to the extreme sensitivity of materials to contamination and oxidation, to the difficulty in fabricating appropriate thin film samples, to the presence of near-edge absorption fine structure, and to multiple reflections present at the longer EUV wavelengths, which are complicating the measurements. We are presenting a new methodology to measure the EUV refractive index and new sets of measurements for several important EUV materials. We use combinations of transmittance and reflectance data in the spectral range 826.5 eV (1.5 nm) to 15 eV (82.5 nm) and reveal for the first time highly resolved fine structure in the regions of L, M, N and O absorption edges, in both the absorptive and dispersive portions of the refractive index, resulting in improvements of up to a factor of 3 compared to earlier values. The improved refractive index accuracy is validated by sum rule tests and by simulating experimental data of multilayer coatings containing these materials.", "The first planned Digital Scanner product, DS248, will have the optical resolution of 110 nm and overlay accuracy of less than 10 nm, the same level as a KrF mask scanner. In addition, DS248 has more application areas, such as individual chip customization and large-area printing up to wafer size, with KrF resolution, which are not possible with the current mask scanner but will be beneficial for performance enhancement of semiconductor devices in future. The latest exposure results of DS-POC, which has the similar imaging performance with DS248, are introduced including chip ID exposure on entire 200 mm wafer and exposure of wafer scale integration substrate. Simulation data of high aspect ratio patterning with high resolution by means of integration of multiple heads of solid-state laser is described. Development progress of DS\u2019s pixel mask conversion software that directly generates pixel mask from target pattern with OPC is reported.", "With the adoption of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for high-volume production of advanced nodes, stochastic variability and resulting failures, both post litho and post etch, have drawn increasing attention. There is a strong need for accurate models for stochastic edge placement error (SEPE) with a direct link to the induced stochastic failure probability (FP). Additionally, to prevent stochastic failure from occurring on wafers, a holistic stochastic-aware computational lithography suite of products is needed, such as stochastic-aware mask source optimization (SMO), stochastic-aware optical proximity correction (OPC), stochastic-aware lithography manufacturability check (LMC), and stochastic-aware process optimization and characterization. In this paper, we will present a framework to model both SEPE and FP. This approach allows us to study the correlation between SEPE and FP systematically and paves the way to directly correlate SEPE and FP. Additionally, this paper will demonstrate that such a stochastic model can be used to optimize source and mask to significantly reduce SEPE, minimize FP, and improve stochastic-aware process window. The paper will also propose a flow to integrate the stochastic model in OPC to enhance the stochastic-aware process window and EUV manufacturability.", "Despite being crucial in an optical lithography process, \u201cdose\u201d has remained a relative concept in the computational lithography regime. It usually takes the form of a percentage deviation from a pre-identified \u201cnominal condition\u201d under the same illumination shape. Dose comparison between different illumination shapes has never been rigorously defined and modeled in numerical simulation to date. On the other hand, the exposure-limited nature of EUV lithography throughput demands the * illumination shape being optimized with the physical dose impact consciously taken into consideration. When the projection pupil is significantly obscured (as in the ASML EXE high NA scanner series), the lack of a proper physical dose constraint may lead to suboptimal energy utilization during exposure. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to accurately model the physical dose in an optical lithography process. The resultant dose concept remains meaningful in the context of a changing illumination pupil, which enables co-optimization of imaging quality and a throughput metric during the Source-Mask Optimization (SMO) phase, known as the Dose-Aware SMO. With a few realistic test cases we demonstrate the capability of Dose-Aware SMO in terms of improving EUV throughput via reducing the effective exposure time, in both regular and obscured projection systems. The physical dose modeling capability in computational lithography not only addresses those immediate challenges emergent from EUV throughput, but also opens the gate towards a broad class of exciting topics that are built upon physical dose, such as optical stochastic phenomena and so on.", "Strong challenge on EUV photoresist includes overcoming the stochastic effect caused by the lack of photons. At the different dose range, the relationship of LCDU and dose moves differently. This \u2018breaking point\u2019 in the relationship of LCDU and dose is measured at different pitches with photoresists and masks with different uniformity. Smaller pitch patterning requires more dose, whereas photoresist and mask does not affect the \u2018breaking point.\u2019 Combining these speculations show the limitation of the EUV at the low dose process, which is critical for high volume manufacturing.", "Aggressive off-axis illumination must be used to resolve line space pitches of 28nm and below. The consequence is that the best focus (BF) shifts a lot and depth of focus shrinks rapidly through pitch. This is mainly due to the mask 3D effects. To reduce the impact the best-known method is to introduce sub-resolution assist features (SRAF). We explored wafer printing with SARF size of 6-8 nm and analyzed BF and DOF impact. Clear SRAF sizes of 6-8 nm do not print with PCAR but some 7-8 nm clear SRAF printed with NTD MOR due to the higher resolution and over exposure preference. Then we validated the experiments with SLITHO simulation tool, and we found a good experiment-simulation match of BF/DOF/EL/MEF w and w/o SRAF through pitch with the three P28 illumination candidates. Overall SRAF can improve the DOF and exposure latitude (EL) for the given pitches with SRAF capable and help shift the BF to the favored focus direction. With the validated model we further study BF/DOF/EL/MEF w and w/o SRAF through pitch with the small/medium/large sigma illuminations designed for 28nm pitch, with traditional TaBN and other three candidate absorbers. We will also discuss the SRAF size and placement sensitivities. Through this work we are confident to implement SRAF to enlarge the common process window for a large range of pitches.", "Metal oxide resists (MORs) have been becoming one of the most promising candidates that facilitates the extension of EUV single exposure by improving both lithographic resolution and etch selectivity. However, to succeed high volume manufacturing, the MORs process should be robust and persistent regardless of lithographic process fluctuation that might occur. In this work, the systematic examinations on the MORs process have been explored in order to understand the MORs patterning mechanism. We found that the ADI CD (After Development Inspection Critical Dimension) could be varied with trivial fluctuation of EUV radiation, humidity, and incomplete condensation reaction. In particular, the humidity around a coated resist was the important element that affected the condensation reaction and determined the insolubility of MORs against developer solution, which consequently defines the ADI CD. Thus, the methods that enable not only the moisture control but the sufficient condensation reaction were carefully examined. Moreover, it is investigated whether MORs can enhance further the etch selectivity while reducing the intrinsic resist defect. Several strategies have been implemented, which allow the CD variation to be reduced and the process window to be enlarged compared to the early stage MORs processes.", "The lithography industry has historically striven to improve resolution by reducing wavelength and increasing the lens\u2019 numerical aperture (NA). The introduction of 0.33 NA extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography into high-volume manufacturing (HVM) represents the largest jump in resolution ever achieved by the industry. However, even this resolution is not sufficient for the patterns required for beyond the 2 nm logic technology node. This is due to low contrast and the diffraction limit of current EUVL scanners for the mask patterns required for these nodes. Instead, the resolution must be improved by increasing the NA. This will also increase the contrast of patterns which had insufficient contrast at 0.33 NA, which will in turn improve LCDU and defectivity. This change is not without its challenges though. Increasing the NA from 0.33 to 0.55 will cause a significant reduction in depth of focus. In addition, stronger mask 3D effects can cause pattern dependent shifts in best focus. As a result, the common overlapping process window of several critical patterns can become strongly diminished. The use of anamorphic optics will require two separate half-field exposures to obtain the equivalent of a single full-field exposure on current EUV and DUV scanners. For some chip sizes, this will require stitching two half-fields together to pattern the full chip area. In previous technology nodes, the process window could be improved using SMO and SRAFs. In addition, over the last five years, the industry has put significant effort into studying alternative absorbing materials. These materials can significantly reduce the mask 3D effects by reducing the thickness of the absorber. The use of alternative absorbers alone will not be sufficient for improving the overlapping process window. Instead, several techniques must be simultaneously utilized in order to ensure sufficient overall process window. Optimization of overlapping process windows is critical for successful insertion of high-NA EUVL into HVM. In this paper we analyze how the process window of critical patterns can be optimized by using different optimizations. We will show for realistic mask designs how process window can be improved in different process steps. Double exposure from half-field stitching will also be included in the process evaluation. We use both rigorous and compact modeling in a complimentary fashion for overall process optimization analysis. All techniques presented in this paper accurately model the anamorphic, centrally obscured optics of the upcoming next-generation high-NA scanners.", "ASML NXE scanners are installed at customer factories and being used in high volume manufacturing (HVM) of leading semiconductor devices. EUV sources have improved performance and availability. In this paper we provide an overview of 13.5nm tin laserproduced-plasma (LPP) extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) sources enabling HVM for the most advanced nodes. Sources at customers operate at ~250 Watt power with high availability. Progress in Collector Lifetime and EUV Source performance is shown. High NA EUVL Scanners are in development for future nodes of device manufacturing, with new requirements for source geometry and few new requirements for source performance. In this paper we additionally discuss our progress on the High NA source towards shipment to the customer later this year. Finally, we provide an update on power scaling at ASMLs research systems including reaching a new 600W milestone for EUV Sources and the next steps towards even higher powers.", "High numerical-aperture (NA) extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) system has been highly desired [1-3] and is now under construction at imec-ASML high-NA laboratory in Veldhoven. However, there are still many challenges to realize high-volume manufacturing (HVM) by high-NA EUVL; Line edge roughness (LER) mitigation is one of the key elements. In our previous research, we studied how normalized image log slope (NILS) and resist film thickness (FT) affect resist LER by exposure at NA 0.33 on NXE:3400 and S-Litho EUV [4] . However, mask absorber/tone, exposure dose and postexposure bake (PEB) temperature were not focused on for decreasing LER. They have the potential to mitigate resist roughness as illumination and resist thickness also have. Unbiased LER (uLER) values of metal oxide resists (MOR) were experimentally measured on half pitch 14 nm line and space (L/S) under several mask absorber/tonality, dose and PEB temperature. Per mask absorber/tone the NILS was varied by using different illumination shapes. Low-n masks exhibited higher NILS for the same illumination shape, which resulted in lower resist LER on wafer. It was also found that mask tone can contribute to LER mitigation. According to detailed investigations about mask roughness, mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) and flare by CD-SEM measurements and S-Litho EUV, the most likely reason for LER difference is flare increase given by mask tone change. From dose and PEB temperature variation study, dose was apparently more dominant to resist roughness than PEB temperature.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "SMO sources with pupil fill values as low as 0.15 are targeted for use in High-NA EUV imaging to deliver improved NILS and contrast. These condensed source shapes in combination with high energy sources using 13.5nm light are placing ever increasing photo intensities onto EUV lens and masks. Furthermore, the highly focused diffraction energy of line space and contact patterns results in beam fluences that over time, may cause the multilayer performance to drift from the ideal. In this work a method for predicting imaging impacts in the high-NA, low pupil fill regime for simulated multilayer mirrors is presented.", "", "", "In applying EUV lithography to fine-pitch random logic ICs, systematic defects and EPEs take on stochastic nature, and stochastic hot spot predictions are desired. This is challenging, however, since those defects generate probabilistic because of strong correlations. This paper analyzes and predicts stochastic hot spots in arbitrary patterns. We describe the formation of patterns and their anomalies as the probability of molecular sub-cluster generation, based on the 1st principle Monte Carlo simulation and the discrete dev/etch model. The sub-cluster generation well describes correlated pattern/anomaly formation. Correlation is squeezed in the direction normal to pattern edges and spreads as the image slope is relaxed. It is independent of pattern size but dependent on materials, and thus its impact increases with shrinking pattern sizes. Pattern polarity changing probability rises unexpectedly when the reaction in a shallow image slope area enters a certain reaction density range. This is because the inter-molecular correlation range approaches optical image size, and it can be the origin of stochastic hot spots. A deep neural network effectively predicts this phenomenon and infers the probabilities of stochastic EPEs and hot spots.", "EUV lithography has been one of the key factors that enables the continuation of semiconductor scaling beyond N7. While it is a vital technique for the HVM of the most recent advanced logic and DRAM devices, the EUVL still needs more efforts in order to fully exploit its capability and extend the application. One particular aspect that has been considered as of critical importance is the optical/chemical stochastic effects which may cause L/S, contact pattern defects limiting the efficiency of EUVL. The simplest way to alleviate the stochastic effects is to employ the higher EUV exposure dose; however, this approach is impractical as it obviously leads to even lower productivity. In this work, the alternative chemicals - such as EUV PTD developer and NTD rinse which are specifically prepared to overcome the stochastic effects - are examined to enhance the performance efficiency of EUVL. The focused features that thoroughly explored are EUV dose, local CD uniformity, PR swelling, pattern collapse, and defects. It is found that, with the chemical composition modification of developer and rinse, EUV pattern fidelity can be effectively optimized resulting in extended process window and improved productivity. It is expected that this work would not only facilitate the extension of EUV application but also help understand how EUV resists behave when they are under the influence of ancillaries.", "EUV lithography has been adopted worldwide for High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM) of sub-10nm node semiconductors. To support HVM, EUV pellicles were introduced by ASML in 2016. More recently, several novel pellicle materials have been developed to offer higher transmission and support higher source powers. The current focus is on two classes of pellicles to support the upcoming NXE:3800 and the associated N2 node, and beyond: Si-based composites and CNT-based pellicles. In this paper, we will give an overview of scanner integration results of current EUV pellicles, both Si-based composites and CNT-based pellicles. This overview will cover high-level aspects of transmission, imaging, robustness and lifetime; as well as underlying contributors such as EUV-uniformity, EUV-reflectivity, flare and DUV-reflectivity. Reviewing achieved performance will illustrate the suitability of these materials to support advanced nodes in production. Additionally, the anticipated future performance of EUV pellicles when used with increasing EUV source powers and high-NA scanners will be provided.", "EUV lithography has been implemented in high volume wafer production. Consequently, maximizing yield is of major importance. One key component to achieve optimal yield is using a pellicle to hold particles out of the focal plane and thereby minimize the printing of defects. The carbon nanotube (CNT) pellicle is a membrane consisting of a network of carbon nanotubes, which demonstrates EUV transmission up to 98%. The challenge is to balance the CNT material parameters for optimal performance in the EUV scanner: low probability for particles to pass, high durability in the scanner environment, while maintaining high transmission and low impact on imaging. While our earlier reporting on full-field CNT pellicle exposures demonstrated minimal impact on imaging, the focus of the current paper is on extended exposures on NXE:3400. In the scanner, the EUV light induces a hydrogen plasma that etches the CNTs, resulting in decreasing membrane density and increasing EUV transmission. In this work, we quantify the CNT pellicle etch rate in a real scanner environment and correlate the findings to those obtained in an offline test setup. Our exposures were performed using two different pellicles, with EUV transmission of 89% and 95%, for up to 3000 wafers. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of pellicle purification prior to mounting on the reticle, which is important to avoid contamination from the as-fabricated CNT pellicle onto the reticle surface. Current ongoing developments focus on further increasing the pellicle durability in the scanner environment. The presented results demonstrate the potential of a CNT-based pellicle at high EUV powers.", "This study investigates the role of EUV mask absorber materials defects on stochastic defect formation in a lithographic process using simulations. The purpose of these simulations is to compare absorber materials by their role of affecting stochastic defects as well as CD performance in the lithographic process. The absorber materials are tested for bright and dark field masks using low defectivity and CD criteria to define process windows for different pattern types. The process windows are examined to identify and compare an estimated process window overlap that takes patterns, material, CD performance and defectivity into account. The defectivity of the stochastic process simulation was increased using a modification to the distribution of chemical components that resembles the effect of PAG and Quencher molecules forming clusters. The study demonstrates that the overlap of low defectivity process windows strongly depends on the types of patterns and the absorber material.", "The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) pellicle on the EUV mask is used to prevent the image distortion, and the lifetime of the pellicle is important because it is directly related to the yield. However, particle defects can significantly impact the lifetime of the pellicle, causing thermal or mechanical damage such as deformation or increased temperature. To study these effects, we explored how particle defects affect the pellicle, including scenarios where defects on the pellicle or collide with it. We found that there was no temperature and stress accumulation with repeated exposure of the pellicle regardless of the defect exitance. The collision of flying particles gave little mechanical effect with the known impulse inside the scanner. The metal-silicide core pellicles showed better thermal stability compared to the poly-silicon core pellicles and that could be the reason why metal-silicide pellicles showed longer lifetime.", "Layout designs are reaching the resolution limit for 0.33NA extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) systems, with 0.55NA high-NA on the horizon. Alternative mask designs at reduced absorber thickness for higher image contrast have become necessary. Novel absorber candidates are classified as attenuated phase shifting mask (attPSM) absorbers, high-k mask absorbers and index matched absorbers (n \u2248 1) based on the complex refractive index (n \u2013 ik). We identify absorber candidates through effective media approximation (EMA) model and discuss design considerations for attPSM absorbers. Optimum phase shift for EUV attPSM is higher than \u03c0 and it is influenced by the absorber material, diffraction angle at the mask, mask pattern, NA and absorber reflectivity. Index matched mask absorber designs with higher extinction coefficient are also proposed as promising candidates.", "Transistor pitch scaling drives the evolution of chip design. The late arrival of EUV lithography prompted the adoption of multiple patterning using 193i to continue transistor scaling. To facilitate multiple patterning integration schemes, the 2D design style was abandoned and unidirectional design style became dominant. As transistor scaling continues further, the demand on routing resources can exceed their supply leading to routing congestion. Exploration on 1.5D or curvilinear routing to resolve higher Metal 2 usage was studied. Nowadays, EUV lithography re-introduced single patterning for the most advanced nodes. At the same time, Multi Beam Mask Writer (MBMW) enables true curvilinear masks. The use of curvilinear routing can potentially resolve routing congestion and more relax design rule check by combining EUV lithography and MBMW. This paper focuses on the challenges in optical proximity correction (OPC) on a design with curvilinear routing. Wafer data will be evaluated to assess quality. The target design is a D-flipflop using 2D and curvilinear features in a local interconnect layer to reduce the congestion. The base pitch of this design was scaled from 40nm to 32nm. The test design was then OPCed using Model Based OPC and Inverse Lithography Technique. Finally wafer data and process window analysis across the pitch range from different OPC variations will be revealed.", "To maintain good critical dimension control, optical proximity correction (OPC) has relied on fast compact models to capture the underlying lithography process in advanced nodes. Compact models have always been deterministic in the sense that they predict the average dimensions or contours on wafer. With the introduction of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, this approach breaks down due to large variabilities in EUV lithography processes. Recently, empirical correlations were found between this variability and imaging metrics, allowing the development of compact models. Such stochastic models have been used successfully to predict hotspots. In this paper an attempt is made to apply such stochastic models during OPC to reduce the number of stochastic failures. Different OPC strategies are applied on an advanced random logic and SRAM design, focusing on a via layer with a calibrated stochastic model. Through simulations, we show that the failure rate can be reduced by using a stochastic model during OPC, at the expense of edge placement error. However, when reducing the stochastic band width to match the process variation band width, no meaningful differences were observed between process-window OPC and stochastic OPC due to uniformity of pattern dimensions in sample layout.", "In this paper, we present a new approach to EUV source optimization which automatically generates a binary solution for the intensities of almost all the pixels. The benefit of such a binary solution is that the source power is distributed evenly over all the illuminated pixels, thus avoiding large intensity spikes which can lead to accelerated, radiation-induced degradation of certain parts of the imaging system.", "Tail CD was previously introduced as an empirical metric that correlates the CD distributions rather than mean CD to observed defect failure rates. It was found useful for the prediction of defect process windows, but also showed its limitation on the \u201cmerge\u201d defect in dense hexagonal contact hole patterns. Results of a follow-up study are shown here to address this limitation by exercising the Tail CD concept on a new metric called \u2018Wall CD\u2019. The Wall CD showed orientation-depended performance that could be traced back to the illumination shape explaining the predominance of diagonal merges in the contact hole failure rates. Verification of the new approach demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the predicted defect process window. Furthermore, we utilized data analytics techniques to investigate the impact of additional parameters collected during the Wall CD extraction. This analysis demonstrated, in addition to the mean and variance, the importance of the higher statistical moments (skew, kurtosis) of the distributions for the prediction of defects and the relevance of incorporating further parameters into defect models.", "By adopting the new design of the optics within the scanner, high-NA (0.55NA) EUV lithography enables higher resolution, which will push the EUV single patterning down to pitch 16nm (k1=0.34, the same k1 value as pitch 28nm for 0.33NA EUV single patterning). Therefore, 0.55NA EUVL is projected to print the most critical features of 2nm node (and beyond) logic chips with less patterning steps than 0.33NA EUVL, and is highly expected by the industry. Besides, novel low-n low-k absorber attenuated phase shift masks (low-n attPSMs) are commercially available recently, which have shown substantial imaging, as well as patterning performance improvements both in simulations and experiments. Thus, in this paper, we evaluate the feasibility and limits of logic metal scaling with 0.55NA EUV single pattering using source mask optimization tool, both binary and low-n attPSMs are used to pattern an imec N3 (pitch 28nm, foundry N2 equivalent) random logic metal design and the linear scaled versions (down to pitch 18nm). The impact of design orientations (horizontal vs. vertical) and mask tones (dark field vs. bright field) on patterning fidelity and overall process window is evaluated.", "Control of the Local Critical Dimension Uniformity (LCDU) and the associated Edge Placement Error of contact holes (CHs) is important for the implementation of EUV lithography in high-volume production today and for future nodes. The Systematic part of the LCDU is governed by the local CD variation on the mask, multiplied with a Mask Error Enhancement Factor (MEEF). Recent studies have shown that the relevant MEEF to predict the LCDU systematics is the Local MEEF, where not all CHs grow at the same time. This stands in contrast to the more commonly used Global MEEF, that quantifies the wafer CD impact of all CHs growing simultaneously on mask. In this work, we experimentally study how the systematic LCDU, and the Local and Global MEEF depend on illumination condition and mask variability strengths and signatures. We expose a test mask with programmed local CD variability on an NXE:3400 exposure tool and perform anchored CDSEM metrology on the mask and on wafer. Our results show that the illumination condition and the local mask CD fingerprint impact the Global and Local MEEF independently in a non-trivial way. Two pupils with similar Global MEEF show a 55% difference in Local MEEF and systematic LCDU component. Optimizing the pupil for Global MEEF therefore does not guarantee an optimum Local MEEF (or Systematic LCDU).", "In this paper, the role of sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) in 0.55NA EUV lithography is discussed. We demonstrate how SRAFs help with pattern placement error (PPE) control through exposure focus on horizontal line/space structures using dark field masks. Even for 26nm minimum pitch design rules (relatively high k1), SRAFs help control the focus budget. Next, an analysis of the mask variability budget is done. We establish that a tight CD and placement control on the SRAFs is required for keeping PPE through focus under control. A variability budget of 0.5nm (1X) for both CD and PPE is shown to be just sufficient for maintaining a 40nm depth of focus (DoF) in the absence of process variability. PPE variability due to resist stochastics further reduces the available DoF.", "Next generation EUV scanners have been introduced with anamorphic, obscured multi-layer optics for operation at 0.55NA. Aberrations are of particular concern with high-NA EUVL, as the 13.5nm wavelength has returned wavefront phase errors to near I-line levels. With the central obscuration necessary so that additional lenses aren\u2019t needed, the Zernike basis is no longer orthonormal, resulting in coefficient values which are dependent on the number of fitted terms. For an industry transition to a Fringe Tatian wavefront description to be successful, it is important to incorporate and carryover the intuitive understanding of the imaging effects of common aberrations. Using modifications to Prolith and Dr.LiTHO lithography simulators, this work defines a simulated lithography lens using the Fringe Tatian basis and includes simulations of common patterning conditions for next generation high-NA EUV nodes.", "An increased interest to stitching for High NA EUVL is observed; this is driven by expected higher demand of larger size chips for various applications. In the past a recommendation was published [1] to have 1-5 um band where no critical structures of a High NA layer would be allowed. In [2], we have introduced new insights on at-resolution stitching. In this publication, we present new experimental results obtained on NXE:3400B scanner. In the past we showed NXE feasibility results of vertical lines and contact holes stitching at relaxed resolution (40-48 nm pitch) in a single wafer location. In this study we evaluate stitching behavior through slit at more aggressive resolutions (P36 and P24 lines / spaces). We provide an overview of interactions in the stitching area such as aerial image interactions, absorber reflection, absorber to black border transition, black border vicinity impact and show corresponding experimental and simulations results. We formulate initial requirements for black border edge placement control and show performance of new masks. For stitching with low-n masks, we discuss using sub-resolution gratings to suppress the elevated mask reflectivity. We show rigorous simulations of stitched images, its sensitivity to overlay errors and propose mitigation mechanisms for OPC. Finally, an overview of stitching enablers will be described: from improved reticle black border position accuracy and absorber reflectivity control to mask resolution and OPC requirements.", "The foundations of leading edge DRAM manufacturing are built on accurate EUV lithography exposures in close synergy with cutting-edge immersion layers as well as advanced patterning schemes (e.g. self-aligned multiple patterning). Final device yield critically depends on the subsequent and accurate stacking of multiple layers with device features of precise width and edge placement. To support the ever-decreasing requirements for both the EUV as well as the DUV, (edge) placement accuracy, scanner enhancements are required on both platforms. In this paper we report on the improvements of the NXT:2100i immersion scanner to further reduce the (edge) placement errors within the die (intra-field) and across the full wafer (inter-field). The NXT:2100i incorporates a new projection optics with built-in distortion manipulator that extends the intra-field correction capability for both X and Y directions. The external overlay interface is extended with the distortion manipulator degrees of freedom to handle high spatial frequent distortion data of a to-be-matched scanner or high spatial frequent overlay fingerprints measured by after develop or after etch metrology. Thermal conditioning of the reticle is improved with a fast conditioned internal reticle library resulting in lower reticle-to-reticle temperature variation. Improved lens metrology (aberrations) and reticle align accuracy (alignment/overlay) is achieved with a better integrated image sensor. Improved alignment accuracy and reduced alignment process dependencies for wafer alignment are realized with 12-colors parallel measurements and by adding more alignment marks measurements at the wafer measure side without throughput impact. In concert with the hardware components, various software algorithms are updated, yielding improved inter- and intra-field overlay setup and improved reticle heating induced overlay. We will detail the specific module performance items as well as the system performance of the NXT:2100i scanner, both in reference (DRAM relevant overlay) to DUV as well as to EUV scanners.", "In an earlier publication, we evaluated simulation methods to explore overlay performance implications when a highNumerical Aperture (high-NA) Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) exposure is mixed and matched with a 0.33NA EUV full field exposure. The present contribution goes beyond the method description and aims to quantify the overlay performance impact in such a mix and match case, giving insight into the influence of different sets of overlay corrections. To this aim, the Mont Carlo engine has been updated to accommodate overlay corrections with up to 57 parameters. Since high-NA EUV is not yet available, typical overlay correction terms from IBM\u2019s 0.33NA EUV tool have been used to approximate a realistic image placement error fingerprint for our simulations. As a result, we demonstrate the benefit of various overlay correction sets, and the detrimental effect when using different masks for top and bottom half fields. Such information can also help to infer design layout placement decisions to avoid hot spot regions.", "Imec logic N2+ design rule defines a minimum via pitch of 36nm. An EUV single patterning solution at 0.33 NA is explored on a random logic via design. From an earlier simulation study , it was shown that Ta-based bright field mask delivers the best resolution enhancement technology (RET) solution. In this paper the simulation results will be validated on wafer. Negative-tone development (NTD) with a metal-oxide resist process using a bright field (BF) mask and positivetone development (PTD) with a chemically amplified resist process using a dark field (DF) mask are compared. In addition, source-mask optimizations (SMO) including sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) were used as a RET, and optical proximity correction (OPC) was carried out on the design clips to achieve optimum lithography performance. We report the best choice among the listed options, and present our recommendation on OPC, RET and process based on the simulation and wafer data in order to improve the resolution, therefore extending the single exposure pitch limit.", "This paper presents a study on a new method to create exposure profiles that are optimized for selected die areas where patterning is critical. This new \u201cregion of interest leveling (L-ROI)\u201d method caters for trends in the memory market, where intra-die topography with height steps between for instance cell and periphery areas is commonly observed for several 3D-NAND and DRAM device layers. The method takes advantage of the presence of (periphery) die areas where for some device layers patterning is less important than for other, more critical die areas, like the cell area in 3D-NAND. The L-ROI exposure profiles are insensitive to intra-die topography and to variation of the intra-die topography. They result in tighter focus uniformity (FU) in regions of interest, and thus in tighter CDU as well, than conventional exposures at the cost of an accepted performance degradation in other, non-care areas. Results of a study on a VNAND channel hole layer are presented, including focus performance simulation results and CDU measurement results from in-resist verification of L-ROI functionality on an immersion lithography scanner. The latter show a 31.7% CDU improvement with respect to conventional exposure mode.", "", "It is well known that the computations required to manufacture semiconductors have been increasing exponentially. Optical Proximity Correction has so far consumed the largest share of a fab\u2019s compute cycles, but other kinds of calculations, for example during inline inspection, have also been growing steadily. With the relentless march of technology nodes, we have had to squeeze increasingly complex Physics into a limited compute envelope, due to which simplifying assumptions made for one technology node tend to become invalid at the next node. Accelerated computing solves this problem in two different ways \u2013 by drastically reducing the cycle time for increasingly complex calculations, and by freeing up the compute envelope to allow the incorporation of previously prohibitive physical effects or compensation. The other trend that is sweeping all manner of computations in the world today \u2013 from search to scientific simulation \u2013 is the increasing reliance on AI, and silicon manufacturing is no exception. This talk will describe these larger trends towards Accelerated Computing and give examples of how its use in silicon manufacturing will likely be required for the fastest time to market.", "In advanced semiconductor memory manufacturing, the feature size keeps aggressively shrinking, creating problems in the fabrication process and leading to decreasing yield. Three key factors that can impact memory process and yield are lithographic process window, full field CD uniformity (CDU), and correction run time performance. In this paper, we describe and present a mask processing technique utilizing a) global array detect (GAD) for detecting and optimizing cell repetition, b) periodic boundary condition (PBC) for preserving simulation and mask symmetry, and c) cell-level ILT (CLILT) flow to process repeated cell regions and blend various design parts. With GAD + PBC + CL-ILT processing, we can achieve a perfectly consistent mask array region with enlarged process window and minimum local CD variation for a full field mask. Moreover, with fewer pattern units (called templates) to process, we can complete full chip ILT with reasonable time and compute resources compared to OPC full chip correction. In this paper, we show simulation and wafer print results including pattern fidelity, process window, mask consistency, and run time data.", "The original inverse lithography technology (ILT) commitment of creating a free-form mask from ex nihilo underwent transformation under pressure of constraints that are imposed by the capabilities of manufacturing and inspection equipment. This pressure became especially noticeable in the dealing with sub-resolution assist features (SRAF). The freeform SRAFs are naturally unmanufacturable and hard to inspect. In addition to this complication, the ILT signal for SRAFs is substantially weaker and often ill-defined in comparison to a strong signal from fidelity objectives to print main features on target. So, it is difficult to automatically produce SRAFs that are simultaneously geometrically stable, do not print, MRC-clean, and deliver the best lithographic quality. To overcome these obstacles, we propose new concept of structured SRAFs by combining ILT ideas with robust geometrical parameterization to introduce well-behaved and MRC-clean by construction mask decorations.", "The edge-based OPC has been serving the industry for more than 20 years with few changes in the way to alter the mask. In the past 10 years, ILT pioneers in the creation of the curvilinear mask using alternate algorithms. The two approaches differ so much that the experiences in conventional OPC do not easily translate to the use of ILT and vice versa. In this paper, we report a new system for curvilinear OPC built on top of the conventional OPC workflow without being limited to moving edges. It creates and manipulates the curvilinear shapes by generalizing the edge-based OPC to vertices. Conventional OPC techniques, including dissection, classification, target point placement, etc., keep playing central roles. Full-chip correction results demonstrate the good performance of the curvilinear mask for both contact and line/space patterns. The runtime cost of adoption is reported.", "As the industry is developing curvilinear mask solutions, some curvilinear post-OPC masks have been reported with file sizes in excess of 10 times the corresponding Manhattan post-OPC files, which can greatly impact mask data storage, transfer and processing. Some file size reduction utilizing spline fittings has been reported in mask post-processing. However, from an OPC perspective, mask post-processing is undesirable. In this study, we show that maintaining an adequate density of mask control points (MCPs) is key to achieving the desired on-wafer lithographic performance, regardless of whether the MCPs are connected by spline sections or piecewise-linear segments. Our results suggest that) may not offer clear lithographic performance or file size benefits. We will also offer some guidance for controlling piecewise-linear file size without compromising lithographic performance.", "Multi-beam writer endowed photomask manufacturers a freedom in curvilinear design without concern for photomask write time. However, a similar concern is now happening in edge-based Mask Process Correction (MPC). When curvilinear pattern gets MPC, the number of figures tend to increase dramatically and takes longer time to process, just like VSB writer experienced shot count and write time increase before. NuFlare Technology Inc. has been developing inline, pixel-based MPC software and hardware embedded on multi-beam writer. This paper describes how our inline, pixel-based MPC achieves pattern fidelity enhancement and zero additional turn-around-time at the same time.", "The technological demands on the semiconductor industry continuously require shrinking feature critical dimensions (CDs) and improved feature CD control. To meet feature CD demands requires advances in DUV and EUV lithography as well as improvements in photoresists, including negative tone-development (NTD) and positive tonedevelopment (PTD), materials properties and processing. As an example, the semiconductor industry has benefited from significant improvements in 193nm lithographic resolution and process window with NTD photoresist (resist) patterning processes of trench and hole/via features. Consequently, optical proximity correction (OPC) compact modeling of NTD resists has needed to advance to accurately model the different chemical and physical material properties, including the deformation, of thin films. From a fundamental point of view, while the basic deformation and shrinkage behavior observed in NTD resists is captured by rigorous and compact simulators, there remains known complex phenomena, such as polymer entanglements, strain softening, and strain hardening, in the materials science community, that are not present in the current models applied in OPC. In this paper, we describe these phenomena and, where appropriate, their impact on compact and rigorous resist modeling. Finally, we discuss how these newly addressed deformation effects may improve overall OPC accuracy and therefore enable further feature CD reduction and control.", "As chip manufacturers seek to reduce the pitch of metal layers, there is growing interest in replacing the multiple patterning process of 0.33NA EUV with a single patterning of high NA (0.55NA) EUV. However, to resolve a logic metal layout with a minimum pitch of 20-24nm, careful use of resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) and SMO (source mask optimization) is required in high NA EUV. Logic metal patterns are complex and have various feature designs, making it essential to ensure sufficient patterning performance across all pitches and for variations of tip-to-tip (T2T) structures with a tight size. In this study, we simulated and evaluated patterning on a typical logic metal layout representing 1.4nm to 1nm technology nodes. Our study demonstrates that compromised criteria are necessary to ensure the NILS (normalized image log-slope) level of the minimum pitch and the overlap critical dimension (CD) process window (PW). In optical proximity correction (OPC), sub-resolution assistant features (SRAF) help to improve the process window of isolated and semi-iso line-and-space (L/S) patterns. However, we found that the limiting patterns are the tight T2T structures. Aberration sensitivity showed a linear response that is more pronounced to pattern placement errors (PPE) than to CDs. The coma series aberration showed the highest sensitivity to PPE and CD. Overall, our study demonstrates that RETs, rigorous SMO solutions, and a minimum T2T size are required to achieve the replacement of 0.33NA EUV multi-patterning with a 0.55NA EUV single patterning (SP) for logic metal layers with minimum pitches of 20-24nm.", "Among several critical layers of DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), capacitor holes of honeycomb arrays and bit-line-periphery (BLP) with Storage Node Landing Pad (SNLP) are the most critical layers in terms of patterning difficulty level. The honeycomb array hole layer has the highest density among various hole array types, and it is a complex lithography step since this layer is key in determining the performance of the DRAM. BLP with SNLP includes hole type and bi-directional line/space (L/S) design, and industry is considering a single exposure solution, compared to a three-mask solution using ArF immersion [1]. This BLP layer of 10nm DRAM has 2 different types of pattern topologies, hole array and bi-direction line/space: it is a very challenging single exposure level. In this paper, we discuss patterning challenges that come as consequences of industry trends in DRAM cell size reduction [2,3]. To keep up with this trend and to propose a single mask solution for bit-line-periphery, storage node landing pads and aggressive cell array pitches are considered along with resolution enhancement techniques (RET) for high-NA anamorphic EUV (NA=0.55) lithography. This study uses computational lithography such as source mask optimization (SMO) to find optimal off-axis illumination and optimal placement of sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) on the mask whilst considering the manufacturing rules checks (MRC constraints) for anamorphic EUV masks. In order to achieve that, a screening Design Technology Co-optimization (DTCO) experiment is done. The purpose is to identify cell array pitches in between 24nm and 32nm which satisfy both scaling requirements and patterning fidelity, preferred orientation of layout, and mask biasing scheme for various cell arrays. Lithography metrics like common depth of focus (cDoF), exposure latitude (EL), image contrast, and image log slope (ILS) are used to decide what is optimal way to expose on wafer. For the sake of completeness of the study, mask materials are compared. Indeed, in EUV domain there is interest to use alternative mask absorbers like Ruthenium alloys as an alternative to Tantalum-based absorbers [4,5,6].", "The first high-NA EUVL scanner will have an 0.55 NA and will use anamorphic magnification. Therefore, the standard 10\u00d713 cm lithography mask will be imaged into a 2.6\u00d71.65 cm rectangle on the wafer due to the increased reduction factor of the lens\u2019 vertical direction. Layers exposed on high-NA anamorphic scanners will require two stitched halffields to achieve the equivalent exposure area of previous-generation scanners. Stitching strategies will depend on the product type being manufactured. For chips with a large die area, it will be necessary to stitch fields across the die. For smaller chips, it may be advantageous to use three stitched exposures depending on the die size. In any case, the stray light from neighboring fields and black border proximity effects cause challenges for robust manufacturing. Some recent studies have shown that the CD may vary significantly as a function of the proximity to the black border edge due to multilayer stresses. In addition, stitching through a die has increased optical proximity effects which will need to be corrected to achieve the desired wafer CD. In this paper we examine the effects relevant to designing a stitched process, quantify manufacturing tolerances, and show how these effects can be corrected with EDA. More specifically, we examine the optical and mechanical properties of the multi-layer black border etch and optimization of sub-resolution gratings to reduce reflectivity with phase shifting absorber materials. Ultimately, we will show that for a well designed stitch, the effects of stitching can be corrected without impact to process window.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) double patterning (DP) with a numeric aperture (NA) of 0.33 can be introduced for the critical via layers at 3nm logic node. The minimum center to center (C2C) distance of a via pattern may form bridging defects even adopting EUV DP. The implemented via process, pattern shifts induced by EUV illuminator, overlay capability and OPC strategies may lead to bridging defects in EUV DP process. This paper will put forth a compact model to detect potential bridging hotspots and predict the corresponding probability of failure considering aforementioned process variations. The feasible design, patterning solutions, and process parameters can be optimized and compensated quantitatively to avoid design updates and mask rebuild.", "This paper describes the direct print Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) technology used for lithographic patterning of ~30-36 nm pitch metal layers of Intel 18A technology node. Direct print EUV delivers cost effective pitch scaling to enable flexible design rules and ease of use for layout designers. Careful co-optimization of the illumination source, photoresist and lithography stack is essential to resolve the tightest pitches. Optimum CDSEM metrology conditions and EUV specific requirements such as full field correction with thru slit, flare and black border compensation are critical to improve the quality of the optical proximity correction (OPC) flows. OPC algorithms were used to maximize the process window by using width sizing and pitch shifting to meet lithographic printability criteria while pushing mask manufacturability constraints to their healthy limits. The sizing of metal lines is modelled and fed to the RC extraction flows to close the fabdesign house feedback loop to improve accuracy of timing closure. A novel directional etch process enabled the direct print patterning of line tip-to-tips without requiring a second blocking mask. Multiple test masks were specifically designed to increase sensitivity of defect metrology and accelerate yield learning. Our results from multiple product vehicles demonstrate achievement of technology readiness milestones.", "The introduction of the multi-beam mask writer has made it possible to introduce non-Manhattan shapes on photomasks with no write-time penalty compared to the standard rectilinear mask shapes. While it has been known for some time that removing the Manhattan restriction on OPC output not only allows for improved process window, more recently it has also been demonstrated that it improves mask CD uniformity (CDU). When crucial mask rules are followed, most notably a minimum allowable curvature, we assess the CDU changes at the mask level for an MRC-constrained correction, as compared to either Manhattan or unconstrained corrections. An AIMS analysis was performed to estimate the effect at the optical plane. Lastly, we contrast differences in the CDU as transferred to resist in EUV lithography. We conclude with a view as to the challenges left to enabling high-volume manufacturing of all-angle shapes.", "Modern semiconductor design to fabrication process mainly relies on intra-module validation mechanism to prevent the propagation of systematic defects, such as DRC signing off physical design, OPC Verification validating OPC solution, metrology and inspection gauging the process, and physical failure analysis confirmation of electrical diagnosis. The inter-module information exchange and co-optimization typically happen during the early process and technology development stage via Design-Technology Co-optimization (DTCO). Later into the advanced node\u2019s lifecycle, such co-optimization is facilitated by traditional techniques like Design For Manufacturability (DFM) and Litho Friendly Design (LFD).

There is an insatiable need for Flash storage. NAND is the most exciting semiconductor memory around with continued scaling. The capital intensity and competitive landscape continues to fuel many innovations in flash architecture and its applications. This talk will give a brief introduction to NAND architecture changes in 3D NAND flash as it continues its aggressive physical scaling by growing more layers. NAND scaling is expensive and capital efficiency is one of the key metrics to be considered. There are many innovations in 3D NAND architecture, with the ongoing drive to shrink die size and drive the NAND roadmap for the future. On the application side, we will look at zone named space (ZNS), a new system architecture that reduces the \u201cwear and tear\u201don flash memory and which also helps adaptation of 4 bits per cell (QLC) in SSD.", "Free-form ILT has the best lithography quality but suffers long runtime and large file sizes. The shortcomings can be mitigated by using spline-polygon curvilinear mask. Further more curvilinear OPC can be used to drive down the EPE, further improving the runtime and correction quality", "Curvilinear layout data has been used for better mask quality for ILT OPC results, but it has issues such as complexity, huge data volume and absence of established verification methods. In this presentation, fundamental and practical verification methods will be discussed for complicated curvilinear geometries. On top of that, real curve data (parametric curves) has been discussed to reduce the mask data volume. The MULTIGON record has been defined as the real curve expression. We will explain the characteristics of the new record and show the outlook about how the mask industry should deal with its complexity.", "With the adoption of multi-beam mask writing (MBMW) technology, there is a strong drive to realize the maximum lithographic process window entitlement which can be obtained with curvilinear masks, including both SRAFs and main features. Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) has always featured prominently in planning for such masks, as it can produce the ideal curvilinear patterns which represent the best possible solution. The runtime for ILT, however, remains too slow for full-chip logic manufacturing and this paper will review multiple alternative approaches which endeavor to produce similar output masks but with significantly faster runtime. Results will be shown for 3nm-node via and metal examples where full ILT, hybrid ILT & dense curvilinear OPC, hybrid curvilinear SRAF & dense curvilinear OPC, and machine learning approaches will be assessed for runtime and a variety of lithographic metrics. Overall, all solutions are shown to be considerably faster than full ILT, ranging between 4x (for hybrid ILT SRAF) to <100X improved runtime performance. Lithographic capability is characterized in terms of distributions of edge placement errors (EPE), PV Bands, and ILS/NILS. There are some minor differences between the various options, but given the pronounced runtime advantages over ILT, all are compelling options, delivering lithographic PW enablement close to the ideal ILT solution. For the model-based DNN, and Monotonic Machine Learning (MML) approaches, we will discuss the approach, challenges, and advantages associated with robust training to ensure the broadest possible pattern coverage.", "Vertical-Transport (VTFET) Nanosheet Technology is an attractive solution to enable aggressive CMOS scaling in the sub-45nm contact-gate-pitch (CGP) regime. By decoupling the classic tradeoff of S/D contacts, gate length & contactgate-pitch (CGP), VTFET technology overcomes middle-of-the-line (MOL) dominated performance pinch-points by providing independent optimization of the contact dimension & device width as well as significant effective capacitance (Ceff) reduction [1]. VTFET offers an attractive solution at sub-45nm CGP, however it introduces unique design challenges that need to be optimized to take full power-performance-area (PPA) entitlement. In this paper, we present for the first time a logic standard cell architecture to enable a competitive VTFET technology. First, we introduce key features of the VTFET architecture which enable significant advantages relative to leading-edge competitive technologies. Further we describe key Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) scaling knobs that naturally lend themselves to VTFET such as single fins, buried power rails and gate-contact super vias can achieve competitive area scaling vs. an industry 7nm lateral FinFET transistor reference. Finally, we draw conclusions of overall PPA benefits of this technology.", "Fin depopulation, thinner and taller fins, and the step towards Nanosheet technologies has been helping in maintaining the rhythm of the semiconductor technology roadmap. Nevertheless, further area scaling causes a drastic reduction in active width as well as a challenging routability. On this regard, the Complementary-FET is a strong contender as device for next generation technologies. The stack of p- on n-FETs offers several opportunities for device scaling and optimization. However, it also poses several challenges that need to be carefully analyzed in a design-technology cooptimization framework.", "For nanoimprint lithography (NIL), computational technologies are still being developed. Only a few simulators are applicable to the nanoimprint process, and these simulators are desired by device manufacturers as part of their everyday toolbox. In this paper, we introduce a new NIL process simulator which simulates the whole imprinting process, and evaluates the quality of the resulting resist film. To overcome the scale difference of each component of the system, which makes it difficult to calculate the process with conventional fluid structure interaction simulators, our simulator utilizes analytically integrated expressions which reduce the dimensions of the calculation region.", "Computational lithography is a critical research area for the continued scaling of semiconductor manufacturing process technology by enhancing silicon printability via numerical computing methods. Detailed topics include lithography modeling, resolution enhancements, optical proximity correction (OPC), and source mask optimization (SMO). In this work, we focus on 1) lithography modeling, which computes the post-lithograph shape on the silicon wafer given a mask design; and 2) mask optimization (inverse lithography), which optimizes a mask design such that the remaining pattern on the silicon wafer after the lithography process is as close as possible to the desired shape (\\Cref{fig:intro}). Today\u2019s solutions for these problems are primarily CPU-based and require many thousands of CPUs running for days to compute the masks required for a modern chip. We seek AI/GPU-assisted solutions for these two problems, aiming at improving both runtime and quality.", "EUV lithography has been ramped to successful volume manufacturing through a combination of improvements in process technology, layout design and device interactions, and also optimization of the overall product integration to reduce undesirable interactions. Because EUV has additional sources of systematic and stochastic variation that did not exist in DUV lithography, it is now even more important to have accurate predictive capability to test and understand the design and lithography process interactions. EUV-specific physical behavior such as shadowing, flare, mask topography (i.e., Mask3D) effects, mask stack reflectivity, mask absorber behavior and other effects are key differences in how EUV forms an image on the mask and subsequently on the wafer. The reflective mask substrate and EUV-specific mask absorber stack are therefore highly important technologies to optimize as the industry pushes both low NA (0.33NA) and high NA (0.55NA) technologies to cover the patterning requirements of upcoming 3nm and below technology nodes. Recently there have been substantial industry interest in optimizing EUV mask stacks to further enhance imaging behavior and achieve better pattern resolution, increase process window, lower stochastic defectivity and optimize flare. Several different options have been proposed for these new EUV mask stacks for lower K1 EUV patterning. All of these new options require excellent simulation accuracy in OPC, SrAF placement, OPC verification and ILT mask synthesis steps in order to realize the benefits of the new mask stacks. In this paper we will focus on analyzing and improving the accurate prediction of a range of new EUV mask stack options for full-chip OPC/ILT compatible compact models. We will show for advanced mask designs the accuracy requirements and capability of leading-edge compact models. The accuracy requirements and capability will be referenced to fully rigorous electromagnetic solver (e.g., Mask3D) results to ensure industry needs are met. We will also explore the mask stack options to highlight the imaging benefits for different material thickness, refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) on important mask pattern feature and layer types.", "For advanced technology nodes, leading edge mask fidelity is ensured by applying a mask error correction (MEC) solution that mitigates the distortions caused by the many proximity effects present while manufacturing these masks. The centerpiece of the MEC solution is a compact model that captures these systematic effects and allows the accurate prediction of the printed signature on the mask for any layout slated for the process in consideration. In addition, time and resources constraints at the fab dictate that the model must be efficient enough to make the actual step of correcting the mask a fast and practical one. The introduction of advanced modeling schemes based on machine learning is providing new dimensions for the exploration of this perennial balance between accuracy and speed, including in the context of lithography mask models. This has been a focus of development at Synopsys as multiple routes have been implemented, with promising outcomes for mask model accuracy and correction turnaround time (TAT) performance. This paper provides examples of the improvements as well as comparisons between the different approaches, showing how deep learning can be leveraged to significantly increase mask model accuracy while keeping simulation and correction TAT within acceptable limits.", "The EUV High-NA scanner brings innovative design changes to projection optics, such as introducing center obscuration and the anamorphic projection optical system in the projection optics box (POB) to improve the system transmission while the NA is improved1 . These design changes need to be accounted for in the computational lithography software solutions, to ensure accurate modeling and optimization of the High-NA system performance on wafer. In this paper, we will systematically investigate the benefits of Source Mask Optimization (SMO) and mask only optimization to explore EUV High-NA full chip patterning solutions, where mask 3D effects (M3D) are captured in the optical modeling. The paper will focus on assessing the performance (including process window, depth of focus, normalized image log slope) of through-pitch 1D Line/space (L/S) patterns and 2D Contact/Hole (CH) patterns after aforementioned optimizations and demonstrate the impact of center obscuration on imaging. In addition, we will investigate the effect of sub-resolution assistant feature (SRAF) on High-NA patterning via comparing the optimized lithographic performance with and without SRAF. These findings will help determine the most optimal patterning solutions for EUV High-NA as we move towards the first High NA EUV insertion. The paper will also discuss the anamorphic SMO where MRC and mask description needs to change from wafer plane (1x1) to scaled reticle plane (1x2). The interfield stitching will also be briefly discussed in this paper.", "This paper presents a feasibility study on patterning the critical layers of Bit-Line Periphery (BLP) and Storage Node Landing Pad (SNLP) for advanced 10nm node DRAM with sub-40nm pitch using a single EUV patterning. Source Mask Optimization (SMO) and aerial image-based Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) were initially conducted to classify image data and identify potential weak points of the primary patterning mask. A secondary patterning mask was then produced based on the resist model and design split using the obtained data on the primary mask to address these issues. Results obtained through PV-band and intensity analysis of each area in simulation, as well as ADI and AEI (After Etch Inspection) using photoresists with 2 kinds of different tones (PTD CAR and Spin-on MOR PR), demonstrated the feasibility of patterning BLP and SNLP with a single EUV mask. Additionally, Process Window Discovery (PWD) wafers were fabricated to analyze and review process margins and potential weak points through KLA inspection for systematic patterning defectivity. Furthermore, our experiments confirmed that the performance of EUV patterning with DRAM BLP/SNLP layer can be expected to improve by reducing the dose (in mJ/cm2) by approximately 30% using a secondary mask by retarget bias split and resist model OPC.", "As the semiconductor manufacturing technology node scales down in the deep submicron domain, hotspot detection becomes more challenging and geo-contextually dependent than ever before. The need to profile IC layout patterns based on geometrical commonalities becomes a significant demand either during IC layout design or manufacturing phases. Identified hotspots during the manufacturing phase are usually correlated to specific geometrical configurations sensitive to the lithography process or other manufacturing processes. Accordingly, identifying similar geometrical configurations is an important step toward locating potential hotspots. Once these hotspots are identified, their patterns can be provided to the router to avoid using these patterns and find other valid alternatives. Furthermore, in the IC design sign-off phase or Design Rules Check (DRC), layout profiling can identify patterns with high commonalities to these problematic patterns that potentially lead to a yield loss. In this paper, we introduce automated IC layout patterns topological profiling approach using Directional Geometrical Kernels (DGKs) to capture the context of patterns around a Point-Of-Interest (POI) in an IC layout, such as a hotspot.

Here, we discuss several methodologies, including both pre-PDK and post-PDK, to benchmark the integrity of power delivery network designs with advanced technology features such as vertical FET (VTFET) transistor architecture, skip-level vias, buried power rails and backside power delivery. For a post-2nm node VTFET architecture, we employ a pre-PDK benchmarking to find that buried power rails can reduce gate delay by as much as 30%. For 5nm and 2nm technology nodes, we use existing PDKs to simulate backside power delivery networks (BS-PDN) and find that scaled logic area can be reduced by 10-30% while minimum-pitch interconnect RC delay can be reduced by as much as 70% depending on reference design.", "Design for Manufacturability (DFM) in-design fixing methodologies are developed to improve Manufacturability Aware Scoring (MAS). Two methodologies have been evaluated. For the first methodology, DFM recommended rules are inserted in the reference flow for rip-up-and-reroute, thus fixing DFM rule violations, improving the MAS score. For the second methodology, pattern classification is used to classify the recommended rules into patterns based on the profiling of multiple layout designs. A library of fixable patterns with corresponding fixes is built. The pattern library is then inserted in the rip-up-and-reroute flow to fix the DFM rule violations, improving the MAS score. The methodologies are demonstrated on 28nm technology. Results show an average fix rate of 89.1 % for a design with a core utilization of 0.6 and 78.4% with a core utilization of 0.6 for three DFM MAS enclosure rules, VIA2, VIA3 and VIA4 layers.", "Integrated circuit performance has been limited by transistor performance for many process nodes. However, in advanced nodes where pitches reach 10s of nanometers in size, there is an increasing probability of cases where circuit timing may be limited by the resistance and capacitance of the device rather than the transistor. This means that metal layer patterning may have implications on device performance beyond reliability, shorts, and opens. Lithography variation can be effectively predicted using stochastic simulations, including layer overlay. Simulating many patterns stochastically produces insight into the performance of the lithography process over time. Etching and metallizing the pattern set in simulation then allows the study to extend to electrical simulations. The combined lithography and electrical simulation data can then be used together to improve process or pattern performance before constructing a reticle. These data also allow the engineering teams to address resist and capacitance issues that may impact device performance prior to tapeout. This paper will investigate the metal layers of a structure designed to emulate an advanced node logic circuit that uses a CFET transistor. The structure will be corrected with OPC, and each layer will be simulated to generate a large (100) set of stochastic patterns at multiple process conditions in focus, overlay, and exposure. Each of these patterns will then be etched in a modeled process and metalized with copper. Finally, resistance and capacitance measurements will be generated from circuit simulations. The output data will then be used to update the lithography process or the pattern to improve through process performance including electrical characteristics.", "For the past few decades, PPA (performance, power, and area) demand of computation infrastructure has been driving exponential increase of chip density. In recent years, the challenges of printability and process window for advanced manufacturing node continuously motivated innovations in reticle enhancement techniques, notably the adoption of inverse lithography technology (ILT) and curvilinear mask. We have observed a few challenges: 1) ILT provides unmatched quality of results but does incur additional computation time to manage; 2) for curvilinear mask, though the benefits are evident, the associated data volume is very large; and 3) mask consistency remains a critical component for design manufacturability. To utilize the advanced RET techniques to their full potential, it is crucial to identify the repeating structures in design layout and reuse the correction result, getting three benefits at the same time: reducing mask preparation runtime, reducing mask data volume, and improving mask consistency. Conventional layout repetition analysis is based on native design hierarchy. However, in many cases, the input layout for mask synthesis flows is either completely stripped of hierarchy or contains sub-optimal hierarchy. Some layout hierarchy can be detected and reconstructed using manual methods such as using user generated pattern library of highly repeating structures in conjunction with pattern matching technology. However, the preparation of such libraries is a formidable effort, and a significant number of repetitions in designs will be overlooked by this approach. In this paper, we investigate the automatic detection of repeating geometry structures and formed a hierarchy that is optimized for mask synthesis. The detection supports any process layer and both Manhattan and all-angle designs. The engine detects repeating regions of arbitrary shape. The detected repeating structures can also be applied within the chip or across chips to accelerate correction to further improve mask consistency. By scaling well to hundreds of processors, the distributed hierarchy extraction is very efficient for a full chip layout. For highly repetitive layouts, mask synthesis runtime reduction of more than an order of magnitude has been observed by performing this hierarchy extraction.", "Fine-pitch 3D integration is considered a promising way to advance traditional CMOS scaling as 3D interconnects are currently capable to match the connectivity among functional sub-blocks of a system, enabling their displacement on different tiers. A major bottleneck for 3D ICs is represented by the power delivery, due to the challenge of supplying multiple dies. This work aims to provide insights into the system-level impact of PDN in a 3D chip, in terms of frequency and IR drop. A highly-interconnected memory-dominated SoC is physically implemented using the same 2nm technology in 2D and 3D. For both options, the results are compared with an ideal PDN-less implementation, showing that 3D-induced frequency (up to 9.3%) and wirelength (\u223c 10%) benefits are retained upon PDN insertion. From the power integrity perspective, a \u223c 60mV dynamic IR drop improvement is observed in 3D, compared to a conventional frontside PDN in 2D, when considering the 90th percentile of a cumulative distribution function. This work validates the expected technology-driven benefits of 3D integration at the system physical design level, in a realistic environment including a 3D PDN.", "Sequential and monolithic complementary FET (CFET) have become the most attractive device options for continuing the area scaling of SRAM beyond 5-\u00c5-compatible technology (A5). The stacked architecture of CFET has eradicated the need for PMOS and NMOS (PN) separation and thereby enables cell height scaling of 40% compared to 10-\u00c5-compatible technology (A10) forksheet (FS) SRAM. However, the routing becomes challenging with aggressive area scaling. This work proposes interconnect designs for A5 CFET SRAM and explores process integration options for corresponding solutions.", "Technology evaluation of new nodes is becoming increasingly complex; where transistor performance was once the critical metric, technology evaluation currently requires more complex metrics such as AC power and area.

This workflow enables a much more accurate and complete picture of technology performance in a faster way than traditional PDK-based workflows.", "The demand for high-performance semiconductor products has increased with no end in sight since the early days of this industry. This product demand phenomenon has continuously pushed the technological frontier to a moving limit for enhanced performance leading to the need for an ever-thinner die for advanced 3D packaging. Die down to a thickness of 5 \u00b5m is feasible. The thin die approach may lead to a heterogenous stack of 50 dies, leading to the highest available performance with an unprecedented form factor. One significant barrier is the fragility of the thin die and its impact on yield, reliability, and costs. A comprehensive crack propagation and thin die fragility model that is rich in both theory and application is presented. In this paper, we show an MPW reticle placement with automation that inserts new and specific crack-stop patterns to mitigate the risk of die wafer fracture. We show this method to address die fracture from both the front and the back sides of the wafer, yielding an authentic 3D approach to crack-stop.", "In modern digital integrated-circuit designs, standard-cell libraries are key foundations. The increased leakage current, complicated design rules, and restrictive layout space make the task of designing standard cells meeting both electrical characteristic requirements and layout constraints a significant challenge. Transistor sizing can help determine an optimal set of transistor sizes of the standard-cell circuit under specified design constraints and desired circuit optimization goals. In this work, as a refinement of the existing approaches, a new method is proposed to find suitable initial values and reduce the electric characteristics deviation. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed method can be effective in 20-nm-grade standard-cell optimization.", "After large yield limiters are addressed during ramp, subtle layout pattern systematics continue to cause physical defects and prevent achieving entitlement throughout volume production of semiconductors. Current approaches are insufficient and require layout and location specific fallout information to further inform the pattern analysis engine. In this presentation we will describe a new approach to combine a pattern analysis engine (FIRE from PDF Solutions) with volume logic scan diagnosis (RCD from Siemens). The resulting yield Paretos include specific layout pattern systematic families as distinct root causes and show an overall increase in defect Pareto accuracy from ~70% to ~90%.", "Logic diagnosis attempts to identify defects within an Integrated Circuit (IC) using only a logical model of the design with no knowledge of the physical layout.

To provide increased a", "This paper presents a novel methodology called Design-for-Inspection (DFI) that enables sensitive inline pickup for failure mechanisms previously undetectable until product test (wafer sort, final test, HTOL) or field failures. Dummy filler cells are replaced in the physical design flow by DFI-enabled filler cells which are designed to be sensitive to specific failure modes without any area penalty. To achieve very high inspection throughput, we have developed a proprietary vector scanning eBeam Voltage Contrast tool called eProbe 250 which is capable of inspecting up to 5 billion Devices Under Test (DUT) per hour. Due to novel processing of gray levels the system is capable of detecting not only the hard defects such as shorts or opens, but also the soft failures, namely leakages and resistive contacts and vias. We illustrate this methodology by several examples from the most recent FinFET technology nodes.", "Semiconductor manufacturing\u2019s full chip RET/OPC operations rely on the process models calibrated against metrology data collected from custom designed test structures. Physics-based compact models and machine learning models inherently carry the issue of model coverage often synonymous with calibration test pattern coverage. Therefore, process models frequently fail to predict unseen patterns within error tolerance. With the push for advanced technology node, such events can even occur after a node is declared HVM ready. Foundries have been combating the model coverage deficiency through costly model revisions, or expensive repair flows. There has always been the desire to have capability to screen and enhance compact model of potential coverage issue. In this paper, we use the machine learning clustering platform to learn the signatures of the model calibration test patterns and then compare them to the new design patterns in terms of feature vectors\u2019 space correlated to model parameters\u2019 space. The comparison provides not only the locations of the new patterns but also the similarity ranking with respect to the reference pattern, so that those patterns can be included and be further analyzed for better model coverage. These patterns are often suitable candidates to be included into new model calibration set. In this application, full chip capability is also essential besides the accuracy of the learning. The full-chip pattern check needs to be done quickly and efficiently; hence this technology could be adopted for new chip screening, highlighting areas worth paying extra attention to during inspection.", "As the technology node scales down below nanometer, the design rules significantly increase, which in turn results in the huge search problems of the chip design with an early-stage technology. DTCO (Design-Technology Co-Optimization) becomes a key methodology in semiconductor industry to overcome the limitation of physical scaling and transistor density, and to improve performance and power efficiency [1-2]. However, DTCO induces huge increase of design spaces in physical implementation since chip designers should tune the technology related variables along with the conventional design variables at the early technology stage. ML (machine learning) is a powerful technique when tuning and optimizing such complicated parameters in technology and design [3]. Synopsys DSO.ai (Design Space Optimization AI) is an early innovator of ML (Machine Learning) in EDA (Electronic Design Automation) area, where the tool uses advancements of RL (Reinforcement Learning) to effectively search the massive design space for global near-optimal targets [4]. In this paper, we report DSO.ai applications on 3nm technology and designs, such as PPA (Performance-Power-Area) improvements in both HP (high performance) and HD (high density) libraries, NDR (non-default rule) routing on both clock and signal nets, LP (layer promotion), density control, routing wire and via cost tuning, and more. Furthermore, we utilize ML capability in searching and optimizing technology parameters, e.g., key design pitches and design rules, as well as design parameters, e.g., via/wire cost, placeholder densities, legalization and routing strategies, and other EDA settings, to maximize PPA metric and to minimize DRC violation. Our goal is to find the best values of the initial parameters from an early technology and design stages and to encapsulate them in RM (Reference Methodology) script to provide the designer with the mega switch in entire design flows. Parameter range (to be explored) and evaluation metrics (to score QOR) are defined, then DSO.ai explores search spaces and trains itself to minimize the optimization cost. Optimized parameter values are evaluated against the reference parameters to reproduce the benefit across various designs and technology collaterals. In this manner, different parameters can be optimized given design methodology. This iterative process can be extended to optimize all design technology parameters to maximize PPA on 3nm design technology and designs and beyond. Proposed approach applied to optimize achievable core area and improve max frequency, respectively. Design flow with ML-assisted parameter could reproduce improvement across the different size and different styles of the benchmark designs. Optimization for achievable core area could reduce -0.5% at cell-driven design and -0.6% at route-driven design. Optimization for performance could improve the frequency of +1.42% at cell-driven design and +1.43% at route-driven design in Samsung 3nm technology.", "To successfully transfer design patterns to wafer, it is essential to calibrate different types of models to describe the optical, physical, and chemical effects in chip manufacturing process. In recent years, there have also been active investigations of machine learning (ML) models to capture various aspects of semiconductor processes. As it is well known, model training time and model accuracy are heavily influenced by the input data. It is becoming increasingly important to provide highly efficient methods to automatically generate effective pattern samples from full chip designs. A straightforward approach, simple random sampling, can be highly efficient to generate effective samples for a homogeneous population. However, real world chip layouts are characterized by geometrical and lithographical feature distributions that vary significantly across the full chip design space. The complexity of the problem necessitates the adoption of a comprehensive set of approaches for sampling as well as flexibility in customizing the sampling strategy for various applications. In this paper, we investigate automatic layout sampling to optimize the coverage and diversity of patterns given the need for minimizing training sample size or other constraints, and therefore adopting various unsupervised learning techniques. The flow scales very well with computation resources to efficiently process full chip layouts. A simple, standard interface is provided for typical usage, but flexible programming APIs are available to customize the sampling strategy for advanced applications. Results demonstrate that the samples generated by this flow have increased diversity, which leads to significantly reduced model training time with comparable or increased model accuracy.", "Depth of focus reduction due to the increasing numerical aperture (NA) for High NA Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and decreasing feature sizes of the latest process nodes necessitate smaller resist thicknesses. Reduced resist thickness degrades scanning electron microscope (SEM) image contrast significantly due to a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is possible to improve SNR by changing the number of frames averaging or using higher resolution SEM images. However, these techniques limit high-throughput defect screening and can potentially impact the measurements due to electron beam damage. In this work, we present a deep-learning-based denoising method for sub-nm metrology. Power spectral density analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) reconstructed images shows the developed AI model is capable of denoising SEM images to provide comparable measurements such as line width roughness (LWR) that are only attainable with SEM images with higher SNR.", "Machine Learning (ML) based technologies are actively being adopted in the computational lithography domain. ML-based methods have the potential to enhance the accuracy of predictive models, speed up the run-times of the mask optimization processes and produce consistent results compared with the other numerical methods. In this paper, we present the result of an ML-based ILT application to an advanced DRAM contact layer for both core and periphery region. In our ML ILT method, golden mask layouts are generated by ProteusTM ILT tool for the sampled target layouts to obtain reliable training inputs, which are then used to train a custom-designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Various methods for generating feature vectors and neural network architectures are evaluated for optimizing training time and ML model quality. Techniques include applying PCA to image-based density vectors generated from layout clips to identify the principle components or using localized layout features directly for model training. Results show that for a sample size of 300k vias, the image-based density vectors versus localized layout feature vectors achieve similar correlation coefficients of 0.95 and normalized RMSE of 0.11, with a training time of 10+ hours versus 1+ minute, respectively.", "The development of optical devices requires the patterning of non-conventional shapes on the wafers [1,2,3,4,5]. In addition to the specific challenges related to the treatment of these curvilinear patterns, an accurate proximity correction must be provided. The Critical Dimensions (CDs) of such patterns are indeed around 100nm, which requires the implementation of advanced lithography processes, similar to CMOS microelectronics technologies. In order to develop a production compliant and robust OPC solution, we previously demonstrated the need for etch bias modelling [1]. Taking the example of optical metasurfaces application, and using ASML\u2019s Tachyon OPC+ platform, we will present the implementation of an OPC flow suitable for curvilinear patterns, starting from the metrology strategy. We will then discuss the etch model calibration methodology, model-based etch bias correction implementation in OPC, and global OPC performance.", "Numerous recent approaches have proven the efficacy of deep learning as a fast and efficient surrogate for various lithography simulation use cases. However, a drawback of such approaches is the requirement of large amounts of data, which is often difficult to obtain at advanced nodes. Different means to alleviate the data demands of deep learning models have been devised, such as transfer learning from different technology nodes and active data selection. Active data selection techniques tend to require large amounts of data to optimize and select.

However, our CNN architecture contains 70 M parameters, and the architecture itself could be applied to general mask patterns. In this work, we apply the same CNN architecture to mask patterns which mimic iN3 logic metal or via layers. Additionally, to study more general mask patterns, we train CNNs using iN3 metal/via patterns with OPC and curvilinear via patterns. In total we train five different CNNs: metal patterns w/wo OPC, via patterns w/wo OPC, and curvilinear via patterns. After the training, we validate each CNN using validation data with the above five different characteristics. When we use the training and validation data with same characteristics, the validation loss becomes very small. Our CNN architecture is flexible enough to be applied to iN3 metal and via layers.

Starting from 115 nm, lithography processes typically use OPC to resolve features acceptably. Advanced OPC technologies use model-based edge segment adjustments to achieve highly accurate corrections. The typical process for optical proximity correction suffers from a huge turn-around-time (TAT) and is well known to have time-consuming complexity especially at 40 nm and below. Therefore, in order to speed up process development and increase qualified pattern variations with good yield, we must find ways to speed up the OPC TAT. This paper presents a flow to construct layout hierarchy and increase OPC cell/template re-use to greatly reduce the OPC TAT using the Pegasus Computational Pattern Analytics (CPA) software.", "", "", "", "", "Accurate prediction of Jacobian is essential for multi-variable optical proximity correction (OPC). The Jacobian means the small variation of edge placement error (EPE) induced by small mask bias of nearby segments under optical proximity effects. If the Jacobian can be accurately calculated, it is helpful for OPC iteration reduction, or EPE improvement for 2D shape mask patterns. Moreover, if this can be cost-effective, this approach can be easily extended to Full chip level. We changed expensive Jacobian matrix procedure into simple ML based Jacobian model inference. Thanks to efficiently chosen geometric and optical features and light ANN structure, our method can predict Jacobian 76% faster and 81% more accurate than intensity distribution function method. We also improved mask optimization algorithm by inserting small gradient iterations. Our mask optimization solver was 2 times faster than vanilla mask optimization solver.

While fab expansion and capital expenditures continue to grow, the human element has become ever more demanding and prone to error. To assist with this issue, computer-aided process engineering, process control, and tool monitoring will continue to rise in the coming years. In this paper, we present an APC-integrated, customizable solution to an in-fab processing segment. Through machine learning, we combine information from design-specific extracted features with processing and metrology data to predict oxide deposition thickness. The result is a design-aware augmentation for current metrology that can recommend accurate process recipe conditions for new layouts. We also present experimental results highlighting the benefits of adding design-aware features with in-fab data to anchor and support each other across layouts and technologies.

It is derived through multiple lithography simulations of a mask pattern while optical settings such as dose and focus are varied. Quick estimation of PVB has been studied. A simple approach assumes optical settings for innermost and outermost PVB contour; it requires only two simulations, but the assumption of such optical settings does not always hold. We postulate that two sets of good custom kernels exist; one set for lithography simulation to extract outermost PVB contour, and the other for innermost PVB contour. Since lithography simulation can be mapped to a convolutional neural network (CNN) with kernels corresponding to convolution filters, each set can be obtained by training corresponding CNN with a number of sample reference contours. Our experiments indicate that the average intersection over union (IoU) between reference- and predictedPVBs reaches 97% with 0 PBVs having IoU smaller than 50%. This can be compared to the state-of-art of PVB prediction using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), where average IoU is only 89% with 12 PBVs having IoU smaller than 50%.", "", "", "", "Model-based optical proximity correction (MB-OPC) consists of fragmentation which is decomposed into segments and iterative simulations and corrections with a feedback system.

In addition to the construction of new fabs, CHIPS for America addresses the need for a resilient domestic microelectronics supply chain of materials and equipment suppliers, and a workforce trained for a range of technical capabilities. This talk will provide details about the rapidly developing CHIPS for America program, including the Research and Development Office, along with updates and some examples to illustrate the CHIPS vision for interaction with the semiconductor community.", "High-NA EUV lithography represents the next chapter in advancing Moore\u2019s Law. The relentless march toward progressively tighter geometries drives a reliance on pitch-division and multi-patterning techniques such as SADP, SAQP, SALELE, and others to overcome lithographic resolution limitations. Unfortunately, these approaches come with a cost in the form of extra lithography steps and increased process complexity. In technology nodes that are heavily dependent on pitch-division and multi-patterning, overlay control becomes extremely challenging, as tighter budgets are required to compensate for the additional sources of edge placement error and control of a current layer reticle to multiple underlayers is required. In recent years, the improved resolution of Low-NA EUV has helped to replace 193 nm immersion-based pitch division schemes with direct print, greatly reducing process complexity and thus providing a degree of respite for overlay control. However, as patterning requirements continue to tighten in accordance with Moore\u2019s Law, even the Low-NA EUV becomes insufficient for direct patterning of the required geometries, forcing a return to pitch division. Intel intends to avoid Low-NA EUV + pitch division and move aggressively to High-NA EUV lithography for production in 2025. Unlike previous generation lithography platforms, High-NA EUV does create some additional challenges for overlay control and this talk will be focused on addressing those items.", "Seeing an increasingly critical role of MI in the semiconductor industry, in this keynote, we will first review the evolution of the MI technologies in the last few decades, and then discuss the challenges we are presently engaging in, focusing on the EUV era metrology topics: thin resist, 3D and massive measurement.

The differences in the 3D sidewall shape before and after shrinkage have not been investigated in detail. In this study, EB-induced photoresist shrinkage was observed by employing the atomic force microscopy with tip-tilting technique (tilting-AFM), which enables high-precision observation of the vertical sidewall of the pattern. In the experiment, the shrinkage deformation was observed by measuring the same photoresist pattern with the tilting-AFM before and after EB exposure (by SEM observation) on the pattern. The results show that the sidewall was smoothed by EB exposure. Further, the tendency of changes in LER (roughness parameters) was observed. This measurement technique can be used to better understand photoresist materials and to improve the LER measurement by SEM.", "Shift happens due to electron beam tilt in scanning electron microscopy. To measure this aberration effect with submilliradian uncertainty, and to calibrate scale factor and correct scanfield distortion, we introduce conical frustum arrays as multifunctional reference structures. Our concept shows promise for new accuracy in scanning electron microscopy.", "With the growing adoption of EUV lithography in both Logic and DRAM, the stochastics associated with EUV lithography has highlighted the need for accurate line roughness metrology. One of the approaches suggested to reduce stochastic effects is to transition to MOR (Metal Oxide Resist) from the traditional CAR resists. The CDSEM is the primary workhorse used today to measure line roughness in an inline environment. However, it is known that roughness reported by CD-SEM is dependent on the image acquisition conditions and the metrology algorithm settings. On the other hand, SEM metrology for EUV now requires low landing energies to minimize resist damage and increase contrast on thin high NA EUV resists [3]. However, this combination of low-dose scanning and low landing energies significantly lowers the contrast of the SEM image leading to higher reported roughness values using traditional roughness metrology algorithms. To understand and reduce the dependence of roughness on SEM image noise, we acquired images with different imaging conditions on a post-etch wafer and thin-resist EUV wafers with different stacks. The focus of this study is to demonstrate a novel roughness metrology algorithm that reduces the sensitivity of image SNR to roughness compared to traditional metrology methods. In this paper, we provide comprehensive guidelines for measuring unbiased roughness on thin EUV resist wafers in terms of roughness metrology and scanning conditions. We hope this work can provide the basis for understanding the roughness transfer from litho to etch and better characterize EUV lithography.", "In this study, we applied the PointRend (Point-based Rendering) method to semiconductor defect segmentation. PointRend is an iterative segmentation algorithm inspired by image rendering in computer graphics, a new image segmentation method that can generate high-resolution segmentation masks. It can also be flexibly integrated into common instance segmentation meta-architecture such as Mask-RCNN and semantic meta-architecture such as FCN. We implemented a model, termed as SEMI-PointRend, to generate precise segmentation masks by applying the PointRend neural network module. In this paper, we focus on comparing the defect segmentation predictions of SEMI-PointRend and Mask-RCNN for various defect types (line-collapse, single bridge, thin bridge, multi bridge non-horizontal). We show that SEMI-PointRend outperforms Mask R-CNN by up to 18.8% in terms of segmentation mean average precision.", "For the most advanced nodes, edge placement errors are typically dominated by stochastics, necessitating a rigorous stochastics approach to modeling and measuring edge placement errors and their contributors. In this work, a new approach to developing an edge placement error (EPE) model useful for lot dispositioning or EPE budgeting is presented. Approach: As an example of the proposed approach, a rigorous EPE model is developed for the case of complementary lithography, where dense lines and spaces are cut with a second patterning step. This model gives rise to the generation of an Overlay Process Window, the range of overlay errors that can be tolerated in the presence of stochastics critical dimension and placement errors of the individual layers. The resulting model uses only measurable quantities and allows the prediction of EPE-based failure rates for the purpose of lot dispositioning. One interesting outcome is that Angstrom-level changes in the 1-sigma stochastics terms produces nanometer-level changes in the overlay process window. This new EPE modeling approach provides a more rigorous and accurate method for lot dispositioning and EPE budgeting than prior approaches.", "As EUV lithography transitions to high volume manufacturing, actinic photomask inspection tools at 13.5 nm wavelength are attractive for understanding the printability of EUV mask defects, as well as for in-fab monitoring for possible defects emerging from extended use. Ptychography is a lensless imaging technique that allows for phase-and-amplitude, aberration-free, high-resolution imaging in the EUV. Moreover, sources based on high harmonic generation (HHG) of ultrafast lasers are a proven viable coherent light source for CDI, with flux sufficient for rapid large-area inspection and small-area imaging. By combining CDI and HHG, we implemented actinic EUV photomask inspection on a low-cost tabletop-scale setup. Moreover, we propose and demonstrate a solution to the decade-long challenge of ptychographic imaging of periodic structures through careful illumination engineering.", "Optical Critical Dimension (OCD) spectroscopy is a reliable, non-destructive, and high-throughput measurement technique for metrology and process control that is widely used in semiconductor fabrication facilities (fabs). Wafers are sampled sparsely in-line, and measured at about 10-20 predetermined locations, to extract geometrical parameters of interest. Traditionally, these parameters were deduced by solving Maxwell\u2019s equations for the specific film stack geometry. Recently advanced machine learning (ML) models, or combinations of ML and geometric models, has become increasingly attractive due to the several advantages of this approach. Advanced node processes can benefit from more extensive data sampling, but this conflicts with measurement cycle time goals and overall metrology tool costs, which cause fabs to use sparse sampling schemes. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that allows wafers to be sampled sparsely but provides the parameters of interest as if they were densely measured. We show how such a methodology allows us to increase data output with no impact on overall measurement time, while maintaining high accuracy and robustness. Such a capability has potentially far-reaching implications for improved process control and faster yield learning in semiconductor process development.", "For CMOS image sensors fabrication, deep trenches are commonly incorporated in the device to isolate the individual pixel one another within the pixel matrix. These etched structures typically exhibit a high aspect ratio of 1:20 and controlling such narrow and deep object is a challenge for inline metrology. In a manufacturing environment, the preferred method for trench height measurements remains the optical scatterometry (OCD) technique as being very sensitive and reliable. Still, it requires time and resources for model construction and validation. It appears then that an analysis of its predicted sensitivity could be a valuable pre-step before starting any activity on large periodical objects where OCD sensitivity can reach its limits. In this study, we tested this approach for deep trench structures with CD dimension in the range of 100nm to 1400nm and the depth from 100 nm to 5 \u03bcm. The periodicity (pitch) was fixed at CD*2. At first, 3D Mueller scatterometry signatures were modelled selecting spectroscopic ellipsometry acquisition configurations according to industrial most common ones. Thanks to an optimized RCWA (Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis) code developed inhouse, calculation durations were reduced enough to allow massive data generation. By implementing a sensitivity analysis approach that uses Sobol coefficients, the sensitivity of the OCD metrology technique is here evaluated for each CD and depth values. More particulary, it will be illustrated by a CD range of \u00b110% of 350nm and with the depth of the trench varying from 100nm up to 5\u03bcm. As a results, a sensitivity frontier can be estimated at around 3\u03bcm, a critical depth value above which OCD in the given configuration is no more sensitive to the metrics determination. Such observation will be further discussed by analysis of convergence evaluation.", "A comprehensive picture of the stress evolution within arrays of through-silicon-vias (TSV) is developed using in-line Raman spectroscopy. A set of wafers with different TSV geometries and metal seed liner thicknesses is exposed to various annealing conditions. Monitoring the Si-Si phonon mode shift between the vias, the influence of via geometries and processing conditions on the stress in the Si substrate is characterized non-destructively. Compressive stress is found in close proximity to the TSVs post Cu fill, as expected. However, for arrays with small TSV pitches, the substrate does not fully relax in the space between the vias, but rather tensile stress accumulates within the arrays. This inter-via stress increases with decreasing TSV pitch, accumulates towards the center of the arrays, and strongly depends on the annealing conditions. High resolution Raman maps within the arrays reveal the full picture of stress distribution in the TSV arrays. By using different excitation wavelengths, the variation of the stress with depth in the Si wafer is probed. The findings demonstrate the value of in-line access to process-dependent stress information. This knowledge helps to define design ground rules for highest device performance or to maximize the useable area on the wafer for logic devices.", "A neural network-assisted spectral scatterometry method is presented to measure multi-dimensional critical dimensions (CDs) on high aspect ratio (HAR) structures with micron or submicron scales. With the rise of 3D integrated circuit packaging, there is a need for accurate characterization of HAR sub-micron structures. This method uses DUV scatterometry and a broadband light source from DUV to visible light to gather multi-channel reflection data. The inverse modeling method and artificial neural network model enable accurate measurement of multiple CDs of test structures. The results showed accurate measurement of deep trench critical dimensions with a nominal line width of 0.6 \u03bcm and aspect ratio up to 5:1, with accuracy within a few nanometers comparable to SEM results using the same sample.", "The adoption of tier stacking (dual deck) leads to increasingly high aspect ratios and poses challenges in controlling overlay, tilt, and misalignment in the manufacturing processes for next generation 3D NAND devices. In this work we address metrology challenges such as tilt and overlay separation, measurement robustness influenced by process variation, and nonlinearity of spectral response to asymmetries. We show that Mueller measurement can separate overlay and tilt signals through distinct spectral response analyzed by a machine learning method with reference data. To reduce asymmetry measurement errors caused by process variation such as critical dimension (CD) and thickness changes, we propose and demonstrate improvement of tilt measurements on blind test wafers by feeding forward CD measurement results to the analysis of tilt signal. We also investigate nonlinear regression and show its capability to extend overlay measurement limit from linear response range, \u00b10.25pitch, to \u00b10.43pitch. In addition, for small structural asymmetries introduced by channel hole tilt, test RMSE is reduced by 20\u201340% from nonlinear regression alone or combined with CD feed-forward. We demonstrate that spectroscopic Mueller matrix measurements, paired with advanced machine learning analysis, provide nondestructive and accurate measurement of tilt, overlay, and misalignment for 3D NAND devices with high throughput and fast recipe creation.", "A novel wafer edge quality inspection method based on analyzing curved-edge diffraction patterns is introduced in this paper. The diffraction patters, being collected through two approaches: (1) single point scanning method and (2) areal imaging method, are affected by edge topography, edge geometry and defects. After applying statistical feature extraction methods and wavelet transform to the collected fringe data, corresponding features of various defect modes were further extracted. In summary, both proposed methods enabled characterization and identification of various wafer edge defect modes and shed light on automatically wafer edge defects detection and categorization.", "During metrology overlay recipe setup typically a wide range of different target designs are present to select from. The main goal of recipe setup is to select the most accurate target type-recipe combination at ADI (after develop inspection) without additional external information that can be used for production on a large set of wafers. We will introduce a method based on blind source separation to disentangle the contributions of target asymmetry and the overlay of the targets. Based on this separation, the most accurate target-recipe combination can be selected. On top of selecting the most accurate target-recipe combination, it is important to stabilize the difference between the overlay on device and the overlay as measured on the target. In order to increase that stability we will introduce advanced algorithms in the ADI measurements that use measured asymmetry parameters to correct for inline target asymmetry variation. We will show a metrology to device matching improvement of up to 40% on product wafers.", "In this paper we have evaluated alignment and overlay for a Ruthenium Direct Metal Etch process. Depending on the integration strategy, line resistance and lithography requirements, a process with no remaining topography may be preferred from a lithography point of view, but due to the Ruthenium light absorption alignment and overlay through a thick Ruthenium layer will be challenging. In this paper we have studied the maximum thickness of Ruthenium for which the alignment sensor can still detect the alignment marks below and quantify the quality of diffraction-based overlay on an ASML YieldStar overlay metrology tool.", "The on-device and target-less overlay (OVL) measurement adds various challenges to the conventional target-based one.1 Most of the common solutions are based on the use of high voltage SEM to have a high resolution and see-through capabilities to see both layers entirely. To ensure repeatability and robustness the measurement is also generally realized on dedicated targets.2\u20134 Another approach is explored in this work : it consists of a direct measurement on the device itself, without any dedicated target and using a CD-SEM that do not have see-through capabilities. To avoid any damage on the final device and to ensure a partial vision of the bottom layer, the measurement is realized post etch. What can a true on-device, target-less, SEM overlay metrology reveal of the process? To answer this question, a custom design-based on-device CD-SEM overlay metrology was developed.5 It allows measuring the overlay on any bilayer 2D structure, even partially hidden, provided that sufficient edges are visible. Thanks to this post-processing capacity to measure on partially hidden patterns, the CD-SEMs from the current tool park can be used and non-transparent layers can be investigated. After demonstrating the capability of the previously mentioned solution on synthetic SEM images,6 by taking advantage of the versatility of the method and of an improved bilayer contour extraction algorithm, one product wafer was measured densely at different steps of the process on several patterns. These extensive measurements aim to reveal overlay signatures at different spatial frequencies: intra-field, intra-chip and even inside a random logic array. This paper details and interprets the observed overlay measurement with models while investigating the matching between the different measurement patterns and the mismatches with the optical overlay. To conclude, the contour-based metrology offers the capability to extract highly valuable information from CD-SEM images and represents a great opportunity for on-device overlay measurement. By measuring directly the products\u2019 patterns, the developed metrology shows a mismatch between optical and SEM measurements up to a couple of nanometers. A hybrid model, mixing SEM and optical measurements reduced by 15% the on-product residuals. Additionally, the local overlay variability could be evaluated and low amplitude chip signatures have been observed. This new information will help process engineers to improve the process characterization, leading to a better process control that results in an improved reliability.", "The advanced logic node is continuously shrinking toward sub-nm node and EUV lithography is the one of main drivers to reach better patterning resolution resulting in reduced process steps. Along with this design rule shrink, On Product Overlay (OPO) requirement has been critical to the device yield making the accuracy and stability of optical overlay measurement to become primary concern on the lithography process control. Historically Optical Microscope (OM) ADI overlay was accepted and the standard for control to meet OPO requirements. Along the past years, as OPO budget diminishes with node-to-node, OM overlay required additional supporting reference data to compensate the inherent accuracy problem. Industry adopted the accuracy correction knob with High Voltage SEM (HV-SEM) at post etch, also known as SEM AEI overlay. The SEM AEI overlay measures the error contribution of different process influence and the overlay mark to real device pattern overly bias together. The inaccuracy of OM ADI overlay has been treated as a non-correctable error components till the on-device overlay measurement of HV-SEM after etching was enabled to compensate the delta known as Non-Zero Offset (NZO) or Mis-Reading Correction (MRC). Today the HV-SEM on-device overlay measurement at AEI is widely adopted as one of critical component to meet the OPO requirement enabling scaling for all types of advanced CMOS devices production. The main driver of On-Device-Overlay (ODO) measurement at AEI step is the see-through imaging capability to see all relevant layers through the stack even though the measurement step/time differs on the same wafer of the ADI optical overlay measurement are ranging from few to two-digit days depending on the process complexity. There has been an increasing need for a faster response of overlay measurements to close the overlay control loop and breakdown the device to target error versus the process overly induce component \u2013 in other words, to correct in the right step. This leads to the necessity of SEM ADI overlay measurement. With the recent e-Beam evolution of more higher landing energy, probe current and improved Total Measurement Uncertainty (TMU) performance, SEM ADI overlay measurement is enabled and considered to show the performances to meet market requirements on the selected layers of interest. In this paper, we would like to demonstrate the enablement of SEM ADI overlay measurement including the accuracy comparison with OM ADI overlay on the DBO scribe target versus real device pattern measurement performance. With SEM ADI and AEI overlay measurement on the same patterns, we could also demonstrate the error breakdown between optical target to device and from ADI to AEI process induced error which will enable the better correctable methodology to minimize NZO/MRC. In addition, this process contribution to error breakdown could be extended to improve, in the future, the Edge Placement Error (EPE) control.", "In recent years, the overlay specifications of advanced semiconductor devices have become extremely stringent. This challenging situation becomes severe for every new generation of the device development. However, conventional overlay metrology systems have limited throughput due to their point-based nature. Here, we first demonstrate the novel imaging Mueller-matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry (MMSE) technique, which can measure the overlay error of all cell blocks on a device wafer with extremely high throughput, much faster than conventional point-based spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) technologies. It provides the super large field of view (FOV) ~ 20 \u00d7 20 mm2 together with high sensitivity based on Mueller information, which will be truly innovated solution not only for the overlay metrology, but also for critical dimension (CD) measurement, eventually maximizing process control and productivity of advanced node.", "Tool-induced shift (TIS) is a common method used to quantify measurement error or accuracy of an overlay (OVL) metrology tool and is often attributed to tool asymmetry issues. In a previous paper, we introduced Modeled-TIS (mTIS), a machine learning (ML) based algorithm to predict per-site TIS correction on Image- Based Overlay (IBO) measurements. Recently, we adapted mTIS to support the requirements of high-volume manufacturing (HVM) in 3D NAND production. During our work in an HVM environment, we observed that the mTIS model is sensitive to complex process variations and many tool states. Such variations can change the measurement distribution and deteriorate the mTIS accuracy and reliability over time. In this paper, we present an automatic retrain triggering mechanism (\u201cTrigger\u201d) to monitor and adaptively update mTIS. The proposed methodology incorporates statistical and unsupervised ML algorithms which automatically detect shifts in measurement distribution, and initiate data collection to continuously adjust the model to process variations and tool states. The proposed mechanism does not require periodic retraining but rather initiates data collection and model updates only when required. Trigger chooses the wafers which possess novel information reducing the number of wafers required for the training and time to the model, critical requirements for our customers. We demonstrate the mTIS results of Trigger on various 3D NAND layers running in production. Finally, our approach can also be applied to future ML-based solutions.", "In this paper the use of the EPE metric directly in the process optimization method for a DRAM use case has been researched.

Meanwhile semiconductor manufacturers see EPE as one of the main performance metrics enabling further shrink. In this paper we will give an update on the latest developments on EPE. Considering logic and memory use cases we will present evaluations of the EPE budget, including OPC model accuracy, overlay, CDU fingerprints for intra-field and inter field, overlay and local CD and placement error. The EPE fingerprint characterization is used to optimize scanner control for EPE performance on product. We will show how we can optimize the measured EPE fingerprints using scanner actuators.", "Variability control has been a key enabler for achieving continuing technology shrinks in both logic as well as DRAM. With ever-tightening requirements, simple one-dimensional metrology and control aspects, i.e. separate variability control for CD and overlay, are no longer adequate [1]. To improve on this approach, simultaneous control of more than one parameter has been discussed to minimize the parametric yield impact. One such example is to improve edge placement error (EPE), a metric where overlay and CD metrology are combined [1]. In this work, we will revisit the EPE concept from the perspective of using established methodologies used in yield modeling. Rather than starting with a litho-centric approach, we cast the problem as a parametric yield loss mechanism driven by patterning parameters. In contrast to the widely disseminated EPE budget that originates from a patterning process-centric view, we introduce a modified analysis framework. The development of the approach discussed in this work starts with well-known yield engineering approaches rooted in defectivity modeling/statistics. It then proceeds towards quantifying and thus allowing a statistically sound quantification and thus prioritization of patterning (i.e. litho or post etch) improvements based on their impact on the yield loss Pareto. In doing so, the new formalism sheds light on what aspects of the EPE distribution most prominently affects yield loss. It also reveals that the ratio of potentially failing instances with a die and the max number of fails tolerable before the die fails plays a role in formulating any kind of budget approach. When putting our concepts to the test we discovered that there is yet another significant contributor affecting the acceptable variation range. We find that the \u201crigid structure approach\u201d, an inherent assumption in any budget breakdown, and feature-to-feature interactions drive a significant reduction of the available processing tolerances. We attribute this mechanism to the 3D aspects of the patterning process and present a model that can handle the interactions. Finally, we discuss our approach to addressing the fact that process variability happens on length scales that cover several orders of magnitude. We developed a physical budget breakdown that attempts to optimize the tradeoff between sample size and the ability to capture variability over this wide range of length scales. We will postpone our discussion on other sampling-related topics. The question of how one obtains all required metrology data on one wafer in a manufacturing environment will be addressed in a future publication.", "", "With the continuous shrinking of semiconductor device nodes, the reduction of on-product overlay (OPO) becomes extremely critical for high-yield IC (Integrated Circuit) manufacturing. This requires accurate overlay (OVL) process control which can be better achieved by using an optimized OVL target design and a more advanced metrology platform. The novel rAIM\u00ae imaging-based-overlay (IBO) target, which has a grating-over-grating structure with significantly smaller pitch sizes as compared to the standard advanced-imaging-metrology (AIM\u00ae) target, can improve OVL measurement accuracy by adopting a more device-compatible design with high Moir\u00e9 sensitivity. This paper demonstrates the advantages of rAIM targets by comparing and quantifying their performance to standard AIM targets through key parameters including raw OVL, residuals, precision, and total measurement uncertainty (TMU). We also present the performance of rAIM targets on different OVL metrology platforms. We conclude that with an optimized target design and an advanced OVL measurement platform, rAIM targets can be an ideal overlay metrology solution for advanced dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) devices.", "The concept of using contours from SEM images for improving metrology results on semiconductor manufacturing applications exists for almost over two decades. However, the usage of contours was limited due to the difficulties encountered while identifying the contours and their consistency to be combined with traditional metrology results. As the technology for detecting contours advanced, so did the challenges, with higher levels of noise, lower contrast, more complex shapes, multiple layers combination, and tighter specifications. More recently, with the high level of sophistication attained by contour metrology, different applications and needs in different fields can be addressed by it. One of the most powerful benefits of using contour metrology is the possibility of combining information coming from the image to a layout, augmenting the metrology capability, pattern intent control and pattern quality. This work presents different strategies for obtaining contours from SEM images as well as multiple applications that are now relying on contours for either improving existing capabilities or proposing new ones that enable processes to continue to advance in future technology nodes.", "We are beginning projects to validate the physics models used for interpretation of electron microscopy images. In one of them, we will measure electron yields and energy spectra from cleaned well-characterized samples subjected to electron bombardment inside of a spherical retarding field analyzer in ultra-high vacuum. In another, we will measure the same features, lithographically patterned on free-standing Si membranes, with measurement techniques that differ in their interaction physics. A modeling project will compare measurement results with simulations using existing and new models. Good models should predict the observed yields and produce agreement among measurement techniques.", "CD-SEM is one of the workhorse metrology tools for evaluating the patterning performances in the semiconductor industry. With the continuous shrink of device feature sizes, measurement uncertainty, of such devices should improve accordingly, including tool-to-tool matching. Great efforts are made in fabs to ensure matching between CD-SEMs. Basically, there are two approaches : tool matching based on statistical CD measurements and tool matching based on physical tool parameters. The first methods require long recipe run on each tool for data collection while the second methods require dedicated maintenance tool time. In parallel, the emergence of SEM contour metrology brought new opportunities, for example in OPC modeling, process assessment or overlay metrology. Recently, a step has been made to demonstrate that offline SEM contour metrology can be matched with standard CD-SEM. In this paper we evaluate the possibility to use SEM contour metrology to perform a remote CD matching on images coming from two different CD-SEM. A large set of patterns of various dimensions and shapes (both 1D and 2D) is imaged with two different CD-SEM after etch process step. For each image the contours are extracted using a remote software. A matching model is calibrated to match contour measurements of the same pattern imaged with the two CD-SEMs. The matching model can be calibrated using either one or both inline SEM measurement or using additional metrology data (typically AFM measurement or any reference metrology measurement). The matching model parameters include both parameters for the contour extraction calibration and measurement matching parameters. Two modeling approaches are compared : one matching model averaging multiple measurement matching sites and a multiple (per pattern type) contour calibrations/ measurement matching sites model. These different matching models are assessed using as main metrics the remaining CD difference between SEM contour measurements on images coming from the two CD-SEM (\u0394CDmatching) and TMU analysis. We show that an overall \u0394CDmatching variability of 0.6 nm and a TMU below 2 nm can be obtained with the dataset. We evaluated a strategy to achieve matching of two CD-SEM using a remote contour extraction solution and a matching model.", "We investigate the limits of characterizing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) patterned features, highlighting Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscopes (CDSEM) and E-beam massive metrology techniques. Due to local CDU variation from EUV stochastic variations, there is increased need for multiple measurement sites in CDSEM or enlarged fields of view (FOV), leading to an increase in measurement time. Massive ebeam metrology techniques provide a robust method for imaging more features within a larger field of view. We assess the trade-off between accuracy and throughput in determining global and local CD variation. Via data sets, with matched parameters for each tool set will be analyzed at different process points to obtain local and global CD variation for statistical analysis of both techniques.", "In this work, important use cases for HV-SEM will be explored by simulation, such as HAR hole / trench imaging with various profiles and depths, buried feature imaging to understand detection and effective resolution with depth for optical overlay cases, and buried defect and void detection, using a new improved electron beam simulator which greatly extends utility of JMONSEL, AMAG SimuSEM, enabling many complex simulation scenarios to be achievable with many improved outputs and other augmentations. The use of simulation designed experiments (DOEs) to predict best conditions and performance for the above applications will be demonstrated, along with some physical validation in the HV-SEM process space for the JMONSEL/SimuSEM physics kernel by reproducing a few cases in the literature and to experimental results on recent AMAG7 HAR measurement targets.", "High integration of semiconductor processes is being made to realize high performance in miniaturized chips. The performance of a semiconductor chip may vary depending on target variables such as thickness, line width, shape, composition, and physical properties of each layer constituting the chip. Therefore, in order to secure chip performance, accurate detection of target variable values and quality control are required, and it is necessary to check in advance for defects that may occur during the process. Optical inspection technology is widely used in the semiconductor metrology field due to its advantage in that it can detect defects in the wafer at high speed by scanning the wafer with a light source having a specific wavelength band. However, in recent years, the size of defects caused by high integration and miniaturization of semiconductor chip processes is getting smaller, and thus there is a limit to detecting micro defects using conventional optical methods. In this study, we propose an algorithm to improve the defect detection performance by utilizing multi-scan images acquired under various conditions. Using the suggested algorithm, it was confirmed that the SNR (Signal to noise ratio) of the defect of interest was improved by about 99%, and the classification performance for noise was improved by 4 times.", "Non-destructive metrology for photomasks and wafers has always been an important requirement for semiconductor lithography, and with the advent of EUVL, enabling further shrinkage of semiconductor devices, the challenges in this field have increased significantly. Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) is a promising alternative to standard imaging for EUV photomask actinic inspection. EUV light can also be used for wafer inspection to benefit from the resolution improvement allowed by its short wavelength. In order to perform lensless imaging for patterned wafers, however, we need to probe the sample surface at grazing incidence to ensure a sufficiently high reflectance. The EUV reflective grazing incidence nanoscope (REGINE) at the Swiss Light Source was develped to perform grazing incidence lensless imaging for patterned wafers. REGINE is a tool that combines CDI, scatterometry and reflectometry in the photon energy range between 80 to 200 eV, and at the grazing incidence angle of 1 to 28 degrees. In this work, we will present the latest characterization of our system, and preliminary results.", "An innovative metrology technique has been devised to address current limitations of optical critical dimension (OCD) in advanced semiconductor metrology. This technique is based on multiple self-interferometric pupil imaging, called Mueller matrix self-interferometric pupil ellipsometry (M-SIPE). The system integrates an innovatively designed interference generator in both illuminating and imaging optics, allowing for the massive acquisition of full polarization information across entire angles around the device. The vast amount of information can offer fully comprehensive structural analysis, accomplishing enhanced sensitivity and the ability to break the well-known parameter correlation issues. The system employs a single-shot holographic measurement technique on the pupil plane, enabling rapid acquisition of three-dimensional spectral information, such as wavelengths, incidence angles, and azimuth angles. Thus, unlike conventional OCD tools, M-SIPE can obtain multi-angular and full polarization information without any mechanical movements. We verified the performance of M-SIPE by the experiment of non-patterned wafers of various conditions using an optical testbed. Our results confirmed good agreement between the experiment and theoretical simulations across all angular ranges. Furthermore, the actual device simulation was conducted to show sensitivity enhancement and ability for breaking the parameter correlation issues. The results confirmed that the large amount of angular information from M-SIPE technique could overcome current metrological challenges.", "In recent years, the number of manufacturing processes is increasing in pursuit of device pattern miniaturization. Complicated processes such as SAQP have been introduced, increasing the number of control parameters. Nevertheless, the demand for production yield enhancement is as high as ever. To detect CD changes, fixed-point measurement by using CD-SEM or scatterometry tools is typically performed, but these time-consuming measurement methods are not suitable for high-density, across-a-wafer measurement or for detecting CD anomalies that randomly occur. To address these issues, we have developed a technology that enables high-precision CD measurement of more than 100,000 points per wafer within a few minutes. It enables monitoring various CD defects in various processes such as holes and L/S patterns after photolithography, L/S patterns after SAQP/SADP, and fine hole diameters after etching. It can also measure CD imbalances after SAQP processes. In addition, it enables precisely obtaining intra-shot CD distribution based on the distribution over the entire surface of a wafer. We evaluated this technology using actual device wafers. CD imbalances of SAQP on DRAM process wafers were measured, within a few minutes across a wafer, at an accuracy of |X|+3\u03c3<0.5 nm. CD changes at the outermost area of the wafer were captured by CD measurement of 27 nm hole patterns on a DRAM process wafer. Random CD defects were captured by CD measurement of 38 nm hole patterns on a DRAM process wafer. These defects affect device yield but were not detectable by using conventional inspection tools.", "As High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (High NA EUVL) gets ready to step in the integrated circuit manufacturing (ICM) world, more and more work is being devoted to ensuring that all the elements involved in the process, from materials to equipment, will be ready to meet the required specifications when the time comes. One of the most critical pieces in such an ecosystem is the photoresist (PR), the material used to accurately transfer the design to the wafer. In the last years we have observed the introduction of various effective alternative approaches, such as dry metal oxide photoresist. PR always had to meet daunting specifications in terms of resolution, roughness, and sensitivity. However, in the brave new world of High NA EUVL, this is not enough. In fact, as the size of the printed features shrink, it is essential to limit the aspect ratio to avoid pattern collapse. Furthermore, the larger NA will reduce the Depth of Focus (DOF), thus requiring the use of ultra-thin resist films. The direct consequence of that is that the resist thicknesses used nowadays will not be suitable for High NA EUVL, where target thickness is expected to drop down to 20nm or less. Such a dramatic reduction in thickness has the potential to negatively impact, beside printing performances, the quality of the metrology and inspection as well, as discussed in our previous work. In the present work, we study the effects of reducing thickness in the case dry resist using various metrology and inspection techniques, such as Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope (CDSEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and e-beam defect inspection. As resist thickness decreases, noise level and image contrast are expected to be reduced, with a potential negative impact on the quality of the CD measurements both in terms of accuracy and precision.", "", "We present a tabletop EUV imaging reflectometer that can characterize the geometry and composition of nanostructures. The setup can be operated in multiple modes \u2014 intensity reflectometry, scatter-reflectometry, or imaging reflectometry depending on the length scales and periodicity of the nanostructures present. All these modes of metrology can be performed non-destructively and in a lab-scale setup, using a tabletop high-harmonic coherent EUV source.", "EUV resist is prone to damage (shrinkage) caused by electron irradiation during dimensional measurement using electron beam tool, such as CD-SEM. High repeatability and low shrinkage is demanded for metrology. In this study, we propose solutions that can reduce shrinkage and maintain performance of repeatability. We evaluated shrinkage of EUV resist using 100V low energy electron beam. Comparing to 300V electron beam, 100V beam enabled to shrinkage. Meanwhile, repeatability improvement was achieved by multiple proprietary solutions.", "This conference presentation was prepared for SPIE Advanced Lithography + Patterning, 2023.", "To enable the \u201cendless progression of Moore\u2019s law\u201d [1], traditional scaling has moved from sufficient to a mere necessary condition. In other words, the concrete implementation of high-NA EUV lithography remains among the top R&D priorities of the semiconductor industry for the coming years. However, the roadmap predicts that other scaling boosters, all putting a strong emphasis on the third \u2013 vertical - dimension, will also play a critical role in allowing increased functionality from a fixed surface area of Si. In this presentation, we first review the challenges imposed on metrology and inspection by 3D devices in the context of GAA, 3DIC and 3D memories. We then discuss our work extracting buried information of various nature, i.e. dimensional, overlay and defectivity, using less conventional metrology. Finally, we recommend stronger focus on 3D see-through metrology to ensure the readiness of metrology as devices move deeper into the 3D era. [1]L. van den Hove, SPIE ALP (2022)", "Several next generation integration schemes \u2013 e.g. for 3D stacked transistors, backside power distribution, and advanced packaging involve permanent wafer bonding steps and drive to sub-10nm overlay requirements post bonding. Distortion during wafer bonding is a major determinant of best achievable overlay between post to pre bonding lithography layers. Here, we investigate correlations between wafer bonding process and post bonding overlay performance through a combination of experiment and modelling. We use a custom test vehicle to collect wafer distortion data from pre- and post-bond processes, as well as overlay data after the post-bond processing steps (anneal and thin). The results establish direct relationships between incoming wafer distortion, bonder-induced distortion and post-bond lithography overlay to a pre-bond level. We also use the experimental results to validate a wafer bonding simulation model to further physical explanation of process-induced distortion. The experiment results will enable advanced wafer bonding process controls to optimize distortion and scanner overlay to meet technology targets. The results will also help guide hardware design to improve distortion fingerprints to best improve scanner overlay, as well as address the distortion challenges from incoming wafers.", "", "Global semiconductor packaging manufacturers are developing advanced process technologies with the rapid rise of heterogeneous packaging and 3D packaging. High-aspect-ratio (HAR) structures like through silicon vias (TSV) or redistribution layers (RDL) that come with the prevalence of 3D packaging technology have further significantly increased the difficulties in optical critical dimension (OCD) metrology. Due to emerging technical challenges, effective sub-micron HAR OCD solutions are highly demanded to resolve the technical bottleneck. Thus, This article presents an AI-guided method for simulating and building a training dataset using the finite difference time domain (FDTD), then forming a DNN model for reconstructing CDs. At the same time, an optical scatterometry-based microscope was developed to adopt optical light capable of penetrating a sub-micron opening size structure and characterizing critical dimensions such as top critical dimension (TCD) and depth. In the optical system design, the optical FOV can be narrowed down only to cover a single sub-micron structure for OCD metrology. A preliminary test verified that a single sub-micron structure with an aspect ratio of 1:3.3 and the maximum bias between the measured data and the SEM references could be kept within a few tens of nanometers for its depth, TCD, and BCD measurement.", "Wafer bonding is a key technology for many advanced chip technologies. For 3D integration, advanced stacking schemes and high-density packaging put a stringent requirement on the bonding reliability. Bonding quality can be characterized by the absence of voids at the bonding interface, as the voids delimit the complexity of the subsequent processing and integration steps. Therefore, in-line and non-destructive inspection techniques for void detection are crucial for early-stage detection and full process integration. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study on bonding void detection for 3D integration. We fabricate bonded Si wafers with programmed bonding voids with size from 10 nm to 20 \u03bcm. We combine different inspection and review tools, including acoustic, optical, electron beam etc., for bonding void detection at different process steps of the fabrication with different top Si thicknesses.", "Patterning defect metrology requires data interpretation with classification, each well-suited to machine learning (ML). Defect classification however has notable misclassification costs; mislabeling a defect as nominal has greater impact than the converse. Though quantified costs are not publicly available, total economic misclassification cost (total cost) is optimized across orders-of-magnitude variation in cost ratio C and classification threshold 0.01 < \u03c4 < 0.99. Convolutional neural networks are trained using the intrinsically weighted and scaled asymmetric focal losses (AFL, sAFL) with hyperparameter \u03b3 with weighted and unweighted binary cross-entropy (wBCE, BCE) functions trained for comparisons. Optimal functions and conditions are identified for reducing total cost. For reproducibility, publicly available ML data sets are surrogates for industrial imaging data. For these data the sAFL mimimizes total cost at \u03c4 = 0.5, C \u2265 16. The AFL reduces total cost at 0.1 \u2264 \u03c4 < 0.5, C > 128. Asymmetric loss functions lower total cost versus wBCE by 15 % to 40 % for 0.2 < \u03c4 < 0.5, C < 64. Total economic misclassification cost can be tailored using asymmetric focal losses. Estimations are presented to allow the extension of reported trends to industrial applications with strong class imbalances between defect-indicative and nominal-indicative data.", "Low-noise CD-SEM images are required in order to obtain robust and reliable measurement results, especially for complex 2D patterns. However, standard practices to reduce CD-SEM noise during image acquisition (increasing number of frames, increasing beam current, etc.) also increase acquisition time and the probability of deteriorating the materials under inspection. This effect is getting further attention of the industry on the case of EUV (extreme ultraviolet) resist, being an electron sensitive material and presenting small thickness, requiring extra care in order to prevent damage. Although there are techniques that intrinsically improve the metrology robustness to noise (such as model-based contour extraction), denoising SEM images may prove useful and a complementary approach for further improve metrology quality in such challenging cases. In this work we propose an innovative solution using Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) for low frame image denoising, which performs the model calibration using low frame images only, from a reduced dataset. A specific data augmentation approach is used in order to limit the number of images needed for the training. The denoising performance of the algorithm was evaluated in terms of accuracy and precision over a synthetic dataset, not used during the training of the neural network. The results show an improvement both in precision (up to 50% on the extreme case, 5% on average) as well in accuracy (over 13% on average).", "", "We developed imaging spectroscopic reflectometry (ISR) based on hyperspectral imaging and deep learning and built it as an in-line facility. After obtaining the reflectance as a hyperspectral cube of the 350 \u2013 1100 nm wavelength region throughout the whole device wafer, dimension of the nanometer-sized structure can be imaged through the supervised learning model. In particular, by including near-IR region in the spectrum, the bottom critical dimension (BCD) of the high-aspect ratio structure such as channel hole (CHH) of the 3D NAND evaluated in this study can be imaged non-destructively and rapidly. After removing the top through decapsulation, the actual BCD was measured by SEM and was linked to the hyperspectral cube to construct a supervised learning model. The BCD predicted through ISR showed a correlation of R2=0.72 with the actual BCD. In addition, the shape of the defect on device chip caused by insufficient etch at the bottom of CHH, obtained by ISR was identical to the inspection image taken after decapsulation. Compared to spot measurement, ISR shows the advantage of being able to capture defects that occur at random locations in the device wafer. From our high volume sample of 3D NAND, ISR result showed a high correlation (R2 = 0.82) with the rate of failure caused by channel hole while the conventional spot measurement showed only R2 = 0.41. By using ISR, we could optimize the etching process for the wafer edge area where CHH formation is particularly weak.", "An AI-assisted computational method is developed to achieve superresolution imaging by overcoming the limitations of optical imaging caused by the diffraction limit. The method builds and fits a parametric optical imaging model by resolving an inverse problem. Highresolution imaging often requires a high-magnification lens, but this reduces the field of view. The transfer function of the imaging system is parameterized using diffraction theory and simulations of real imaging disturbances. \"Known sample\" and corresponding \"Measured image\" pairs are used to train the model and fit the real transfer function of the system. A deconvolution algorithm is applied to resolve the reverse problem and maintain high resolution under an enlarged field of view. The spatial resolution can be improved by 2.33 times compared to the diffraction limit. This method is useful for semiconductor critical dimension metrology in automated optical inspection.", "The semiconductor manufacturing process is becoming more complex and time-consuming due to smaller design rules and denser patterns, which inevitably leads to an increase in the number and types of defects. In the past, considerable efforts have been made to classify defects, and this has been implemented at the equipment level. However, in order to enhance the efficiency and productivity of semiconductor process development by automatically classifying random, systematic, and parametric defects according to various process schemes and structures, there is a need for a deep learningbased automatic defect classification technique with a higher degree of freedom and utilization. In this study, we used not only scanning electron microscope images, which have been actively studied, but also optical inspection images at various scales. Deep learning algorithms were evaluated for various layers of memory devices to select the optimal algorithm for each layer, and an accuracy of 94% or more was achieved, even with a small sample size (under 1000), which is critical in the R&D stage. It is expected that this technique will be able to spread and be applied to more diverse layers in the future. By providing faster and more diverse classifications of defects in semiconductor manufacturing processes and ensuring higher consistency through continuous sample size expansion, it is anticipated that this technique will contribute to shortening the development period and improving yield.", "Due to their increasingly complex 3D geometries, upcoming gate all around (GAA) devices pose new metrology challenges for which there is not yet any established HVM metrology solution, in particular for various critical timed etch steps [5]. Soft x-ray (SXR) scatterometry using 10-20 nm wavelength light is a promising next-generation metrology technique for 3D profile metrology and overlay (OVL) applications. This wavelength regime offers unique benefits over existing metrology techniques today: (1) Short wavelengths allow for higher resolution measurements than traditional visible wavelengths could offer, enabling measurement of structures at device pitches. (2) Primarily single scattering yields low correlation between parameters and aids physical interpretation of signals. This enables many parameters of interest to be extracted accurately and simultaneously. (3) SXR provides 3D capability, with stack heights up to 400 nm supported and high depth resolution due to the broadband source and sensor. These properties together make SXR suitable for measuring the 3D profiles of advanced devices such as gate all around (GAA) transistors, as well as after develop (ADI) overlay at device pitch. In this paper, we demonstrate SXR for profile metrology of GAA devices. We show sensitivity to average SiGe lateral recess etch depth as well as individual nanosheet critical dimensions, which cannot be reliably accessed by other nondestructive, inline metrology techniques available today. We furthermore demonstrate sensitivity in ADI OVL measurements directly on device-pitch structures in the presence of an underlying patterned nuisance layer.", "X-ray fluorescence techniques in special operation modes can provide valuable quantitative insights for semiconductor related applications and can be made compatible to typical sizes of homogeneously structured metrology pads. As their dimensions are usually in the order of several 10 \u03bcm per direction, it must be ensured that no adjacent regions are irradiated or that no x-ray fluorescence radiation from adjacent areas reaches the detector. As this can be realized by using small excitation beams, a multitude of information can be retrieved from such XRF data. In addition to elemental composition, including sensitivity to sub-surface features, one can derive quantitative amounts of material and even dimensional properties of the nanostructures under study. Here, we show three different approaches for studies related to semiconductor applications that are capable to be performed on real world dies with commonly sized metrology pads.", "Critical Dimension (CD) control is essential in the semiconductor industry and becomes more challenging as photolithography limits keep getting pushed to reach technological nodes smaller than 10 nm. To ensure quality and control of the processes, it becomes necessary to explore new metrology techniques. In this sense, Critical Dimension Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (CDSAXS) has been identified as a potential candidate to determine the average shape of a line grating with a sub-nanometric precision. In this paper we benchmark the CDSAXS results to Optical Critical Dimension (OCD), Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscopy (CDSEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) measurements previously collected from industrial metrology tools at manufacturing line and in characterization laboratory. Emphasis is placed on the model used for CDSAXS and how to improve it. We discuss the differences between all these multi-scale and multi-physics techniques, and question our capacity to compare them.", "We present a reconstruction of the in-depth profile of line gratings using critical-dimension grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering with a compact Cu-K\u03b1 x-ray source mounted on a laboratory SAXS. By taking advantage of the grazing-incidence configuration and with a rotation of the gratings under the x-ray beam, several orders of the Bragg rods were probed and lead to the extraction of the in-depth profile of the lines. The extracted in-depth profile is compared with 3D-AFM results. The methodology developed mimics the one of CD-SAXS measurements, in transmission, in order to enable future comparison between the two approaches as well as building complementary modeling. These results open new perspectives for x-ray metrology at the fab since the Cu-K\u03b1 x-ray source is the most developed, spread and used source by the x-ray community.", "EUV scatterometry can retrieve geometrical information from nanoscale grating structures through elastic scattering of EUV radiation and the evaluation of the diffraction intensities. Its geometry and energy range place it in between grazing incidence x-ray scattering (GISAXS) and optical critical dimension (OCD). PTB recently commissioned a new scatterometry setup for the EUV and soft x-ray region that can address sample areas below 100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm size by using a comparably steep, grazing angle of incidence of up to 30\u00b0. At the same time, the full cone of exit angles of 30\u00b0 can be detected such that also the higher orders can be recorded in scatterometry measurements. It has been commissioned at PTB\u2019s monochromatic soft x-ray beamline at the synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II and can also be used for simultaneous x-ray fluorescence detection. Its great tunability and energy resolution allows to scan across absorption edges of the relevant semiconductor materials to increase the contrast between different materials. The nanoscale geometry of modern transistor designs features different materials and structure sizes in the single digit nanometer range.

The geometrical reconstruction of these structures relies on precise measurements, modelling of the scattering process, and statistical data evaluation methods.", "In order to minimize wafer loss and increase productivity, it is important to predict the wafer yield drop caused by defects in early manufacturing stage. In conventional yield prediction method, the chip failure was manually checked using images sampled by defect inspection. However, it is insufficient to predict yield accurately since the prediction was performed with only a few sampled defect images. Furthermore, the kill-ratio per defect was not estimated properly because the electrical properties were not considered in predicting a failure such as short or open. In this paper, we propose a new yield prediction method using defect and layout information with the following two characteristics. We tried to overcome the existing sampling limitations by using the defect inspection raw data that contains the coordinates and size information of all defects. In addition, we matched the electrical signal information of the layout pattern with silicon directly and then calculated the kill ratio per defect. The kill ratio per defect has doubled from 30% to 70% applied to sub-20nm Emerging memory devices. And we have confirmed that the yield prediction gap, which is the difference between the predicted yield and the actual yield, decreases from 31% to 8%. It is expected to reduce wafer loss about 10% in Emerging memory devices and same improvement will occur in other products such as DRAM, FLASH, and LOGIC devices by applying this sophisticated methodology.", "E-beam inspection based on voltage-contrast defect metrology has been widely utilized for failure mode analysis of memory devices. Variation in E-beam image contrast indicates shorts, opens and void defect inline inspection in the idle of production line. Meanwhile, accurate measurement of threshold voltage and the source-drain current is required to characterize memory cell through multi-layers. However, in the subthreshold region of memory cell, voltage contrast (VC) is weakened due to gate voltage stimulated by electron dose of e-beam scanning. We developed a modulated beam imaging with the SEM vector scan system to enhance VC contrast and defect inspection capability. Reliability of the modulated electron microscopy is validated by comparing with physical probing test result for process variation of Boron doping and annealing conditions in full wafer processing. VC with the modulated electron microscopy is well correlated to the probing test result. Image contrast of the modulated microscopy can differentiate contact via on floating circuit and disconnected floating circuit. We applied the modulated electron microscopy for in-line electrical defect detection at the middle of manufacturing line of integrated circuits. The defect distribution map by the modulated electron microscopy was confirmed to reproduce the physical probe test result. By achieving in-line electrical characterization before back end of line, yield loss issues can be detected and characterized two weeks earlier than conventional method. Moreover, this ability to detect and characterize memory cell issues inline is supposed to contribute to overcome the yield learning cycle bottleneck.", "Process window qualification using focus-exposure wafers is an essential step in lithography and a key use case for CD-SEM metrology. An automated analysis using the correlation between CD and focus/dose is easily possible but rarely done due to missing safety checks. Pattern fidelity that is analyzed by eye and problematic focus/dose conditions that may cause pattern degradation are excluded by hand. Specifically, when EUV lithography is utilized for exposing the most critical layers, roughness estimation becomes much more important, as it will restrict the process window further. We develop and describe unbiased and stable roughness estimates for contact hole patterns and integrate them into the process window analysis pipeline and inline monitoring routine. The analysis goes beyond simple roughness values and can detect a variety of possible CD-SEM measurement problems and shape deviations as well. Furthermore, we introduce a novel image-based machine-learning approach to detect outliers and quantify defective or abnormal patterns. Notably, the underlying model does not require knowledge of the types of CD features or design information for which outliers should be detected. We demonstrate that the approach can reliably detect local defects and a variety of other pattern anomalies. Using the generated visualizations, images with anomalous features can be flagged automatically and the locations of the defects or deviations are pinpointed. The approach yields not only the final missing piece in automated process window qualification, but also new opportunities to monitor pattern fidelity in lithographical semi-conductor processes.", "This conference presentation was prepared for SPIE Advanced Lithography + Patterning, 2023.", "As design rule of device shrinks quickly, process controls of HAR (high aspect ratio) buried defect become very crucial. In the past, monitoring of this defect mostly depended on e-beam inspection and destructive inspection. These methods cost a lot and need more time to prepare. So, optical inspection has been requested continuously. However, there are several technical obstacles, such as severe noises from under layers and quantification of defect height. In this study, we developed novel depth quantification technique for HAR structure. By using this new technique, we drastically improved (x240% higher) sensitivity of not-open defect. Light budget was rigorously analyzed and optimized for best SNR. To design deliberate non-destructive height quantification technique, we are currently working on development of TSOM (Through-focus Scanning Optical Microscopy) technique for HAR defect.", "Semiconductor complexity continues to increase with each new process node as the industry pushes the limits of 2D logic and DRAM scaling using EUV lithography and transitions to intricate 3D architectures including Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors, high-aspect ratio DRAM and 3D NAND memories. This complexity creates significant challenges for process engineers. Defects become much more critical and difficult to detect as chip patterns shrink, the use of 3D structures proliferate and the number of layers increases. The ability to detect and characterize tiny, buried defects in emerging logic and memory chip designs is surpassing the imaging capabilities of conventional eBeam technology. In short, you can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t see. This is where cold field emission (CFE) technology comes in. Long regarded as the optimal eBeam technology, CFE operates at room temperature, resulting in narrower, higher-energy electron beams that produce higher resolution and faster imaging speed compared to conventional thermal field emission (TFE) technology which operates at temperatures exceeding 1,500 degrees Celsius. Process engineers can tune the CFE eBeam system for maximum resolution or they can lower the resolution to match that of TFE but with significantly faster imaging speed. The pictures below illustrates the resolution and speed differences between CFE and TFE. Until now, use of CFE-based systems has been limited to lab environments because the stability of the eBeam column was insufficient for the stringent requirements of high-volume semiconductor manufacturing. One of the main factors affecting stability is the cleanliness of the eBeam column. All eBeam systems contain an extremely small source tip that emits the electrons used for imaging. Because the tip is so small, any contamination \u2013 even a single atom \u2013 can potentially disrupt the flow of electrons and cause system instability. In TFE systems, the source tip is so hot that it automatically repels any contaminants that might gather on the surface. In contrast, the room temperature operation of CFE, which is the main driver for its higher performance, makes cleaning much more challenging. To bring CFE technology out of the lab and into the fab, Two innovations that solved the CFE stability challenge. The first was creating an extreme ultra-high vacuum inside the eBeam column that is well below 1 x 10-11 millibar, which is two to three orders of magnitude better than for TFE systems and nearly the vacuum level found in outer space! Through an extensive optimization process, an extreme ultra-high vacuum was combined with specially developed chamber materials to greatly reduce the presence of contaminants inside the eBeam column. Even under extreme ultra-high vacuum, a tiny amount of residual gas can still exist. If gas molecules adhere to the electron source, performance is significantly degraded. The second innovation we developed is a cyclical self-cleaning process that continuously removes contaminants from the CFE source, thereby enabling stable and repeatable performance for high-volume manufacturing environments. Bringing CFE eBeam technology to high volume chip making manufacturing took more than 10 years of intense development of a CFE defect review and defect inspection platforms. By enabling chipmakers to discover defects they\u2019ve never been able to see before, faster, CFE is helping accelerate the development and production of advanced process nodes.", "As semiconductor devices continue to introduce new materials and structures, not only the dimensions but the material properties are becoming important in determining the device properties. Properties of insulator films used in transistors and memory devices, such as breakdown voltage and damage, are of particular interest as they determine the characteristics as well as the reliability of the devices. To ensure efficient production of these devices, an inline tool for metrology and inspection of material properties is desirable. One way to evaluate the material properties is to measure the material\u2019s response to application of voltage. For this purpose, we have developed laser-assisted SEM; an SEM with laser irradiation capability to control the electrical state of the material under SEM observation. The laser can be used to inject carriers into insulators and neutralize insulator charging caused by the electron beam. By evaluating the energy of secondary electrons, we measured the charging voltage of insulators, defined as the difference in the surface potential between when the laser is irradiated and not irradiated. Similarly to breakdown voltage, we verified that the charging voltage increases with the insulator thickness. Furthermore, charging voltage was shown to be dependent on damage due to plasma in an etcher. Therefore, charging voltage measurements assisted by a laser is a unique way to evaluate the material property of insulators. We believe our laser assisted SEM will open the door to new types of electrical and material characterizations and go beyond the traditional role of SEMs in metrology and inspection.", "The transistor architecture of complementary FET (CFET) is attractive for scaling down in technology nodes beyond 1 nm. CFET comprising vertically stacked nMOS and pMOS can be integrated monolithically and sequentially. The monolithic process is cost effective but complex because it requires patterning of high-aspect-ratio (HAR) structures and vertical edge placement control for stacked n-p nanosheet channels. It also brings challenges to in-line metrology in measuring the vertical dimension. In this work, we demonstrate a non-destructive, in-line metrology solution to measure the etch-back depth by CD-SEM. As the backscattered electron (BSE) signal intensity at the bottom of an HAR structure is determined by the structure's depth and top dimension, the depth can be monitored via an index based on the grey level and top dimension in CD-SEM images. Wafers with different etch-back depths were measured for evaluation of the M0 etch-back process in CFET integration. Good agreement was obtained between the etch-back depths measured by CDSEM and TEM. The flexible capability of CD-SEM to measure the depth and variation from extremely small areas to the wafer level could be helpful for CFET process control.", "High voltage scanning electron microscopy (HV-SEM) has recently been adopted as an on-device overlay metrology tool. However, the chip-manufacturing industry requests more advanced tools capable of low-distortion imaging and versatile measurement functionality for multi-layer processing. We developed a high voltage e-beam inspection (HV-EBI) tool for on-device overlay metrology that fills the abovementioned requirement. The HV-EBI tool has the capability of variable acceleration voltage in the range of 30kV to 50kV and wide field of view (FOV) imaging up to a maximum of 50\u03bcm with extremely low first-order distortion in the level of <0.01% and 0.1mrad and uniform in-plane beam perpendicularity.

By applying the methods we propose, we were able to successfully detect the hidden weak signals of the millimeter scale in the wafer.", "The W-Recess step for 3D NAND replacement gate process currently has no in-line process control solution. W replacement renders the structure opaque in the ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared (UV/VIS/NIR) region beyond just a few tier layers in the most advanced 3D NAND devices. Additionally, increased word line (WL) slit pitch scaling further reduces the already minimal optical signal from the top of the structure. Through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and optical critical dimension (OCD) simulations, we show that a specially designed, design rule-compliant (that is, possessing a slit pitch matching the device) ellipsometry target permits mid-IR light to completely penetrate through oxide metal (OM) pairs, enabling measurement of the W-Recess Z-profile. Furthermore, recent experimental data measured on the designed target in >200 pair 3D NAND node prove that mid-IR light has sensitivity to the slit bottom. An OCD model was developed and showed good design of experiment (DOE) discrimination capability and reference correlation.", "As DRAM technology continues to evolve, advanced nodes shrink the device dimensions and raise the requirements for on-product overlay control to reduce residual error.

In this era of ever-expanding need for high-performance computing and ever-pervasive artificial intelligence, traditional scaling economics headwinds combined with the need for versatility and fast product development mandate a system-level approach to generate the efficiencies the industry has been able to provide in the past through more traditional scaling approaches. This system-level approach renders imperative the use of chiplet-based architectures and the use of heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging to achieve the disaggregation with best-performing and most efficient IP components to sustain a viable economic model while achieving performance targets.

Multi beam mask writers offer a solution for high-end masks where curvilinear features are predominant. For mid-range masks and emerging optical applications especially variable shaped beam systems still offer advantages. The challenge for optical applications is to expose large-scale non-Manhattan layouts such as slanted gratings, circle arrays, or curved geometrical structures with high fidelity in an efficient way. For arbitrary curved structures, including 3D, a novel shot count optimized and edge roughness aware approximation (JES-approximation) approach by ePLACE data preparation software package (Vistec Electron Beam GmbH, Germany) is applied. In contrast to common fracturing, both throughput and pattern fidelity in optical applications are highly increased. The optical quality by means of high sensitive haze measurements of diffractive axicons is proven. For repetitive structures such as slanted gratings or circle arrays the cell projection (CP) option is the solution of choice, but CP is also effective for arbitrarily curved gratings.

The high-productivity Multicolumn Electron Beam Lithography (MEBL) system combines a modular architecture with unique miniature e-beam columns to achieve productivity that is taking e-beam lithography from lab to fab. MEBL exhibits 10 to 100x productivity in most applications compared to conventional e-beam lithography. Beyond its superior resolution, MEBL also offers several important advantages over conventional photolithography: (1) Depth of Focus \u2013 over 100x larger than state-of-the-art optical systems. (2) Full-wafer Writing Field \u2013 the ability to write unique, seamless patterns over an entire wafer, not limited by conventional optical reticle size (typically 26 mm x 33 mm).

In parallel, Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) and its requirements of curvilinear data structure has gained momentum in recent years, putting the pressure on mask makers, in particular the mask writer. To fulfill the curvilinear feature requirements of high pattern resolution and large data volume, the mask writer needs to develop innovative techniques and update its error compensation strategies.

Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) manufacturing equipment utilizes a patterning technology that involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate.

Grayscale photolithography is an innovative and alternative approach to create 3D patterns such as microlenses for example. Exposure of a low contrast resist at different doses results in different thicknesses in the resist film. The variation of the intrinsic dose is obtained by using a binary mask that has different chromium densities, thus modulating the exposure intensity on the resist surface1. Secondly, the NanoImprint Lithography (NIL) is a technology capable of reproducing a wide morphological range. NIL is increasingly requested for the reproduction of 3D patterns.

The presented work consists of an innovative combination of inkjet printing of available optical polymers onto a prepatterned substrate and UV-replication which enables the manufacturing processes for tailor-made polymeric hybrid and biconvex micro-optical components. For this, inkjet printing of the optical polymers InkOrmo or InkEpo is used as a dispensing technique for additive manufacturing. The ink is printed into designated cavities on a patterned substrate that shows either diffractive or refractive features. After UV-induced polymerization, the cured component is separated from the soft mold substrate. This results in a combination of either a diffractive and a refractive element or two convex refractive elements in one monolithic component. The refractive part on top is self-organized by the surface energy and the shape is adjusted with the amount of dispensed ink enabling to tune the refractive power of the lens. The diffractive structure or convex shape on the opposite side of the lens is obtained by replicating the shape of the prepatterned substrate. Such advanced micro-optic components allow in principle a higher degree of system integration and thus further system miniaturization by e.g. substituting a multi lens system with a single hybrid lens. This novel manufacturing concept is composed to cost-effectively implement design requirements, making tailor-made diffractive-refractive lenses easily accessible e.g. to the MEMS/MOEMS community.", "Current lithographic techniques are limited to a resolution of a few nm with poor relative precision. Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) based lithography[1], removes H from H-passivated Si 2x1 (100) by a mode distinct from usual imaging. This technique is generally called Hydrogen Depassivation Lithography (HDL) and since it scans a beam of electrons around on a surface exposing a resist, it is a form of E-beam Lithography. The HDL approach is not effective with standard resists and, at present, has only a limited number of pattern transfer methods. The two primary ones are patterning 2D delta doped Si devices for solid state quantum devices and selective Atomic Layer Deposition metal oxides that can be used as hard etch masks. However, electron stimulated desorption of atoms and molecules is a fairly generic process and its use can be anticipated on a wide variety of substrates. Sub-nm resolution (0.768 nm) has been demonstrated and used for numerous research purposes, such as dopant positioning for quantum devices[2]. While sub-nm resolution is easily obtainable with standard Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) STMs, the repeatability and accuracy of the patterning has limited its applications.

Superconducting qubit technology, in particular, has emerged as a leading candidate for realizing a scalable quantum computing platform ready for paving the way to commercial quantum advantage. However, current academic approaches in fabrication and testing of quantum devices are not scalable and have already started to limit the rapid development of the field. Novel solutions are required to tackle the combined challenge of increasing the qubit count on a quantum processor and the need to further reduce the qubit\u2019s error rates. This, in turn, will lead to a renewed acceleration in qubit manufacturing, test and diagnostics. Here we present aspects of how to move superconducting qubit manufacturing and testing from small-scale laboratory to large-scale fabrication facility environments. To enable this transfer, two key ingredients are demonstrated: (i) A foundry-compatible fabrication process of superconducting qubits that can benefit from the advanced process control in industry-scale CMOS fabrication facilities, and (ii) an acceleration of testing and cryogenic measurement throughput by using a milli-Kelvin cryo-CMOS signal multiplexer operating in near proximity to quantum devices and integrated qubit diagnostic and benchmarking tools with end-to-end data analytics. Although some of these elements have been explored independently, co-development is crucial to enable an efficient scalable development cycle for quantum computing technology.

These stochastic variations are becoming more severe as critical dimensions continue to scale down, and can thus be expected to be a major challenge for the future use of single exposure EUV lithography. Complementing EUV lithography with directed self-assembly (DSA) of block-copolymers provides an interesting opportunity to mitigate the variability related to EUV stochastics. In this work, the DSA rectification process at imec is described for both line/space (L/S) and hexagonal contact hole (HEXCH) patterns. The benefits that rectification can bring, as well as the challenges for further improvement are being addressed based on the current status of imec\u2019s rectification process.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) has been reported many times in the past decade as a technique for forming fine patterns1- 12. As processes for application to the semiconductor process, the grapho-epitaxy process forms a desired pattern in an isolated area using a physical guide, and the chemical-epitaxy process forms a single pitch over a wide range using a chemical guide are typical. There are many reports regarding the line pattern formation using a lamellar phase to meet the demand for miniaturization from the mass production of semiconductors, and this is partly because the lamellar phase is relatively stable. However, for fine line pattern formation, multiplication techniques such as SADP (self-aligned double patterning) and SAQP (self-aligned quadruple patterning) have matured, and in recent years, the number of cases where EUV (extreme ultra-violet) single exposure is used is increasing. For this reason, DSA is rarely used in mass production of semiconductors. On the other hand, when miniaturizing high-density hole patterns, methods such as multiple exposure and etching, and methods of forming holes by crossing line patterns formed by SADP are relatively expensive. In addition, it is difficult to maintain the uniformity of hole CD (critical dimension) and pitch. In addition, when EUV is applied, it is not easy to suppress defects and form a wide range of patterns due to stochasticity, which has become a problem in recent years. Therefore, the formation of high-density hole patterns using DSA is attracting attention. In DSA, the hole diameter can be controlled by the molecular weight of BCP (block co-polymer), and the pitch tends to be uniform spontaneously. Also, if the chemical-epitaxy process is used, the pattern can be formed over a wide range. However, hole patterns using a cylinder phase tend to have large fluctuations in hole diameter and placement due to the high degree of freedom in placement. It is also important to what extent the established process can be extended to further miniaturization. In this presentation, we report on the hole pattern formation method by the chemo-epitaxy method and efforts to improve the fidelity for application to the semiconductor process.", "For printing the most critical features in semiconductor devices, single exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is quickly advancing as a replacement for ArF immersion-based multipatterning approaches. However, the transition from 193 nm to 13.5 nm light is severely limiting the number of photons produced by a given source power, leading to photon shot noise in EUV patterns. In addition, inhomogeneous distribution of components inside conventional photoresists is adding to the printing variability, especially when critical dimensions continue to shrink. As a result, stochastic issues leading to rough, non-uniform, and potentially defective patterns have become a major challenge for EUV lithography. A promising solution for this top-down patterning approach is complementing it with bottom-up directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers. In combination with 193i lithography, DSA of lamellae forming block copolymers has previously shown favorable results for defining dense line-space patterns using LiNe flow.1 In this study, we investigate the complementarity of EUV + DSA for rectification of pitch 28 nm line-space patterns. Roughness and defectivity are critical factors that need to be controlled to make these patterns industrially relevant. We look at the impact of DSA material and processing parameters on line edge roughness and line width roughness in order to identify and mitigate the origins of pattern roughness. On the other hand, we also assess the different types of defect modes that are observed by means of optical defect inspection and ebeam review, and study the root causes for their formation. To wrap-up, the benefits of 1X DSA versus 3X DSA are presented by comparing EUV + DSA to LiNe flow.", "The utility of block copolymers in nanofabrication and nanolithography can be enhanced by expanding the range of possible microdomain geometries available, and by developing methods to direct their self-assembly in the out-of-plane direction to make three dimensional structures. We will describe morphologies created by Si-containing triblock terpolymers, rod-coil copolymers, and bottlebrush copolymers, including zigzags, bends, junctions, tiling patterns and hierarchical structures with two independently tunable periods. Sequential self-assembly can produce three dimensional structures by assembling one block copolymer on another, including orthogonal mesh patterns. We also describe metal infiltration of block copolymers by immersion in an acid solution of a metal salt, and reversibility of the metallization by immersion in acid. Combinations of novel polymers, templating approaches, and processing techniques yield an extensive array of rectilinear and 3D pattern geometries that can ex", "Block copolymer (BCP) nanopatterning has emerged as a versatile nanoscale fabrication tool for semiconductor devices and other applications to organize periodic nanostructures with a critical dimension of 5\u2212100 nm. The intrinsically low cost and straightforward processing of BCP nanopatterning have been widely recognized for their large-area parallel formation of dense nanoscale features, which clearly contrasts that of sophisticated processing steps of the typical photolithographic process, including EUV lithography. In this presentation, we highlight our recent progress in the field of BCP nanopatterning for semiconductor as well as nonsemiconductor applications, such as nanocatalysts, metamaterials, sensors, PUF, energy devices and membranes.", "We have developed strongly-segregating chemically tailored block copolymers (BCPs), a series of post-functionalized polystyrene-b-polymethacrylates that can form sub-10 nm perpendicular lamellae on thin films by thermal annealing. The desired BCPs successfully synthesized by thiol-epoxy reaction of poly(glycidyl methacrylate)s, a partial component of polystyrene-b-polymethacrylates, with trifluoroethane thiol. Microdomains in the obtained BCP thin films were vertically oriented by tuning the Neutral Layer, and highly aligned and distinct vertical lamellae with L0=15.1 nm were successfully obtained on the guide pattern substrate for DSA.", "Bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer compelling advantages for self-assembly including rapid ordering dynamics and access to domain sizes in excess of 200 nm. Cooperative assembly of BBCPs with additives including nanoparticles, carbon precursors and metal oxide precursors can be readily accomplished at high additive loadings by introducing strong specific interactions between at least one segment of the BBCP and the additive. The resulting well-ordered composite materials can subsequently be patterned at the device level using nanoimprint lithography and finally converted to the desired hierarchical device structure by heating, rapid thermal annealing or pulsed flashlamp processing. Applications in high energy and power density supercapacitors, battery anodes, optical films, and metamaterials will be discussed.", "Polymer blending is a powerful approach to expand the nanopatterning landscape for block copolymer (BCP) directed self-assembly, itself a promising route to enhance resolution in established lithography techniques. However, investigating the vast and complex parameter spaces associated with blend self-assembly remains a daunting challenge. This talk will highlight examples where blending BCPs with homopolymers can dramatically speed up self-assembly kinetics for potential applications from nanophotonics to membrane synthesis, while blending two BCPs enables registered, template-responsive pattern selection. I will further describe ongoing efforts to accelerate investigations of blend formulation and processing using new combinatorial and autonomous methods.", "The newly formed Center for High Precision Patterning Science (CHiPPS) pursues a holistic approach to patterning science by studying the fundamentals of relevant interactions of light and matter and proposing co-designed materials and processes for precision patterning such as sequence defined and/or structured hybrid photoresists, molecular-level control of solvation steps, self-assembling materials for low-impact stochastics and molecularly precise and selective pattern transfer. The center leverages a world class EUV patterning research facility together with unique X-ray characterization built at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). In this presentation we will introduce the center\u2019s overall efforts in high precision patterning science and, in particular, we will put emphasis on an approach that employs novel self-assembling, hierarchical materials to heal the adverse stochastic effects on EUV photoresists and to enable pattern transfer methods with atomic or molecular precision.", "Roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography offers a method to scale functional micro and nanopatterned surfaces for a wide array of applications. However, creating a sufficiently large, seamless drum mold is still often prohibitively expensive or impossible. This patterning becomes especially difficult when the periodicity of the pattern is smaller than half the wavelength of visible light, the limit for UV interference lithography. High-speed indentation via a novel process called \u201cNanocoining\u201d has been demonstrated to overcome this issue. Thus far, Nanocoining has been used to create cylindrical molds up to 6.5 inches in diameter and 6 inches in length with a patterning rate of more than one square inch per minute. The process has been demonstrated with features between 250 nm and 5 \u03bcm in pitch (center-to-center distance) and aspect ratios (height:pitch) of up to 0.6, and the resulting molds have successfully embossed into more than 500 linear feet of film. In this proceeding, we will present the background and state of the art of this technology as well as recent efforts to control feature shape for applications like microlens arrays. We\u2019ll also introduce new concepts, including using indentation to create seamless, cylindrical photomasks for roll-to-roll patterning of resists without the residual layer that is typically left behind by nanoimprint lithography.", "Hybrid Polymers are a material class established in the industry for manufacturing of high-performance optical components, mainly patterned by (nano)imprint processes. Recently, the application range of Hybrid Polymers has been extended into bonding and passivation. In this context, patterning by classical UV-lithography has come into focus as an alternative patterning method to (nano)imprinting. By applying a two-stage curing process with a high intensity, low dose patterning step and a high dose flood exposure after development, it is possible to realize previously unattainable resolutions limits for Hybrid Polymers of 6\u03bcm L/S and aspect ratios of more than 3.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "In this work, we aim to demonstrate the progress of dry resist development to address specific challenges of high NA EUV lithography. As features scales, resist thickness and interface between resist and underlayer play a crucial role. The co-optimization of underlayers with dry technology enables tuning of the patterning stack for optimal performance. Dry deposition of resists offers precise control over thickness and composition to improve material variability. Dry development reduces the likelihood of pattern collapse and enhances the ability to print features at higher aspect ratio. Defect characterization at pitch 28nm test vehicles at imec have been used to validate the material and process improvements in the dry resist program. Furthermore, dry resist patterning performance at pitch 24nm dense line-space and pitch 34nm hexagonal dense pillars and contact holes will be discussed showing the readiness towards the high NA EUV patterning.", "The unique suitability of metal-oxide (MOx) photoresists for high-NA EUV lithography has been demonstrated by successful imaging of these resists at the resolution limit of high-NA exposure tools. We utilize the capabilities of the 0.5-NA Berkeley MET5 and a 0.33-NA scanner to explore the RLS impact of specific formulation adjustments, alternative develop chemistries and bake processes, and etch optimization of features from 16-26nm pitch. We investigate the effect of these optimizations on defectivity at aggressive pitches using 0.33-NA exposures. These results validate both fundamental advantages and continued progress of MOx development to align with the introduction of high-NA imaging.", "EUV resist materials are crucial for enabling next-generation lithographic technologies that aim to achieve high-volume manufacturing (HVM) at sub-5 nm nodes. In this study, we report an extensive performance characterization of EUV photoresists for future high-NA EUV lithography. We investigated the performance of various resists using the EUV interference lithography tool at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) within the framework of a collaboration between the Paul Scherrer Institute and ASML. This paper presents the major outcomes of the work conducted in the second half of 2022. Important performance characteristics taken into account in this study are resolution or half-pitch (HP), dose-to-size (DtS) and line-width roughness (LWR). To evaluate the overall performance of the resists, we used the Z-factor. We investigated both chemically amplified resists (CAR) and non-CAR materials. CARs from two vendors achieved a resolution down to 11 nm half-pitch, while multi-trigger resists (MTR) reached a resolution of 13 nm. In comparison, MTRs demonstrated better Z-factor values owing to their high sensitivity. In addition, we investigated the effect of underlayers on the performance of metal organic resists (MOR). We, finally, discuss the overall progress in resist performance over recent years. We observed a steady improvement across several resist platforms, which is encouraging for global EUV resist development towards high-NA EUVL.", "One of the key steps in the pattern formation chain of (extreme ultraviolet) EUV lithography is the development process to resolve the resist pattern after EUV exposure. A simple traditional development process might not be sufficient to achieve the requirements of an ultra-high-resolution feature with low defect levels in high numerical aperture (NA) EUV lithography. In our previous literature, a new development method named ESPERTTM (Enhanced Sensitivity develoPER TechnologyTM) has been introduced to improve the performance of metal oxide resists (MOR) for 0.33 NA EUV lithography by breaking the dose-roughness trade-off. In this work, this development technique was optimised for high-NA lithography to not only keep the advantages of previous ESPERTTM version, but also reduce the defect levels at a higher EUV sensitivity. This is made possible thanks to the capability of the new version of ESPERTTM that can easily remove the residue (undeveloped resist) at low exposure dose area to enhance the developing contrast. Using 0.33 NA EUV scanners at imec on 16-nm half-pitch (HP) line/space (L/S) patterns, with the new development method, EUV dose-to-size (DtS) was reduced roughly 16%, and total after-development-inspection (ADI) defects was reduced by a factor of approximately 7, simultaneously. In another condition, DtS was reduced from 44.2 to 28.4 mJ/cm\u00b2 (an improvement of 36%), while the number of after-etch-inspection (AEI) single-bridge defects was reduced by half, simultaneously. Using the 0.5 NA exposure tool at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with this new development method, the exposure sensitivity and line-width-roughness (LWR) were both improved by 30% and 21%, respectively. An 8-nm-HP L/S pattern was also successfully printed by this high NA tool. Using a 150 kV electron-beam (EB) lithography system, a 12-nm-HP of pillars was successfully printed on a 22-nm-thick MOR resist with ESPERTTM. With all the advantages of having a high exposure sensitivity, a low defectivity, and an ultra-high-resolution capability, this new development method is expected to be a solution for high-NA EUV lithography.", "In this work, we introduce main chain scission resists with new concept for High-NA\u2019s generation and report their lithography performance. Zeon has developed a new resist (ZER02#06M) in order to improve both resolution and lithography performance because conventional Zeon resists generated worse resolution and kissing(C/H), pinching(L/S) defects at tight pitch by top loss. The concreate approaches in order to improve the challenges are that to make scission reaction efficient and to get developability at exposed area higher in changing both monomers and functional groups. Zeon aims to make clear threshold between exposed and un-exposed area and improve low contrast and sensitivity at tight patterns especially. The lithography performance of ZER02#06M with their approaches were able to improve LCDU and margin with low LCDU on litho-performance compared to ZER02#04DM and ZER02#05M. Additionally, Zeon resists are indicated to have long-terms stability during litho-process with delay.", "In semiconductor manufacturing, thousands of process steps are required to produce an integrated circuit (IC) chip; each with a uniformity signature that impacts yield. Typically, non-uniformities can be minimized by tuning process conditions. However, even after extensive process optimization, there\u2019s often a residual signature that needs to be removed. The Z-Height chemistry and hardware set applies a spatial correction aimed at removing these residuals and improving planarity. The pitch doubled self-aligned block (SAB) approach of patterning sub-resolution metal lines is one such integration that benefits from this correction method by improving the block height uniformity to ensure proper pattern transfer and a wider process window. In this paper, we will discuss the approach to correct for the thickness non-uniformities induced by the spin-coating and etch processes of a spin-on glass film. Initial results show a 36% improvement in film thickness variation.", "Control of wafer backside defectivity is a challenge during the chip manufacturing process and has been extensively investigated throughout the past decade, especially on immersion lithography systems. As technology nodes continue to scale down and we approach the high NA EUV lithography era, backside contamination is becoming a critical problem. High NA EUV exposure systems have a smaller depth of focus compared to low NA EUV systems. The presence of backside wafer defects can easily lead to focus loss or on-product overlay errors leading to pattern failures. To anticipate the upcoming challenges, SCREEN has developed a sophisticated track-integrated backside cleaning (BSC) module on the DT-3000 system. This enables an advanced post-coating BSC solution directly before exposure. Together ASML, imec and SCREEN, investigated the potential of this unique BSC process to extend the lithographic performance of EUV material stacks, by correlating backside contamination with frontside patterning performance and the minimization of scanner focus spots. With this approach, we try to identify and characterize potential backside defect killers that could cause not only yield loss, but also physical deterioration of the scanner wafer table (WT) and its lifetime.", "Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography poses an ever greater challenge to RLS (resolution, line edge roughness, and sensitivity) than previous photolithography methods, as lithographers try to achieve sub-14 nm pitch in a single-exposure [1-2]. Additionally, EUV is particularly susceptible to stochastic imaging defects[3]. Although standard chemically amplified resists (CAR) can be exposed with EUV, these materials struggle to achieve resolution targets at manufacturable doses due to limitations in laser source power and resist sensitivity and contribute to stochastics by nature of their random distribution of components. An innovative approach with metal-oxide resist can offer an alternative to overcome both EUV resolution and sensitivity limitations, as well as address stochastic defects[4-5]. On the other hand, traditional sources of defectivity, such as particles, presents another challenge, especially when moving toward high volume manufacturing. Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UPE) filters have been used for metal oxide EUV resist filtration because of their high retention efficiency and excellent photochemical compatibility. However, other filters with innovative materials are needed to further lower defectivity of these new resists. This paper describes efforts to continuously improve metal oxide EUV resist defectivity through filtration optimization. A comparative study of the patterning performance of various Point-of-Use (POU) filters is presented. Several filters utilizing a variety of retention ratings and membrane designs were installed on a TEL Clean TrackTM LITHIUS ProTM Z EUV series. A metal oxide EUV resist was filtered and coated on wafers that were subsequently analyzed for after etch inspection (AEI) patterning defect performance. This study examines the efficacy of optimized filtration design to reduce defects and provides a recommendation to achieve lower defect density.", "The control of wet particles (WPs) is more stringent as the resolution of photolithography increases, especially in advanced photolithography such as extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). Owing to continuing advancements in technology and resolution, it is expected that WPs smaller than the EUVL photoresist (PR) pattern sizes will need to be eliminated from silicon wafer surfaces in the near future. WPs are mainly comprised of micro/nano bubbles or organic/inorganic contaminants. The contaminants are eluted from equipment components, such as liquid filters and tubing, prior to the coating process. Flushing with conventional solvents used in photolithography eliminates WPs, however it consumes a great deal of time and solvent. TRICTM-007, a novel cleaner, was developed to remove contaminants effectively and efficiently. A PR coating equipment with a point-of-use filter installed was used for testing. Flushing with TRICTM-007 followed by a conventional solvent allowed for shorter flushing times relative to flushing with solvent alone. In addition, the amount of solvent needed to flush the equipment after using TRICTM-007 was significantly less than that of using only solvent. Furthermore, the photolithographic performance of the PR was tested by running wafer repeatability test. Tests using a filter flushed with the cleaner followed by solvent were compared to tests using a filter flushed with solvent alone. All results were similar and within specifications, proving that TRICTM- 007 did not affect the quality of the PR.", "The manufacturing process of advanced logic devices has become ever more challenging than before due to continued shrinkage in dimensions from scaling down and increased complexity from the integration of new transistor structures such as gate-all-around (GAA). Underlayers are utilized as a mask to protect targeted device structures while selected areas of deposited metal is removed by wet etchant during replacement metal gate (RMG) process to construct the transistor. Reported studies describing the developmental strategies for such underlayers have been mostly focused on how to strengthen the adhesion towards the substrate with the designed film properties. In this paper, we identify the effect of plasma during dry etching of the RMG process as the factor to be considered in designing of the wet etch resistant underlayer. Physical and chemical properties of organic films after dry etching with plasmas of different gases have been investigated using various analysis techniques, and the subsequent effect of plasma-modification on the film properties such as resistance towards wet chemicals for various films was evaluated.", "In 2019, finally, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has been applied to high volume manufacturing (HVM). However, the performance of EUV resist materials are still not enough for the expected HVM requirements, even by using the latest qualifying EUV resist materials. The critical issues are the stochastic issues, which will become \u2018defectivity\u2019. The analyzing summary of the stochastic factors in EUV lithography was reported, which described 2 (two) major stochastic issues, which are \u2018Photon stochastic\u2019 and \u2018Chemical stochastic\u2019. In the past, speaking of the stochastic issue was basically considered from low photon number from EUV light source, which means \u2018photon shot noise\u2019. It was still critical concerning point, even with recent progress on source power improvement. However, the stochastic issue is not only from them but also from EUV materials and processes, called \u2018Chemical stochastic\u2019. The \u2018Chemical stochastic\u2019 means caused from resist materials and processes for lithography, materials uniformity in the film, reactive uniformity in the film, and dissolving behavior with the developer. In this paper, we will focus on \u2018Chemical stochastic\u2019 improvement, especially, the dissolving behavior by using negative-tone imaging (NTI, using organic solvent-based developer) with EUV exposure (EUV-NTI). EUV-NTI had a potential for improving \u2018Chemical stochastic\u2019 because of their properties, which were low swelling and smooth dissolving behavior. However, the pattern collapse was easily observed for preparing fine patterns with the standard developer. Newly proposed novel formulated organic solvent-based developer will be expected to improve the patter collapse issue and \u2018Chemical stochastic\u2019. Lithographic performance will also be reported.", "Modelling the pattern formation process in photoresist materials for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography in a stochastic and mechanistic manner, with molecular-scale resolution, should enable predicting the effect of variations of material parameters and process conditions, leading to insights into the ultimate resolution limits. In this work, we present the results of the first steps toward that goal. We describe the physics of the development with time of cascades of electrons and holes, created by the stochastic absorption of 92 eV photons, using a kinetic Monte Carlo model with molecular resolution. The thin film material is modelled assuming a cubic array of lattice sites, at a distance that is consistent with the molecular density of the photoresist material that is considered. The simulation of the cascading process is based on the experimental optical energy loss function, extended to include also excitations with momentum transfer. The method allows for including the Coulomb interactions between charges. In contrast to earlier work, within which the high-energy electrons move ballistically until scattering takes place, the trajectories are in our model formed by stochastically determined interconnected molecular sites. In future extensions of the model, this approach will facilitate including in a natural way a transition from delocalized electron transport at high energies to hopping transport of localized electrons at low energies. The simulations are used to study the sensitivity of the average number of degradations per absorbed photon and the average electron blur length on the rates of elastic scattering and of molecular degradation, and on the energy that is lost upon a molecular degradation process.", "One of the major challenges to lithography today is minimizing the consequences of stochastics, that is, the effect of statistical differences in photoresist structure and the distribution of additives, such as photo active compounds, in the photoresist. Most polymer photoresists due to their method of production will have large differences between polymer chains in molecular weight, composition, and sequence due to the nature of polymer synthesis. However, there exist methods of polymer formation that make uniform composition polymers such a homopolymers made using living polymerization. We discuss scissionable poly(phthalaldehyde)s as one example of a low stochastics photoresist. Using another method originally developed for the biological community we make polymers in which molecular weight, composition and sequence are identical in all polymer chains produced. Here we thus describe studies of polypeptoids, synthetic analogs of peptides, which have no chirality and in which the substituents are placed on the backbone nitrogen. The peptoids are produced as chemically amplified photoresists and are intended for study as EUV materials. To produce a CAR with aqueous base development using this hydrophilic backbone we have successfully learned how to make a more hydrophobic patterning system with Tg >100 \u00b0C. With our ability to control of sequence we have started to explore the effect that monomer placement has on lithographic performance and found that indeed sequence does play an important role. Sequences of solubility switch groups, adhesive, etch resistant and hydrophobic groups have been studied. Using e-beam lithography we have recently demonstrated sub-30 nm resolution.", "The ability for the EUV photoresist to reproducibly and reliably print desired features is critical to the success of EUV lithography. However, at the desired feature sizes, fundamental resist inhomogeneities leading to local variations in resist sensitivity are a critical issue. Non-random molecular distributions within chemically amplified EUV photoresists can be caused by a combination of thermodynamics and kinetics. As the solvent evaporates during the spin coating process there is the opportunity at higher solids concentrations for the multi-component chemically amplified EUV resist to enter a state where it is energetically favorable to segregate. Then, any remaining molecular motion before the resist effectively dries to a solid will lead to potential for segregation of those molecules in the resist. We will show recent work to control the segregation by varying the resist coating and processing conditions.", "Semiconducting device manufacture encounters more lithographic challenges in terms of feature size shrinking, killer contaminants, and balancing performance requirements for advanced node patterning. This talk will provide an overview of the key barriers and scopes for materials innovations to enable high resolution patterning, fast photospeed, low roughness and defects, while maintaining a good processing window. It will also provide a fundamental view of how nanometric uniformity and the interplay between different components in a photoresist thin film impact pattern fidelity.", "For the advancement of lithography, the resist materials and processes are the most critical issue in the microfabrication of semiconductors. Especially in the sub-20 nm half pitch resolution region, the development process of resist materials is of particular importance from the viewpoint of reducing the line width roughness (LWR) and stochastic defects. In this study, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method was used to investigate the dissolution dynamics of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS) films containing triphenylphosnium-nonaflate (TPS-nf) in tetraalkylammonium hydroxide aqueous solutions. The comparison of dissolution dynamics in five different developer solutions with different alkyl chain lengths was done.", "The blur caused by the nonzero mean free path of electrons in photoresist during extreme ultraviolet lithography has detrimental consequence on patterning resolution, but its effect is difficult to measure experimentally. In this work, a modified substrate-overlayer technique was used to evaluate the attenuation of the photoemission spectra produced in thin chemically amplified photoresist films. The inelastic mean free path of electrons was found to be between 1 to 2 nm in the entire range of interest for EUV lithography (20 to 100 eV kinetic energy). At higher kinetic energy, the mean free path increased consistently with well-known behavior. The presence of photoacid generator and quencher did not change the mean free path significantly (within experimental error).", "The emergence of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources utilizing 13.5 nm for high volume manufacturing played a role in upgrading semiconductor technology once again. The demand for photoresists to satisfy smaller and more advanced nodes is becoming increasingly important and challenging. The aim of this work is to investigate the chromatographic techniques to separate random copolymer for photoresist materials according to chemical composition. A systematic study is reported for a fundamental understanding of how the molecular weight distribution and chemical composition of polymers included in photoresist affect lithography performance. Compared to other conventional methods such as GPC, the new approach in this study is accurate and high resolution, and can be utilized to identify and quantify the organic polymer in photoresist", "Fundamental understanding of the physical processes controlling deprotection in chemical amplified resists (CARs) is critical to improve their utility for high-resolution lithography. We employ a combined experimental and computational method to examine the impacts of excess free volume generation, reaction byproducts, catalyst clustering, and catalyst counter-anion chemistry/size on deprotection rates in a model terpolymer CAR. These studies suggest that catalyst diffusion can be enhanced by a combination of excess free volume and reaction byproducts, and that counter-anion chemistry/size plays a key role in local reaction rates, which stems from differences in the rotational mobility of the catalyst.", "In EUV lithography, good resist patterning requires an assist layer beneath it to provide adhesion to prevent pattern collapse of small features and allow for higher aspect ratios. In addition, future EUV high numerical aperture (NA) is expected to require a decrease in thickness from the overall patterning stack. In this study, we are exploring a fundamentally new approach to developing an alternative and cost-effective underlayer to functionalize surfaces and enable EUV patterning. Rather than forming a 5-nm polymer film between the resist and its substrate, we propose to modify the substrate by spin-coating a thinner layer. In contrast to conventional underlayers (5\u201310 nm), the substrate is modified by a sub-1-nm layer during baking. Comprehensive analysis of the surface modification and coating was conducted by GPC, ellipsometer, and contact angle to identify the structure, stability, coating quality, and surface energy. Lithographic performance of existing EUV resist with the assist of this thin layer on Si wafers and different silicon hardmasks was evaluated using NXE3400 EUV exposure system to print HP14nm line-space features. It has been demonstrated that this sub-1-nm layer is able to realize HP14nm with a wider process window, higher depth of focus, and lower LWR on a Si wafer. Moreover, a silicon hardmask that could not realize printable features had significantly improved lithographic performance with the assist of this layer. Comparisons were also made with the industry-standard HMDS priming. Systematic analysis indicates that a sub-1-nm layer exemplifies a novel and effective way to enhance photoresist-substrate compatibility and improve EUV lithographic performance.", "For EUV high NA lithography, current conventional tri-layer procss has the critical issue both for EUV litho performance & pattern etch transfer. Especially since the latest EUV PR including CAR and MOR is very low film thickness around 10nm, Si containing hard mask (Si-HM) should be around 5nm. In this case, it is too difficult to transfer to SOC and the bottom hard mask layer. In order to prevent this critical issue, we proose new functional surface treatment process and primers (FSTP) on the conventional CVD hard mask or Si-HM. This FSTP is spin coating materials. However it is almost sigle molecular type ultra thin primer (~1nm) for all of the CVD & spin on hard mask (SiON, SiN, TiN, SiO2, SiHM, SOG and so on) not to bother fine pitch pattern transfer. Moreover, this FSTP has high universalithy to EUV PR CAR and MOR to achieve high patterning performance in EUVL. Therefore FSTP has big advantage in EUV litho process and pattern etch transfer for next generation High NA EUV process.", "Wafer backside particles is one of the issues in the IC manufacturing process that has been extensively investigated through the past decades, especially on immersion systems. However, as the technology nodes continue to scale down and we are approaching the high NA EUV lithography era, backside contamination control remains to be very important. To anticipate these upcoming challenges, SCREEN has developed a sophisticated track-integrated backside cleaning (BSC) module on the DT-3000 system, which offers an advanced post-coating BSC solution before exposure. Together with imec and ASML, we investigate the potential of this unique BSC process to guarantee the lithographic performance of EUV material stacks. This is done by correlating the backside contamination with frontside patterning performance before and after minimizing the number of scanner-focus spots. With this approach, we try to identify, characterize, and eliminate potential backside defects that could cause not only yield loss, but also physically deteriorate the scanner wafer table (WT) and hence its lifetime.", "The semiconductor industry is on the rise of maturing EUV lithography in high volume manufacturing (HVM). There remain, however, challenges to be overcome in the advancement of photoresist to improve yield and reduce cost of ownership. Herein, we report a novel chemical trimming overcoat process as a post-lithography spin-on solution to enhance EUV photoresist performance, enabling effective photospeed reduction as well as process window enhancement, such as reducing bridging defect at underdose. This is a highly versatile and tunable process for most chemically amplified photoresists, therefore allowing it to become a general process for a wide range of applications across EUV lithography.", "To further enable device scaling in HVM, new patterning materials are needed to meet the more stringent requirements such as line width and edge roughness (LWR and LER), dose sensitivity, pattern collapse, etch resistance and defectivity. The continuous progression of the shrinking of resist feature sizes will be accompanied by the scaling-down of the resist film thickness to prevent pattern collapse and to compensate for low depth-of-focus for high-NA EUV lithography. However, if we reduce the resist film thickness, we must also reduce the underlayer (UL) hardmask film thickness for optimum pattern transfer. As an alternative to spin-on underlayers, deposited ULs can be a potential candidate as it is possible to produce very thin uniformly deposited ULs, with the freedom to incorporate different elements to improve adhesion and modify etch selectivity. In this paper, we will discuss deposited ULs with film thickness scaled down to 3.5 nm for EUV lithography patterning as well as etch performance for pitch 32 and 28 line/space structures. We will also discuss about the possibility to modify the ULs to match the surface energy of the photoresist in use in order to minimize pattern collapse. Additionally, with scaled-down deposited ULs, we were able to obtain very similar post-litho unbiased roughness values (LWR 2.23 nm and LER 1.7 nm) as 10 nm spin-on reference UL (LWR: 2.26 nm and LER 1.66 nm). We will discuss more such details in terms of surface roughness, dose sensitivity, post-litho and post-etch LWR, LER, pattern collapse and defectivity in the presentation. Such ULs could become useful for high-NA EUV lithography when the litho stack is expected to scale down in thickness.", "The dissociative photoionization of tert-butyl methyl methacrylate, a monomer unit found in many ESCAP resists, was investigated in a gas phase photoelectron photoion coincidence experiment employing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) synchrotron radiation at 13.5 nm. It was found that the interaction of EUV photons with the molecules leads almost exclusively to dissociation. However, the ionization can also directly deprotect the ester function, thus inducing the solubility switch wanted in a resist film. These results serve as a building block to reconstruct the full picture of the mechanism in widely used chemically amplified resist thin films, provide a knob to tailor more performant resist materials, and will aid interpreting advanced ultrafast time-resolved experiments.", "Theoretical lithography performance prediction of photoresist material has important role to design better material but the exact prediction was still difficult because there are too many conditions to be considered together. We investigated the EUV-induced photochemical reactions of conventional triphenylsulfonium (Ph3S+; TPS) PAG-cation in both \u201celectron-trapping\u201d and \u201cinternal excitation\u201d mechanisms using atomic-scale materials modeling. By obtaining full energy profiles of protonation process of TPS molecule, we could find that the acid generation yield strongly depends on two main factors: the LUMO of PAG-cation in which the lower LUMO of PAG-cation, the reduction step of PAG-cation is easier and the proton (H+) dissociation ability (pKa) at the ortho-positions of thiol ether fragment cation(Ph2S+), in which lower pKa will give high acid generation. By matching computational analysis with experimental results, we developed a two-parameter model to predict the EUV exposure Dose from the target PAG\u2013cation\u2019s LUMO and pKa of thiol ether-derivatives. We applied our new model to other three sets of TPS samples and they also shows good correlation with experimental data. Finally, we proposed a strategy to design new PAG molecules for sensitivity improvement by functionalization of TSP-cation with electron donating group. Our new strategy can be a powerful tool to design novel PAG cation for EUV photoresist for improving Resolution-LER-Sensitivity trade-off.", "Sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) is becoming an important tool for resist hardening and formation of unique nanostructures. SIS is a variant of atomic layer deposition (ALD), in which the organometallic precursors are allowed to diffuse into the polymeric substrate before condensation. In contrast to ALD, the extended diffusion time in SIS potentially allows for extensive penetration into the substrate. An important parameter in SIS is the affinity of the precursor with the polymer substrate. Differences in affinity can be exploited, for e.g., for generation of patterned structures within block copolymers. To date, the interactions between the precursor molecules, for example trimethyl aluminium (TMA) have been inferred from in situ or ex situ vibrational spectroscopy. Potentially much richer information can be gained from NMR and transmission FTIR spectroscopy of solutions of precursor and polymer. Fundamental studies of PMMA and TMA allow identification and screening of novel polymer substrates for SIS. Previous studies have provided broad design rules for SIS; e.g., highly-polar and strongly basic structures enhance uptake of precursors. The precursor molecules such as TMA are Lewis acids and hence will associate with functional groups having base character. We have investigated SIS polymers that incorporate a stronger Lewis base group, sulfinyl, in poly((2-methylsulfinyl) ethyl methacrylate) (PMSEMA). Details of the interactions between TMA and PMSEMA in solution, and as films, and comparison with a range of other materials, provide information on potential of these materials for SIS.", "We describe an exploration of small molecules capable of suppressing the solubility of polymers with pendent carboxylic acid groups. We evaluate the use of small molecules such as alkyl amines, benzyl bromide, N,N\u2019-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N,N-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC). We have combined polymers containing carboxylic acids with these reagents and evaluated their changes in dissolution rate in n-butyl acetate and 0.26 N TMAH. We have also conducted model reactions of non-polymeric carboxylic acids in NMR tubes to help characterize the reactions occurring with polymers.", "Science stands on three legs: hypothesis, experiment, and simulation. This holds true for researching extreme ultraviolet (EUV) exposure of photoresist. Hypothesis: For resist exposure as patterns get smaller and closer together, approaching molecular units in width and resist-height, the molecular dynamics will limit the working resolution of the resist due to the formation of printing defects. Without taking proper consideration of these dynamics, the single-patterning lithography roadmap may end prematurely. Experimentally we are developing methods for sub-picosecond tracking of photoionization-induced processes. Using ultrashort pulses of light to excite and probe new materials with techniques that show the interactive dynamics of electronic and nuclear motion at the very limits of light-speed. This certainly holds true for exposing photoresists with EUV where ultrafast photoreactions induce chemical change via multiple pathways such as high-energy ionization fragmentation, recombination, and multispecies combination that ideally end in low-energy electron transfer reactions, analogous to lower energy photoreaction (but with a charge). In the nonideal case, these reaction processes lead to incompatible byproducts of the radiolysis that lead to types of stochastic defects. To do ultrafast studies we must build a foundation of knowledge using atomistic simulation to interpret transient molecular dynamic processes. Before we can do this, we need to learn how to simulate various spectral modalities to provide a starting point. In this work, we examine X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy of a model resist and use atomistic simulation to interpret the reactant-product composition of the spectral samples.", "In this paper, we report on a novel metal organic photoresist based on heterometallic rings that was designed for electron beam and extreme ultraviolet lithography. From initial electron beam lithography studies, the resist performance demonstrated excellent resolution of 15 nm half-pitch (HP) and a silicon dry etch selectivity of 100:1 but at the expense of sensitivity. To improve sensitivity, a 3D Monte Carlo simulation was employed that utilizes a secondary electron generation model. The simulation suggested that the sensitivity could be dramatically improved while maintaining high resolution by incorporating HgCl2 species into the resist molecular design. This considerably improved the resist sensitivity without losing the high resolution, where it was determined that the resist sensitivity was increased by a factor of 1.6 and 1.94 while demonstrating a resolution of 15 nm and 16 nm HP when exposed with electrons and EUV radiation respectively. Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, we show that after exposure to the electron beam the resist materials are transformed into a metal oxyfluoride and this is why the resist demonstrates high resistance to silicon dry etch conditions achieving a selectivity of 60:1 at a resolution of 15 nm HP.", "Metal oxide (MOx) photoresists have matured into a leading platform for advanced-node EUV Lithography, particularly for tight pitches and High-NA applications. To meet the requirements for High-NA, there must be simultaneous improvements in resist design, processing, and metrology. Here, we evaluate new resist and process modifications through detailed roughness analysis. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of resist formulation improvements and different development processes that take advantage of the MOx platform, and the performance of MOx resists at different film thicknesses. Additionally, we investigate the impact of etch and discuss strategies for metrology improvement as the industry prepares for High-NA.", "In this work we assess the effect of the change of counter-anions on the photolithography properties of butyl-Sn12 oxo hydroxo cages. The hydroxide anions were exchanged with tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (B(PFP)4)- and (phenyl) trifluoroborate (BF3Ph)- anions which exhibit a photoabsorption cross section at 92 eV that is similar to that of the butyl-Sn12 oxo hydroxo cages. The degradation of the EUV photoresist was monitored via in-situ EUV exposure followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at the BEAR beamline (Elettra, Italy) at the C1s-edge. Both systems exhibit similar carbon losses of around 25% for 100 mJ/cm2 dose. The Sn12 cluster with acetate anions, as a reference compound, exhibit a loss of C1s XPS signal from the butyl chains of around 23% for the same 100 mJ/cm2 EUV exposure dose indicating a larger degradation of the Sn12 cluster for the latter. We also evaluated the patterning performance of the Sn12(B(PFP)4) resist via interference lithography at the XIL-II beamline (PSI, Switzerland) and found the positive tone character of the resist and its ability to write lines with 50 nm half pitch resolution for doses of 30 mJ/cm2. In contrast, Sn12(BF3Ph) acts as a sensitive negative tone resist, with doses of 12.5 mJ/cm2 sufficient to write 50 nm half pitch lines.", "High-NA EUV lithography required for continued extreme downscaling of Si devices demands ultrathin photoresists with high EUV patterning performance and etch resistance. This talk briefs our current efforts on synthesizing new organic-inorganic hybrid resists based on atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques and characterizing their electron beam and EUV patterning characteristics. Two distinctive approaches are discussed\u2013vapor-phase infiltration (VPI) and molecular ALD (MALD), where the former utilizes an infiltration of gaseous inorganic precursors into existing organic resists and the latter a cyclic layering of organic and inorganic moieties. Featured systems include an indium-oxide-infiltrated PMMA and a MALD hybrid resist comprising trimethylaluminum (TMA) and hydroquinone (HQ). Given the facile implementablility and control of resist composition and characteristics, the ALD-based hybrid resist synthesis has a potential for enabling high-performance EUV photoresist systems.", "Indium nitrate hydrate films are evaluated as potential extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resists. The uniformity and stability of indium nitrate-based sol-gel precursor films are studied as a function of metal composition, concentration, chemical sources, precursor dissolution time, post-application bake (PAB) conditions, and relative humidity during the deposition. 0.1 M indium nitrate solution forms a 20-nm thick resist, ideal for EUV lithography. We find two types of defects: macroscale defects that are visible under an optical microscope and nanoscale defects that can only be detected using an atomic force microscope. Both types of defects are affected by humidity and dissolution time and are likely due to indium nitrate crystals. Once formed, indium nitrate hydrate films show great stability with no changes in defect density up to 3 weeks. Using a 92-eV electron beam as a proxy for the EUV source, preliminary studies show exposed films become insoluble after 10 min exposure (8 mC/cm2 dose), acting as a negative-tone resist. Results of in-situ Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and residual gas analysis during the exposure show that the solubility switch is accompanied by the decomposition of nitrate species and the release of water.", "Research and development of EUV photoresists capable of supporting future requirements such as high-NA EUV continues. It is foreseen that, to contend with much higher photon-shot noise, resists will require high EUV absorbance to offset the need for thin films in high-NA, where depth of focus may be less than 20nm. We are developing a photoresist based on the multi-trigger concept, which seeks to suppress roughness using a new photoresist mechanism, and which is based on molecular rather than polymeric materials to maximize resolution. MTR Resist absorbance of greater than 18 \u03bcm-1 has been measured. Here we present recent NXE3400 results where, by modifying the PAG to optimize the reactions rates in the MTR mechanism, we have reduced the dose requirement compared to the orthodox high opacity MTR resists previously presented. Lines of 14 nm width at p28 nm can be patterned at a dose between 21 mJ/cm2 and 48 mJ/cm2 dependent on formulation ratio, with optimum LWR (3.9 nm, biased) occurring at 43 mJ/cm2 with a film thickness of 20.7 nm. Similarly, we present p34 pillars patterned between 21 mJ/cm2 and 59 mJ/cm2 doses for 17 nm diameter pillars, with a minimum LCDU for 19 nm diameter pillars of 3.05 nm occurring with a 21.7 nm FT at 58 mJ/cm2. The same resist can pattern p36 pillars at 52 mJ/cm2 with an LCDU of 3.44 nm at 18 nm diameter with no measured defects between 15.9 nm and 18.1 nm diameter. The impact of the substrate (such as use of various organic underlayers or SOG layers) on defectivity issues such as bridging or falling pillars will be presented here.", "The adoption of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) has enabled the manufacturing of semiconductor chips with circuit dimensions below 20nm. Photoresists used in the current EUVL are based on the extension of polymeric chemically amplified photoresist system initially introduced three decades ago. While having been the industry's workhorse since the deep UV era, its limitations have begun to emerge too. With requirements for line edge roughness (LER) approaching single nanometer and resolution falling below 15nm, the inherent large scale and inhomogeneity of polymeric systems lead to great technical challenges. Miniaturization of the building blocks of photoresist is desired for further scaling. In the meanwhile, the demand for higher throughput in lithography process due to the restriction of EUV source power requires faster photo-speed as well. In this study, a molecular resist platform is developed with the superior dose-to-size well below 50mJ/cm2. The resist forms negative-tone images which is beneficial for printing pillars and isolated lines utilizing dark-field masks. Pillars in hexagonal arrays with pitch below 38nm are patterned with local CD uniformity (LCDU) below 3nm. Thanks to its negative-tone nature, top loss of the resist film is minimal, which results in higher remaining film to sustain the subsequent etch process. The robust design of the molecular core renders the resist film enhanced etch resistance. Pattern transferring into over 15nm silicon layer was demonstrated using a simple stack. The new resists offer a more straightforward solution to print pillars and similar features without tone-inversion process. The negative-tone resists can be combined with the DSA technology to significantly improve cost of ownership. The processes were successfully implemented for both contact hole and line/space patterns with drastically improved pattern quality. LCDU of 1.4nm was achieved for contact hole pattern at pitch of 34nm in hexagonal array. It could be considered as an alternative to EUV double patterning or high-NA EUV processes.", "A single-component silsesquioxane (SQ)-based material was developed and investigated for patterning in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. This negative-tone SQ-material is soluble in the industry standard aqueous alkali developer 2.38wt% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Early experiments using electron beam (EB) lithography showed pattern capability in resolving 18nm line patterns (exposure dose: 2000 \u03bcC/cm2). After numerous screening evaluations using EB lithography, one variant was selected for patterning evaluation with EUV lithography. Patterning resolution was confirmed at 19nm line patterns (exposure dose: 200 mJ/cm2), with evidence of pattern modulation down to 15nm. As revealed in these preliminary patterning investigations, low sensitivity is the obvious issue. To understand the reaction mechanisms of this SQ-based material, various analyses were also carried out. Results reveal the occurrence of direct photo-crosslinking (no main scission) of Si-O-Si bonds from the decomposition of Si-OH components on exposure, resulting in insolubility in the developer solution (negative tone). Lastly, to address the sensitivity issue, the application of what we refer to as \u201cSensitivity Enhancer Unit\u201d was utilized. EB lithography results show an improvement in sensitivity indicating a possible solution to the low sensitivity issue. These results show the potential applicability of the single-component SQ-based patterning material for both EUV and EB lithography.", "A biomass EUV non-CAR type resist is proposed as a sustainable material for reducing CO2 emissions. It was demonstrated that HP 8 nm L/S pattern formation is required for a 1.5 nm node device with a biomass EUV resist. Furthermore, two approaches for improving the EUV lithography performance of biomass EUV resists are proposed: resist structure and lithography process improvement. The pattern quality was improved upon improving the resist structure. In addition, the lithography process [pre-exposure metal infiltration (PreMi) process and the new lithography process] improved the sensitivity of the biomass EUV resist. This proves that the biomass EUV resist can be used in high-NA EUV lithography at 8 nm.", "Extreme UV (EUV) lithography is entering full-scale production of high-end IC chips. This transition gives researchers in academia and industry ample motivation to propose new chemistries that will contribute to alleviating the resolution-line edge roughness-sensitivity trade-off dilemma of EUV lithography. We also have a great interest in the radical chemistry of carbon-fluorine bonds working under EUV and have explored its applicability as a platform for implementing novel EUV resists. While it was checked that the chemical concept is viable by using fluorinated small molecules and polymers, it needed to be upgraded in terms of patterning resolution and sensitivity. Recently, we extended successfully the radical-based strategy to the tin-oxo nano cluster resist concept. Soluble fluorinated tin-oxo clusters could be prepared, and they were cast into thin films from a fluorous solution. When the thin film was exposed to EUV radiation, it lost solubility, resulting in the formation of negative-tone images. Under an EUV lithographic condition, the thin film could be tailored down to 10 nm or smaller sized features. In addition, their unique solubility in chemically orthogonal solvents also enabled the build-up of a bilayer structure composed of a non-fluorinated reactive polymer underlayer without curing. The stacked film structure was found to be helpful for the sensitivity improvement. These results propose another interesting EUV resist candidate possessing unique capabilities in thin film processing.", "Polymeric photoresists are limited in their sensitivity, resolution, and line-edge roughness due in large part to their molar mass distribution and variation in composition of single polymer chains. While most synthetic polymers, have monomer units distributed randomly along the polymer chain, polypeptoids are, however, characterized by low stochastics i.e., identical chains with extremely low chemical, structural, and molar mass variability with a widely adjustable length and composition. In this work we describe the synthesis of 10 repeat-unit polypeptoids designed as a photopolymer and demonstrate their potential as CARs evaluated by electron-beam, DUV and extreme-UV lithography, obtaining well defined line-space patterns of less than 30 nm half-pitch.", "DUV photolithography, as the major process of nanofabrication, typically requires high volumes of toxic chemicals within resist formulation, solvent and developer. In this context, alternative chemistries to current petroleum-derived photoresists are proposed to reduce environmental impacts. Chitosan represents a bio-sourced resist allowing water-based patterning processes free of organic solvent and alkali-based developers, by substitution with a green solvent (deionized (DI) water). This paper present last stepwise process in the patterning integration with a chitosan-based resist. Preliminary results using a 300 mm pilot line scale at CEA-Leti demonstrate patterns resolution down to 800 nm along with plasma etch transfer into Si substrate. Finally, the environmental impact through life cycle analysis (LCA) of the whole process based on chitosan resist is assessed and compared to conventional solvent-based processes.", "Titanium nitride (TiN) combines plasmonic properties in the visible and near infrared spectral region with good mechanical properties, high thermal and chemical stability making it a very promising alternative to noble metals for optical applications at high temperature or in extreme environments. The authors present a new easy and fast process for the elaboration of micro-nanostructured TiN layers. This process combines photo-patternable TiO2 sol-gel by optical lithography and a nitridation process, by rapid thermal annealing (RTA). During this presentation, the elaboration of sol-gel, its structuring by different optical lithography methods, as well as its nitridation by RTA are presented.", "Infiltration synthesis of vapor-phase precursors is ex-situ route of converting established polymeric resists into hybrids. The concept initially modelled over polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-AlOx hybrid has been expanded to infiltrating several metal oxide moieties into high sensitivity resist (HSR). Beyond implementing single metal oxide species, alloyed infiltration is explored as a means to limit pattern roughness originating from granular crystallites. Lithography performance of these new generation of hybrid positive tone resists is assessed towards contact-hole patterning.", "As lithographic techniques advance in their capabilities of shrinking microelectronics devices, the need for improved resist materials, especially for extreme ultraviolet (EUV), has become increasingly pressing. In this work, we study the molecular layer deposition (MLD) of an Al-based hybrid thin film resist, known as \u201calucone,\u201d extending our previous research that tested the Hf-based hybrid thin film \u201chafnicone\u201d as an EUV resist. Alucone is grown at 100 \u00baC using the metal precursor trimethylaluminum and the organic precursor ethylene glycol. Like hafnicone, alucone behaves as a negative tone resist that can resolve 50-nm line widths, though preliminary data suggest that alucone\u2019s line patterns are more sharply defined than those of hafnicone. Whereas hafnicone\u2019s sensitivity is 400 \u03bcC/cm2 using 3 M HCl as the developer, alucone\u2019s sensitivity is not yet as good (4800 \u03bcC/cm2 using 0.125 M HCl). Our study of alucone offers new insight into structural features of an MLD film that can lead to desired EUV-responsive behavior. This insight may accelerate the development of vapor-deposited inorganic resists for use in electron-beam and EUV lithography.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology is one of the promising high volume manufacturing processes for devices below 7nm. However, the technology still has several issues for HVM. Especially, RLS (Resolution, LWR, and sensitivity) trade-off remains as one of the obvious problems for resist patterning. In which, resist resolution is one of the challenges to make fine pattern. For fine patterning, High NA EUV is predicted as one of candidate for enabling the future generation of device manufacturing. In this situation, investigation of chemically amplified resist (CAR) is being intensively conducted as one of candidate material for high-NA EUVL. However, CAR has one of key challenge for mask transfer because it is expected that thin resist film thickness is applied to exhibit good lithographic performance. As one of the solutions for this issue, we focused on the novel material which selectively makes a growth of the pattern.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This invited talk describes the enabling process technologies for advanced logic devices beyond FinFET era. Gate-all-around (GAA) improves electrostatics over FinFET and enables continuous gate length scaling. Complementary FET (CFET), which is a structure of stacked transistors, is a next candidate architecture for the continuous cell height scaling enablement. Interconnect pitch scaling will also play crucial role for it and go with RC reduction knobs such as Cu damascene extension, post Cu and airgap. For better area usage and performance enhancement, backside power delivery network (PDN) is an attractive option. For these enablement, continuous process and tool advancement is necessary not only on film, etch, lithography and wet, but also on wafer bonding and thinning technologies. We will also review our recent progress in EUV related solutions including self-aligned patterning.", "Semiconductor process development for state-of-the-art devices is a complex task that requires up to years of development. The complexity comes from the need to tune a significant number of process knobs in latest process tools, to meet multiple on-wafer performance targets, across an entire wafer. AppliedPRO\u00ae is a software and library of algorithms developed by Applied Materials for process recipe optimization to meet simultaneous process requirements across the entire wafer. The software is tailored to semiconductor use-cases and designed to be primarily used by process engineers to make critical decisions with confidence during process development. Over 100 use-cases have been generated for various semiconductor chips manufacturers, showing faster development time, less development resources, and higher process engineer productivity. This paper shows the use-case of Samsung N+1 Logic BEOL Spacer-Etch process recipe optimization using AppliedPRO\u00ae. We utilized AppliedPRO\u00ae structured design of experiment methodology and machine-learning algorithms to simultaneously model 10 process-recipe knobs of Applied Materials\u2019 Centris\u00ae Sym3\u00ae X Etch system and their effect on 8 on-wafer metrics, and determine optimal process knob conditions for minimizing Spacer-tail, which is a key performance metric, while keeping other metrics close to spec. These optimized conditions reduced Spacer-tail by 73% on coupons, which was also validated on full-wafer. These optimal results were previously unachievable in all the previous experimental trials before introducing AppliedPRO\u00ae.", "The impact of both intrinsic and plasma-induced stress of a TiN hardmask on line wiggling was investigated via etching of p-SiOCH with 28 nm pitch, line and space (L/S) EUV resist patterning. Experimental stacks included crystalline PVD TiN with an intrinsic stress of +0.1 GPa and several PEALD TiN films with varying crystallinity and intrinsic stresses ranging from -3.6 GPa (compressive) to +0.2 GPa (tensile). Results confirmed that reduction of intrinsic TiN stress can prevent wiggling1 when the mask is not exposed to plasma during process flow. However, when TiN is exposed to plasma as in a typical back end of line (BEOL) process2-3, compressive stress increased in all films and resulted in wiggling even in the patterned PVD TiN sample with low intrinsic stress. This global increase in compressive stress due to plasma exposure did not correlate with intrinsic stress values, therefore, this work suggests a greater focus should be placed on plasma-induced stress to avoid line wiggling when selecting a TiN film. Further investigation found that increased surface roughness of the TiN mask can decrease the risk of wiggling, and that surface roughness is influenced by p-SiOCH etch selectivity, indicating mask surface roughness should also be considered when evaluating line wiggling in BEOL, p-SiOCH etching.", "With the introduction of Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR) applications, the fabrication of photonics devices is approaching a high volume manufacturing level. To scale these products to consumer friendly dimensions, there is still significant shrink needed for many not yet available components such as ultrasmall cameras, metalenses, microdisplays, and combiner optics. AR/VR/MR optical components include metalenses patterned over large areas, and the fidelity of these patterns may have a significant impact on performance. In this study, we apply OPC to the design intent and examine the implication of various lithographic and correction techniques on metalens performance through simulation. In addition, we investigate the root causes of the manufacturing process variability and its impact on metalens functionality. These devices are analyzed by comparing light propagation through the simulated manufactured system using rigorous lithographic models to the optimal system based on the design intent. The study finds that the size and shape of meta-atoms have a different impact on optical performance, depending on the type of the metalens.", "In this work, process modeling was coupled with actual Si data to perform process optimization and control of an 18nm metal pitch (MP18) semi-damascene flow with fully self-aligned vias (FSAV). We explored the impact of process variations and patterning sensitivities on line and via resistances as well as on line capacitance variability. We also benchmarked capacitance variability using partial-airgap and gap fill options. From this study, we have identified significant process parameters and corresponding process windows that need to be controlled to ensure successful manufacturability of the MP18 semi-damascene flow.", "Patterning, a major process in semiconductor manufacturing, aims to transfer the design layout to the wafer. Accordingly, the \"process proximity correction\" method was developed to overcome the difference in after-cleaninginspected CD (critical dimension) between patterns of similar shapes. However, its physical model is often limited in the predictive performance. Therefore, recent studies have introduced ML (machine learning) technology to supplement model accuracy, but this approach often has an inherent risk of overfitting depending on the type of sampled pattern. In this study, we present a newly invented flow capable of stable etch-process-aware ML modeling by model reconstruction and large amounts of measurement data. The new modeling flow can also be performed within a reasonable runtime through efficient feature extraction. Based on the new model and its related layout targeting platform, intensive improvements were made to CD targeting and spread; for a given layout, in comparison with delicate rule-based modification, the CD targeting accuracy was improved by 4 times and approaches the limit of metrology error.", "The structuring of optical substrates gained more significance than ever before and many current and future applications challenge common production processes in respect to either grating or substrate geometry.

High density radical based processes provide ideal solutions with very low electron temperature, excellent step coverage and ultra-high selectivity. The highly reactive radicals can largely reduce thermal budget as well. In this article radical based surface treatments and material modifications including metal treatment, surface reduction and surface smoothing are discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of combining such surface treatment and radical based selective etch are also presented with examples of Si and TiN etch processes. Both surface treatment and selective etch processes are enabled by high density ICP plasmas generated radicals.", "There has been considerable interest in the development of isotropic atomic layer etching (ALE) for the conformal removal of thin films. Material selectivity is crucial for the development of isotropic ALE because the next generation of semiconductor devices will be constructed with miniaturized 3D structures using a variety of very thin films. We developed plasma-assisted thermal-cyclic ALE, which is a repetition of surface modification by plasma exposure and removal of the modified surface by infrared heating. We developed a 300-mm tool, namely, dry chemical removal (DCR), which is equipped with an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source and infrared lamps, to facilitate rapid thermal desorption of the modified surface. An important feature of the plasma-assisted thermal-cyclic ALE is that it has more tuning knobs than that of conventional ALE because it uses two temperatures: a low temperature for surface modification and an elevated temperature for the removal of the modified surface. This paper presents the selective ALE of various materials, i.e., Si3N4, TiN, W, and SiGe using the developed tool. The mechanisms of the selectivity are divided into two categories: formation of an ammonium salt-based modified layer and selectivity control by adjusting the infrared heating time. This paper reviews the selective ALE mechanisms, focusing on the results of in situ analysis of surface reactions, and presents some of the latest findings.", "Sustainability is gaining momentum as countries and companies announce targets for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. imec has created a bottom-up model using tool data, process recipes, and integrated wafer process flows to create a virtual fab. With this model, it is possible to quantify the environmental impact of manufacturing integrated circuit (IC) chips for current and future logic and memory technology modes. In this paper, the model is used to identify areas with the highest environmental impact. It is important to reduce the impact of both lithography and etch since together they are responsible for 45% of total CO2 equivalent emissions associated with fabricating an N3 logic node wafer. For lithography, two approaches to reducing the environmental impact will be described: one concentrates on tool consumption and the other on process choices to maximize throughput. For etch, the focus is on reducing overall gas consumption and improving wafer material stacks to minimize fluorocarbon use. Translating patterning process changes into emission numbers will enable informed process choices for future and contribute to a shift towards net-zero semiconductor manufacturing.", "Fluorinated species are ubiquitous in semiconductor manufacturing, yet are known to have global warming potentials thousands of times higher than CO2. As abatement technologies are not completely effective and add additional costs, interest in reducing these emissions increases with semiconductor manufacturing volumes. We explore alternative chemistries for common plasma etch applications that retain patterning performance but with near zero GWP. Spectroscopic identification and quantification of etch byproducts is presented to demonstrate the beneficial environmental impacts of transitioning from the most common etch gasses.", "The recent passing of the CHIPS act has highlighted the semiconductor industry as a driver of innovation. Simultaneously, environmental legislation regarding per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) usage has become a major focus in both the US and EU, which has potential implications for many hydro- and perfluorocarbon (HFC/PFC) gases currently used in semiconductor manufacturing. High-aspect ratio (HAR) etch processes are a critical component of two high-growth manufacturing areas (packaging and solid-state memory), however, they are significant consumers of HFC/PFC chemistries due to the vertical scale of the features involved. This paper analyzes reduced gas flow effects in a HAR through-silicon via (TSV) etch process, with the aim of improving the sustainability of future processes through an improved mechanistic understanding. We demonstrate a cyclic C4F8 /SF6 TSV process with ~90% ER and comparable sidewall roughness using 50% of the SF6 flow rate and 60% of the passivation time. We also show through TOF-SIMS analysis a depth dependence of the sulfur and fluorocarbon concentrations on the TSV sidewall which varies with gas flow rate, providing further insight into the mechanisms associated with HAR etching.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology empowers integrated circuit industry to mass produce chips with smaller pitches and higher density. Along with EUV tool advancement, significant progress has also been made in the development and advancement of EUV chemically amplified resist (CAR) materials, which allows for the improvement of resolution, line edge roughness, and sensitivity (RLS) trade-off. The scarce number of EUV photons has triggered the development of resist material with high absorption at 13.5 nm. However, a review of open literature reveals very limited reports on the effect of high EUV absorption elements on etch properties of advanced EUV resist. To ensure Moore\u2019s Law continues to move forward, further resist performance improvement is required. In this regard, stochastic defects originating from photon shot noise, materials, and processing variabilities present a unique challenge for the extension of CAR platform for the patterning of smaller nodes. Notably, less attention has been paid to defects formed during the etching process used for pattern transfer. In this paper, we report on the relationship between resist make-up and etch properties. In particular, the effect of incorporation of EUV high absorbing elements are examined. New resist material design strategies for continuous improvement of EUV CAR lithographic performance will be discussed.", "", "", "", "In today\u2019s advanced semiconductor process manufacturing, critical dimensions of device features have decreased to a few nanometers while the aspect ratios have increased beyond 100. The cost of process development has significantly increased and the performance of the lithography and plasma etch patterning processes are critical to the success of ramping a new technology node toward profitable high-volume manufacturing. In this paper, a three-dimensional Monte Carlo-based feature scale model, ProETCH\u00ae, has been developed for modeling etch process with the capability of optimizing the process by solving forward and inverse problems. The shallow trench isolation etch process in self-aligned double patterning was investigated. The mechanism of silicon etch by Ar/Cl2 plasma was developed with experimental data as a reference. The developed model captures the trends and has quantitative accuracy in comparison to the experimental data, and can be used to identify the different fundamental pathways which contribute to the profile metrics. The developed model was then used to solve the forward problem, which is to predict profiles at different process conditions, and the inverse problem, which is to search for the process conditions (e.g, power and pressure) which could result in desirable profiles.", "The etch profile control for the amorphous carbon layer (ACL) is an important step in the 3D NAND fabrication process. Because ACL is the mask material for defining the pattern of the high-aspect-ratio-contact (HARC) dielectric ONON layer etch process, precise control of its etch profile is necessary. Specifically, an ideal ACL mask profile should be free of symptoms such as hole circularity distortion, profile twisting, bowing, and undercutting. In order to achieve this desired etch performance, knowledge of various etch contributing factors must be systematically derived and applied, including etch surface chemistry, high-aspect-ratio (HAR) etchant transport, ion flux and ion energy angle distribution function (EADF) control, etc. In this work, we investigate the ACL etch fundamental characteristics through combined 2D chamber-scale plasma simulations with the hybrid plasma-equipment model (HPEM) and 3D etch profile simulations with the Monte-Carlo Feature Profile Model (MCFPM) for an inductively-coupled-plasma (ICP) reactor with RF bias at the substrate. In particular, we focus on the profile trends under different reactant fluxes and energies. Our findings indicate that maintaining a neutral-starved (ion-rich) etch regime is essential for mitigating both the channel hole etch circularity distortion and the slit etch profile twisting. To achieve this desired etch regime, the HAR ion, and neutral transport must controlled by the RF bias power and frequency, substrate temperature, etc. Furthermore, especially in this neutral-limited etch regime which is necessary for distortion and twisting mitigation, the control of the consequent aspect-ratio dependent etching (ARDE), as well as maintaining the critical dimension (CD) and reducing bowing and undercutting are also necessary. For this purpose, atomistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been applied to compare the reaction energetics for various ALD-like sidewall passivation chemistries. Specifically, we propose a new process based on its favorable reaction energetics. Experimental cross-section images have matched simulation results. In conclusion, our insights have provided guidance for process optimization and tool design to meet industrial demands.", "Reducing process development time and speeding up time to market are perennial challenges in the microelectronics industry. The development of etch models that permit optimizations across the wafer would enable manufacturers to optimize process design flows and predict process defects before a single wafer is run. The challenges of across-wafer uniformity optimizations include the large variety of features across the wafer, etch variations that occur at multiple scales within the plasma chamber, feature metrology, and computationally expensive model development. Compounding these challenges are trade-offs between data quality and time/cost-effectiveness, the wide variety of measurement information provided by different tools, and the sparsity and inconsistency of human-collected data. We address these challenges with a feature and wafer level modeling approach. First, experiments are conducted for a variety of etch conditions (e.g., pressure, gas composition, flow rate, temperature, power, and bias). Second, a feature level model is calibrated at multiple sites across the wafer based on OCD and/or cross-sectional SEM measurements. Finally, the calibrated model is used to predict an optimal set of process conditions to preserve uniformity across the wafer and to meet recipe targets. We demonstrate the methodology using SandBox Studio\u2122 AI for a FinFET application. Specifically, we show the rapid and automated calibration of feature level models using experimental measurements of the 3D feature etch at a variety of process conditions. Automated image segmentation of X-SEM data is also performed here for single case using Weave\u00ae to demonstrate how such data can be acquired quickly in a development environment. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of the reduced-order model to predict optimal recipe conditions to improve overall recipe performance. We show how, with this hybrid-metrology computational approach, a process window that yields 89.2% of the wafer can be captured.", "In a complementary-FET (CFET), n- and p- type transistors are stacked on top of each other. This stacking approach results in very high aspect ratio vertical features which brings critical challenges for nanosheet (NSH), gate, spacer, and source/drain (S/D) cavity patterning. Silicon nitride spacers are commonly used to electrically isolate and protect the silicon gate during S/D epitaxial growth and to precisely define the channel length (Lg) [1-4]. In this work, we will discuss the spacer film opening, the optimization of the S/D cavity profile and propose options to reduce the gate hard mask consumption. We were able to straighten the S/D cavity profile in the SiGe superlattice substrate by tuning specific process parameters, during the various etch and over-etch steps of the stack. Chemical analysis of the sidewall of the cavity, by TEM/EDS, confirmed that the formation of a passivation oxi-nitride compound is key to achieve vertical cavity profile. The chemical mapping of the cavity was done through the Si and SiGe25% sheets. A Si, O and N containing passivation layer is present in the cavity which seems to be thicker at the top and thinner at the bottom of the cavity. Furthermore, polymer capping methods were investigated to reduce the consumption of oxide hard mask (HM) during spacer etch. Process optimization for the cavity shape in the S/D recess etch was conducted using TEM characterization.", "In this paper, middle-of-line (MOL) plasma etch development results for the monolithic CFET integration with nanosheet devices using scaling-relevant test vehicle (CPP48nm) are presented. Several critical MOL patterning steps are addressed, with the focus on the patterning of the trenches (M0) for contacting to the bottom and top devices. The patterning of M0A consists of SiO2 dielectric and thin SiN liner etch landing on epitaxial source drain (S/D). The critical M0 etch requirement is preserving the SiN gate spacer to avoid shorting between S/D and gate. Due to no-gate plug implementation in the process flow, the etch development must rely on very challenging, patterning the small critical dimension (CD) contacts to create enough dielectric barrier between the metal contact and the gate, and preferably, also very challenging, self-alignment to the thin gate spacer. The dependance of the M0 CD and the etch depth is accessed by using the range of the EUV lithography conditions and evaluating the maximum etch depth of the trench as a function of the printed CD. The minimum trench CD achieved on the bottom of the trench is ~ 13nm, and the minimum top CD in the range of ~ 16nm, with the evident etch non-uniformity observed in the etch depth. The trend of larger contact CD resulting in the deeper etch and process uniformity improvement is observed. Etch depth larger than 100nm is achieved when top M0 CD is >20nm. The option with the SiN liner deposition followed by SiN liner etch (spacer formation) post- M0 SiO2 is developed. This patterning sequence consists of SiO2 etch stopping on the thin SiN (over S/D) followed by additional SiN deposition and finally etching of the deposited SiN liner as well as SiN liner covering S/D. The option with SiN spacer formation minimizes the risk of short to the gate, due to extra SiN dielectric film protecting the gate. In addition, we present the results for another critical MOL patterning step, i.e., HAR metal recess post M0 metallization (AR~11)", "", ""], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
