A technology update of key components of a 100 W LPP-EUV light source is given in this paper. The key components efficiently produce a stable plasma and evacuate the tin debris from the EUV vessel with a magnetic debris mitigation system. The chosen technology guarantees therefore a high-power and long-life EUV light source system. Each component is described with updated data. The latest system performance results are also presented. They were obtained from our proto LPP-EUV light systems which support 100 W output power.", "The defect on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask can cause image quality degradation on the wafer and also poses a serious problem for achieving high volume manufacturing (HVM). Using a pellicle could decrease the critical size of a defect by taking the defect away from the focal plane of a mask. Considering the double pass transmission for the thickness of extreme ultraviolet lithography EUVL pellicle should be ~ nm thin. For ~ nm thin pellicle, the thermal stress by EUV light exposure may damage the pellicle. Therefore, an investigation of thermal stress is desired for reliable EUV light transmission through pellicle. Therefore, we calculated the total stress and compared with material maximum stress of the pellicle. Breaking or the safety of the pellicle could be determined by the induced total stress, however, the cyclic exposure heating could decrease the material maximum stress of the pellicle. The c-Si (crystalline silicon) has good mechanical durability than the p-Si (poly-crystalline silicon) under cyclic thermal exposure.", "The development of technology infrastructure for EUV Lithography (EUVL) still requires higher levels of technology readiness in many fields. A large number of new materials will need to be introduced. For example, development of EUV compatible pellicles to adopt an approved method from optical lithography for EUVL needs completely new thin membranes which have not been available before. To support these developments, PTB with its decades of experience [1] in EUV metrology [2] provides a wide range of actinic and non actinic measurements at in-band EUV wavelengths as well as out of band. Two dedicated, complimentary EUV beamlines [3] are available for radiometric [4,5] characterizations benefiting from small divergence or from adjustable spot size respectively. The wavelength range covered reaches from below 1 nm to 45 nm [6] for the EUV beamlines [7] to longer wavelengths if in addition the VUV beamline is employed. The standard spot size is 1 mm by 1 mm with an option to go as low as 0.1 mm to 0.1 mm. A separate beamline offers an exposure setup. Exposure power levels of 20 W/cm2 have been employed in the past, lower fluencies are available by attenuation or out of focus exposure. Owing to a differential pumping stage, the sample can be held under defined gas conditions during exposure. We present an updated overview on our instrumentation and analysis capabilities for EUV metrology and provide data for illustration.", "EUV lithography (EUVL) is well known to be a strong candidate for next generation, single exposure sub-30nm halfpitch lithography.[1] Furthermore, high-NA EUV exposure tool(s) released two years ago gave a strong impression by finer pattern results. On the other hand, it seems that the coat-develop track process remains very similar and in many aspects returns to KrF or ArF dry process fundamentals, but in practice a 26-32nm pitch patterning coat develop track process also has challenges with EUV resists. As access to EUV lithography exposures has become more readily available over the last five (5) years, several challenges and accomplishments in the track process have been reported, such as the improvement of ultra-thin film coating, CD uniformity, defectivity, line width roughness (LWR), and so on.[2-8] The coat-develop track process has evolved along with novel materials and metrology capability. Line width roughness (LWR) control and defect reduction are demonstrated utilizing the SOKUDO DUO coat-develop track system with ASML NXE:3100 and NXE:3300 exposures in the IMEC (Leuven, Belgium) cleanroom environment. Additionally, we will show the latest lithographic results obtained by novel processing approaches in the EUV coat develop track system.", "Ionizing radiations such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and electron beam (EB) are the most promising exposure source for next-generation lithographic technology. In the realization of high resolution lithography, it is necessary for resist materials to improve the trade-off relationship among sensitivity, resolution, and line width roughness (LWR). In order to overcome them, it is essential to understand basic chemistry of resist matrices in resist processes. In particular, the dissolution process of resist materials is a key process. Therefore, it is essential for next-generation resist design for ionizing radiation to clarify the dissolution behavior of the resist film into developer. However, the details in dissolution process of EUV and EB resist films have not been investigated thus far. In this study, main chain scission and dissolution behavior of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as main chain scission type resist was investigated using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in order to understand the relationship between the degree of PMMA degradation and dissolution behavior. The relationship between the molecular weight after irradiation and the swelling behavior was clarified.", "We develop a new simulation code for the optimization of efficiency of the laser pumped plasma (LPP) extreme ultra violet (EUV) light source, which is applicable to the pre-plasma formation from a tin droplet target irradiated by a pre-pulse laser. We investigate algorithms of reorganization of the mesh for the Lagrangian hydrodynamics simulation. We also investigate the model of the liquid to gas phase transition to calculate the dynamics of particle formation through the laser ablation.", "The imaging quality of the projection optics of an extreme ultraviolet lithography scanner degrades under the influence of thermally induced deformations of its mirrors. Wavefronts of different reticle points encounter different parts of the deformed mirrors, resulting in a field dependent wavefront error. This paper presents how ideas from multi-conjugate adaptive optics can be used to reduce these thermally induced aberrations. To this end a generic deformable mirror model is implemented. Linear actuator sensitivities are derived directly, based on nominal ray locations and directions, enabling fast prototyping. An integrated opto-thermo-mechanical mirror heating model is used to determine the evolution of thermally induced abberations over time. This transient simulation is used to analyze four different adaptive optics configurations and two different control algorithms. It is shown that by employing the multi-objective goal-attainment method, it is possible to improve the optical performance significantly when compared to minimizing the \u21132-norm of the total residual wavefront error vector.", "The suppression of outgassing from the EUV resist is one of the significant challenges, which has to be addressed for realizing EUV lithography (EUVL). The outgassing might be the main contributor involved in the contamination of the mirror optics in scanners. This may result in reflectivity losses. The pragmatic outgassing test that utilizes the witness sample (WS) was used as a general method to quantify the outgassing level for commercially available chemically amplified resists (CAR). There are two types of contaminations. The first type of contamination involves a cleanable contamination that mainly comprises hydrocarbons that can be removed by the hydrogen radical cleaning. Another type of contamination includes the noncleanable contamination that remains on the WS even after hydrogen radical cleaning. Several outgas qualification results were evaluated at the EIDEC [1, 2]. The data indicated that contaminations by the CAR mainly comprised the cleanable contaminations. The data also indicated that there were almost negligible noncleanable contaminations from the CAR. EUV resist communities accelerate the development of high sensitivity resists to compensate the low power of the EUV source. Nonchemically amplified resist (nonCAR) with a new platform is a candidate for high sensitivity resists. The nonCAR includes some types of metal elements with high absorbance for EUV light. There is very limited research on the outgassing characteristics of the nonCAR. In this study, we considered an EUV exposure process in the actual EUV scanner and EUV resists were exposed in a hydrogen environment. A potential risk could result from the reaction of the hydrogen radicals generated by the EUV light with the metal elements in the nonCAR and the metal hydride outgases from the resist. This would result in a noncleanable contamination on the EUV mirror [3]. The knowledge with respect to outgassing from an organic metal complex is insufficient even in a vacuum condition. Hence, the study involved the preparation of certain types of organic metal complexes as model materials. Then, the outgassing evaluations for the materials were carried out as a fundamental studies in a vacuum condition. The results were reported in this study.", "The extreme-ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) has been regarded as the best candidate to achieve high resolution patterning below 1x nm node. From the Rayleigh criterion, a numerical aperture (NA) should be increased to make the high resolution pattern. A new absorber structure which has sufficient image contrast and small height is needed for realization of high NA optics. In this study, 28 nm-thick ruthenium oxide (RuO2) is suggested for the absorber material. We could obtain higher image contrast and better H-V bias by using the RuO2 absorber compared to the other materials such as TaN and TaBN.", "Pupil plane characterization will play a critical role in image process optimization for EUV lithography (EUVL), as it has for several lithography generations. In EUVL systems there is additional importance placed on understanding the ways that thermally-induced system drift affect pupil variation during operation. In-situ full pupil characterization is therefore essential for these tools. To this end we have developed Quick Inverse Pupil (QUIP)\u2014a software suite developed for rapid characterization of pupil plane behavior based on images formed by that system. The software consists of three main components: 1) an image viewer, 2) the model builder, and 3) the wavefront analyzer. The image viewer analyzes CDSEM micrographs or actinic mask micrographs to measure either CDs or through-focus intensity volumes. The software is capable of rotation correction and image registration with subpixel accuracy. The second component pre-builds a model for a particular imaging system to enable rapid pupil characterization. Finally, the third component analyzes the results from the image viewer and uses the optional pre-built model for inverse solutions of pupil plane behavior. Both pupil amplitude and phase variation can be extracted using this software. Inverse solutions are obtained through a model based algorithm which is built on top of commercial rigorous full-vector simulation software.", "As the lithographic resolution in semiconductor device manufacturing increases photoresist thickness cannot keep the same pace because of limitations set by pattern transfer. This leads to an increase in aspect ratios of patterned resist structures which in turn gives rise to pattern collapse that prevents the use of the patterned features for pattern transfer. Pattern collapse is caused by the capillary forces present on the resist surface during drying of the wafer. Therefore the best approach for mitigating pattern collapse is the complete removal of any drying steps from the processing of wafers after the lithography has been carried out. Several techniques achieving this have been presented. In this paper we propose a bottom-up strategy for pattern collapse mitigation where the wafers are brought from rinsing to further processing steps while they are still wet, thus avoiding the drying-induced pattern collapse without introducing additional processing steps.", "EUV photons expose photoresists by complex interactions including photoionization to create primary electrons (~80 eV), and subsequent ionization steps that create secondary electrons (10-60 eV). The mechanisms by which these electrons interact with resist components are key to optimizing the performance of EUV resists and EUV lithography as a whole. As these photoelectrons and secondary electrons are created, they deposit their energy within the resist, creating ionized atoms along the way. Because many photo- and secondary electrons can escape the resist through the surface, resists can become charged. Charging and energy deposition profiles within the resist may play a role in the sensitivity and line-edge roughness of EUV resists. In this paper, we present computational analysis of charging-influenced electron behavior in photoresists using LESiS (Low energy Electron Scattering in Solids), a software developed to understand and model electron-matter interactions. We discuss the implementation of charge and tracking and the model used to influence electron behavior. We also present the potential effects of charging on EUV and electron beam lithography by investigating secondary electron blur in charging and non-charging models.", "Even though EUV lithography has extremely short wavelength source, a high numerical aperture(NA) system larger than 0.5 is required to make fine pattern of 1X nm and below. In order to avoid reflective efficiency loss and increase of chief ray angle of incident light, anamorphic high NA is suggested. Suggested anamorphic NA system has non-isotropic magnification which is varied 4X to 8X and the mask NA shape is ellipse due to non-isotropic magnification distribution. Anamorphic NA system has a non-conventional shadow effect due to non-isotropic incident angle distribution and magnification. These non-isotropic characteristics leads the reduction of asymmetric shadow distribution and it involves the reduction of horizontal-vertical bias. As a result anamorphic NA system can achieve balanced patterning results regardless of pattern direction and incident direction.", "By 2015 EUV pellicle development has made significant progress such that it is mature enough for production testing. To support the implementation of the pellicle, the current EUV Inner Pod (EIP) design is modified to accommodate the addition of a pellicle to the reticle, which primarily involves adding a pellicle pocket to the baseplate of the EIP. Working closely with an EUV lithography customer, Entegris has developed a pellicle-compatible EUV inner pod that has passed this customer\u2019s testing. This paper presents the key design features of the Entegris pellicle-compatible EUV pod and the testing results. The non-pellicle EIP baseplate is a flat plate and is designed to maintain a very small distance from the underside (also pattern side) of the reticle. In the pellicle-compatible version a pocket is added to the baseplate to accommodate the pellicle and its frame. For compatibility purpose, the weight of the pellicle-compatible baseplate is kept about the same as the non-pellicle baseplates. In addition, considering that both non-pellicle and pellicalized reticles are going to be used by end users, a feature on the backside of the baseplate that\u2019s different between the two versions is going to be used by a sensor in the lithography tool to tell whether it is a pellicle or non-pellicle pod. Test results from several critical defectivity tests are highlighted in this paper including: full system cycle test, reticle handling tests, venting tests, EIP outgassing tests, along with pod shipping test.", "A reproducible measurement of in-band EUV power over time is essential in EUV lithography, e.g. for dose control, for monitoring the transmission of (parts of) the optical path and for detecting changes in EUV source performance. However, all currently available sensors suffer from sensitivity degradation over time due to photon-induce d contamination and/or structural degradation. For instance, a growing carbon layer on a sensor surface, as may be deposited during exposure to EUV, inhibits detection of an increasingly significant fraction of the EUV power. To minimize a change of sensor response over time, TNO is developing a carbon-contamination-tolerant EUV power sensor that can operate under typical EUV vacuum conditions. The sensor uses the photo-electric effect to distinguish between in- and out-of-band EUV. The sensor concept has been tested in the EUV beam line at TNO using a Xe discharge produced plasma (DPP) EUV source. Here, we present the latest experimental results, showing the time-resolved response of the sensor to the EUV pulse. A spectral purity filter was used to compare the sensor response to the full source spectrum output and to typical Xe DPP EUV emission lines (wavelength range 10-20 nm) only. The EUV signature in the sensor signal was clearly recognizable in both cases. The normalized observed EUV pulse power reproducibility was \u03c3/\u03bc = 23%, reflecting the typical EUV-emission power fluctuations of this Xe DPP EUV source.", "Thirty years have passed since the very first results of EUV imaging were made public by Kinoshita and co-workers of NTT Japan. Why does it take this long for EUV lithography to develop from infancy to near maturity? First, the advent and adoption of several key resolution-enhancing techniques along the way, combined with continual improvements in exposure tools, masks, and materials, greatly extended the life of optical lithography and made the need for EUVL less urgent, until now. Second, technological barriers that must be surmounted in order to put EUVL in manufacturing have indeed been high. In this presentation, I will review the early history of EUVL, point out how its life was extended beyond the initial phase of promising results, and present some most recent progress on the performance of its exposure tools, technology infrastructure, and patterning capability, and hopefully convince the audience that the technology is crossing the threshold to become a mainstream patterning technology for sub-10-nm generations of integrated circuits.", "Imprint lithography has been shown to be an effective technique for replication of nano-scale features. Jet and Flash* Imprint Lithography (J-FIL*) involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. Criteria specific to any lithographic process for the semiconductor industry include overlay, throughput and defectivity. The purpose of this paper is to describe the technology advancements made overlay, throughput and defectivity and to introduce the FPA-1200NZ2C cluster system designed for high volume manufacturing of semiconductor devices. in the reduction of particle adders in an imprint tool and introduce the new mask replication tool that will enable the fabrication of replica masks with added residual image placement errors suitable for memory devices with half pitches smaller than 15nm. Overlay results better than 5nm 3sigma have been demonstrated. To further enhance overlay, wafer chucks with improved flatness have been implemented to reduce distortion at the wafer edge. To address higher order corrections, a two part solution is discussed. An array of piezo actuators can be applied to enable linear corrections. Additional reductions in distortion can then be addressed by the local heating of a wafer field. The NZ2C cluster platform for high volume manufacturing is also discussed. System development continues this year with a target for introduction later in 2016. The first application is likely to be NAND Flash memory, and eventual use for DRAM and logic devices as both overlay and defectivity improve.", "Technologies for pattern fabrication using Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) process are being developed for various devices. NIL is an attractive and promising candidate for its pattern fidelity toward 1z device fabrication without additional usage of double patterning process. Layout dependent hotspots become a significant issue for application in small pattern size device, and design for manufacturing (DFM) flow for imprint process becomes significantly important. In this paper, simulation of resist spread in fine pattern of various scales are demonstrated and the fluid models depending on the scale are proposed. DFM flow to prepare imprint friendly design, issues for sub-20 nm NIL are proposed.", "Imprint lithography has been shown to be an effective technique for replication of nano-scale features. Jet and Flash* Imprint Lithography (J-FIL*) involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. There are two critical components to meeting throughput requirements for imprint lithography. Using a similar approach to what is already done for many deposition and etch processes, imprint stations can be clustered to enhance throughput. The FPA-1200NZ2C is a four station cluster system designed for high volume manufacturing. For a single station, throughput includes overhead, resist dispense, resist fill time (or spread time), exposure and separation. Resist exposure time and mask/wafer separation are well understood processing steps with typical durations on the order of 0.10 to 0.20 seconds. To achieve a total process throughput of 15 wafers per hour (wph) for a single station, it is necessary to complete the fluid fill step in 1.5 seconds. For a throughput of 20 wph, fill time must be reduced to only one second. There are several parameters that can impact resist filling. Key parameters include resist drop volume (smaller is better), system controls (which address drop spreading after jetting), Design for Imprint or DFI (to accelerate drop spreading) and material engineering (to promote wetting between the resist and underlying adhesion layer). In addition, it is mandatory to maintain fast filling, even for edge field imprinting. In this paper, we address the improvements made in all of these parameters to enable a 1.50 second filling process for a sub-20nm device like pattern and have demonstrated this capability for both full fields and edge fields.", "A low cost alternative lithographic technology is desired to meet with the decreasing feature size of semiconductor devices. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is one of the candidates for alternative lithographic technologies. NIL has advantages such as good resolution, critical dimension (CD) uniformity and smaller line edge roughness (LER). 4 On the other hand, NIL involves some risks. Defectivity is the most critical issue in NIL. The progress in the defect reduction on templates shows great improvement recently. In other words, the defect reduction of the NIIL process is a key to apply NIL to mass production. In this paper, we describe the evaluation results of the defect performance of NIL using an up-to-date tool, Canon FPA-1100 NZ2, and discuss the future potential of NIL in terms of defectivity. The impact of various kinds defects, such as the non-filling defect, plug defect, line collapse, and defects on replica templates are discussed. We found that non-fill defects under the resist pattern cause line collapse. It is important to prevent line collapse. From these analyses based on actual NIL defect data on long-run stability, we will show the way to reduce defects and the possibility of NIL in device high volume mass production. For the past one year, we have been are collaborating with SK Hynix to bring this promising technology into mainstream manufacturing. This work is the result of this collaboration.", "Imprint lithography has been shown to be an effective technique for replication of nano-scale features.

Hard particles on a wafer or mask create the possibility of creating a permanent defect on the mask that can impact device yield and mask life. By using material methods to reduce particle shedding and by introducing an air curtain system, test stand results demonstrate the potential for extending mask life to better than 1000 wafers. Additionally, a new replication tool, the FPA-1100 NR2 is introduced. Mask chuck flatness simulation results were also performed and demonstrate that residual image placement errors can be reduced to as little as 1nm.", "Roll-to-Roll-UV-nanoimprint lithography (R2R-UV-NIL) enables high resolution large area patterning of flexible substrates and is therefore of increasing industrial interest. We have set up a custom-made R2R-UV-NIL pilot machine which is able to convert 10 inch wide web with velocities of up to 30 m/min. In addition, we have developed self-replicable UV-curable resins with tunable surface energy and Young\u2019s modulus for UV-imprint material as well as for polymer working stamp/shim manufacturing. Now we have designed test patterns for the evaluation of the impact of structure shape, critical dimension, pitch, depth, side wall angle and orientation relative to the web movement onto the imprint fidelity and working shim life time. We have used female (recessed structures) silicon masters of that design with critical dimensions between CD = 200 nm and 1600 nm, and structure depths of d = 500 nm and 1000 nm - all with vertical as well as inclined side walls. These entire master patterns have been transferred onto single male (protruding structures) R2R polymer working shims. The polymer working shims have been used for R2R-UV-NIL runs of several hundred meters and the imprint fidelity and process stability of the various test patterns have been compared. This study is intended as a first step towards establishing of design rules and developing of nanoimprint proximity correction strategies for industrial R2R-UV-NIL processes using polymer working shims.", "Full-field, physically-based simulation of nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is needed to address the throughput-versus-yield challenges that are currently faced by NIL. We demonstrate a simulation framework that can track the spreading and coalescence of tens of thousands of picoliter-volume resin droplets beneath a nanoimprint template, predicting evolution of feature filling and residual layer thickness (RLT) uniformity during the imprinting of geometrically complex designs such as found in solid-state memory. We have used the framework to explore directionality of droplet spreading beneath patterned templates, the role of template curvature in mitigating gas entrapment, and detrimental elastic deflections at wafer-edge partial imprint fields.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) is one of the candidates for next generation lithography. Over the past few years, cylindrical and lamellar structures dictated by the block co-polymer (BCP) composition have been investigated for use in patterning contact holes or lines, and, Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL is a registered trademark or a trademark of Tokyo Electron Limited in Japan and /or other countries.) has presented the evaluation results and the advantages of each-1-5. In this report, we will present the latest results regarding the defect reduction work on a model line/space system. Especially it is suggested that the defectivity of the neutral layer has a large impact on the defectivity of the DSA patterns. Also, LER/LWR reduction results will be presented with a focus on the improvements made during the etch transferring the DSA patterns into the underlayer.", "This manuscript shows the relationship between defectivity of a typical chemo-epitaxy sequence and the DSA-specific materials, namely the mat, the brush and the block co-polymer. We demonstrate that the density of assembly defects in a line-space DSA flow, namely the dislocations and 1-period bridges have a direct correlation to certain parameters in the synthesis sequence of these materials. The primary focus of this manuscript is on identifying, controlling and reproducing the defects-critical parameters in the block co-polymer synthesis process for a stable and low defect performance of DSA flows.", "In next generation lithography to make sub-15nm pattern, Directed self-assembly (DSA) and Nano-imprint lithography (NIL) are proposed. The current DSA process is complicated and it is difficult to decrease width and line edge roughness of a guide pattern for sub-15nm patterning. In the case of NIL, it is difficult to make the master template having sub- 15nm pattern. This paper describes cost-effective lithography process for making sub-15nm pattern using DSA on a guide pattern replicated by Nano-imprinting (NIL + DSA). Simple process for making sub-15nm pattern is proposed. The quartz templates are made and line/space patterns of half pitch (hp) 12nm and hp9.5nm are obtained by NIL + DSA.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) has become a promising patterning technique for 7nm node hole shrink process due to its material-controlled CD uniformity and process simplicity.[1] For such application, cylinder-forming BCP system has been extensively investigated compared to its counterpart, lamella-forming system, mainly because cylindrical BCPs will form multiple vias in non-circular guiding patterns (GPs), which is considered to be closer to technological needs.[2-5] This technological need to generate multiple DSA domains in a bar-shape GP originated from the resolution limit of lithography, i.e. those vias placed too close to each other will merge and short the circuit. In practice, multiple patterning and self-aligned via (SAV) processes have been implemented in semiconductor manufacturing to address this resolution issue.[6] The former approach separates one pattern layer with unresolvable dense features into several layers with resolvable features, while the latter approach simply utilizes the superposition of via bars and the pre-defined metal trench patterns in a thin hard mask layer to resolve individual vias, as illustrated in Fig 1 (upper). With proper design, using DSA to generate via bars with the SAV process could provide another approach to address the resolution issue.", "Recent industrial results around directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) have demonstrated the high potential of such technique. One of the main advantages of this method is the reduction of lithographic steps thus leading to cost reduction. At the same time, the associated correction for mask creation must account for the introduction of this new technique maintaining a high level of accuracy and reliability. In order to create a Vertical Interconnect Layer (VIA) layer, graphoepitaxy DSA is the main candidate. The technique relies on the creation of a confinement guide where the BCP can separate into distinct regions and the resulting patterns are etched in order to obtain an ordered contact layer. The printing of the guiding pattern requires a classical lithography and optical proximity correction (OPC) to obtain the best suited guiding pattern for a specific target. Thus it is necessary to perform simulations of the BCP behavior in order to correctly determine contact hole placement. However, most existing models which simulates the BCP phase segregation have a computational cost that is too high and cannot be used to efficiently correct a full layout. In this study, we propose an original compact model that resolves this issue. The model is based on the calculation of the density probability of PMMA (Polymethyl Methacrylate) domain centers (figure 1). It is compared with both rigorous simulations (based on the Otha-Kawasaki model) and experiments as shown in figure 2. For this analysis, test cases are contact shrink and contact multiplication. The number of PMMA domains inside a structure is also discussed and an analytic formula is derived and compared to experiments (figure 3). The overall consistency of the compact model is presented.", "In this paper, we present a DSA compliant flow for contact/via layers with immersion lithography assuming the grapho-epitaxy process for cylinders\u2019 formation. We demonstrate that the DSA technology enablement needs co-optimization among material, design, and lithography. We show that the number of DSA grouping constructs is countable for the gridded-design architecture. We use Template Error Enhancement Factor (TEEF) to choose DSA material, determine grouping design rules, and select the optimum guiding patterns. Our post-pxOPC imaging data shows that it is promising to achieve 2-mask solution with DSA for the contact/via layer using 193i at 5nm node.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) is a well-known candidate for next generation sub-15nm half-pitch lithography. [1-2] DSA processes on 300mm wafers have been demonstrated for several years, and have given a strong impression due to finer pattern results. [3-4] On t he other hand, specific issues with DSA processes have begun to be clear as a result of these recent challenges. [5-6] Pattern placement error, which means the pattern shift after DSA fabrication, is recognized as one of these typical issues. Coat-Develop Track systems contribute to the DSA pattern fabrication and also influence the DSA pattern performance.[4] In this study, the placement error was investigated using a simple contact-hole pattern and subsequent contact-hole shrink process implemented on the SOKUDO DUO track. Thus, we will show the placement error of contact-hole shrink using a DSA process and discuss the difference between DSA and other shrink methods.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) has attracted significant interest as a patterning technique over the past few years. We have previously reported the development of a new process flow, the CHIPS flow (Chemo-epitaxy Induced by Pillar Structures), where we use ArFi lithography and plasma etch to print guiding pillar patterns for the DSA of cylindrical phase BCPs into dense hexagonal hole arrays of 22.5 nm half-pitch and 15 nm half-pitch [1]. The ability of this DSA process to generate dense regular patterns makes it an excellent candidate for patterning memory devices. Thus, in this paper we study the applicability of the CHIPS flow to patterning for DRAM storage layers. We report the impact of various process conditions on defect density, defect types and pattern variability. We also perform detailed analysis of the DSA patterns, quantify pattern placement accuracy and demonstrate a route towards excellent LCDU after pattern transfer into a hard mask layer.", "Several 27nm-pitch directed self-assembly (DSA) processes targeting fin formation for FinFET device fabrication are studied in a 300mm pilot line environment, including chemoepitaxy for a conventional Fin arrays, graphoepitaxy for a customization approach and a hybrid approach for self-aligned Fin cut. The trade-off between each DSA flow is discussed in terms of placement error, Fin CD/profile uniformity, and restricted design. Challenges in pattern transfer are observed and process optimization are discussed. Finally, silicon Fins with 100nm depth and on-target CD using different DSA options with either lithographic or self-aligned customization approach are demonstrated.", "In this paper, we focus on the directed-self-assembly (DSA) application for contact hole (CH) patterning using polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) block copolymers (BCPs). By employing the DSA planarization process, we highlight the DSA advantages for CH shrink, repair and multiplication which are extremely needed to push forward the limits of currently used lithography. Meanwhile, we overcome the issue of pattern densityrelated- defects that are encountered with the commonly-used graphoepitaxy process flow. Our study also aims to evaluate DSA performances as function of material properties and process conditions by monitoring main key manufacturing process parameters: CD uniformity (CDU), placement error (PE) and defectivity (Hole Open Yield = HOY). Concerning process, it is shown that the control of surface affinity and the optimization of self-assembly annealing conditions enable to significantly enhance CDU and PE. Regarding materials properties, we show that the best BCP composition for CH patterning should be set at 70/30 of PS/PMMA total weight ratio. Moreover, it is found that increasing the PS homopolymer content from 0.2% to 1% has no impact on DSA performances. Using a C35 BCP (cylinder-forming BCP of natural period L0 = 35nm), high DSA performances are achieved: CDU-3\u03c3 = 1.2nm, PE-3\u03c3 = 1.2nm and HOY = 100%. The stability of DSA process is also demonstrated through the process follow-up on both patterned and unpatterned surfaces over several weeks. Finally, simulation results, using a phase field model based on Ohta-Kawasaki energy functional are presented and discussed with regards to experiments.", "Directed self-assembly using block copolymers for positioning vertical interconnect access in integrated circuits relies on the proper shape of a confined domain in which polymers will self-assemble into the targeted design. Finding that shape, i.e., solving the inverse problem, is currently mainly based on trial and error approaches. We introduce a level-set based algorithm that makes use of a shape optimization strategy coupled with self-consistent field theory to solve the inverse problem in an automated way. It is shown that optimal shapes are found for different targeted topologies with accurate placement and distances between the different components.", "In this paper, we study the impact of topographic guide or template properties on pattern formation in a directed self-assembly (DSA) process. In particular, we investigate the relationship between free energy and defect generation or process robustness, and analyze the influence of guide affinity. The good correlation between experimental and simulation results confirms the role of certain setup parameters and process conditions on the DSA patterning.", "For Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) to be deployed in advanced semiconductor technologies, it must reliably integrate into a full process flow. We present a methodology for using virtual fabrication software, including predictive DSA process models, to develop and analyze the replacement of SAQP patterning with LiNe chemoepitaxy on a 14nm DRAM process. To quantify the impact of this module replacement, we investigate a key process yield metric for DRAM: interface area between the capacitor contacts and transistor source/drain. Additionally, we demonstrate virtual fabrication of the DRAM cell\u2019s hexagonally-packed capacitors patterned with an array of diblock copolymer cylinders in place of LE4 patterning.", "Developments of a Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) electrostatic Condenser Lens Array (CLA) for a Massively Parallel Electron Beam Direct Write (MPEBDW) lithography system are described. The CLA converges parallel electron beams for fine patterning. The structure of the CLA was designed on a basis of analysis by a finite element method (FEM) simulation. The lens was fabricated with precise machining and assembled with a nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) electron emitter array as an electron source of MPEBDW. The nc-Si electron emitter has the advantage that a vertical-emitted surface electron beam can be obtained without any extractor electrodes. FEM simulation of electron optics characteristics showed that the size of the electron beam emitted from the electron emitter was reduced to 15% by a radial direction, and the divergence angle is reduced to 1/18.", "The emerging Massively Parallel-Electron Beam Direct Write (MP-EBDW) is an attractive high resolution high throughput lithography technology. As previously shown, Chemically Amplified Resists (CARs) meet process/integration specifications in terms of dose-to-size, resolution, contrast, and energy latitude. However, they are still limited by their line width roughness. To overcome this issue, we tested an alternative advanced non-CAR and showed it brings a substantial gain in sensitivity compared to CAR. We also implemented and assessed in-line post-lithographic treatments for roughness mitigation. For outgassing-reduction purpose, a top-coat layer is added to the total process stack. A new generation top-coat was tested and showed improved printing performances compared to the previous product, especially avoiding dark erosion: SEM cross-section showed a straight pattern profile. A spin-coatable charge dissipation layer based on conductive polyaniline has also been tested for conductivity and lithographic performances, and compatibility experiments revealed that the underlying resist type has to be carefully chosen when using this product. Finally, the Process Of Reference (POR) trilayer stack defined for 5 kV multi-e-beam lithography was successfully etched with well opened and straight patterns, and no lithography-etch bias.", "Massively parallel mask-less electron beam lithography (MP-EBL) offers a large intrinsic flexibility at a low cost of ownership in comparison to conventional optical lithography tools. This attractive direct-write technique needs a dedicated data preparation flow to correct both electronic and resist processes. Moreover, Data Prep has to be completed in a short enough time to preserve the flexibility advantage of MP-EBL. While the MP-EBL tools have currently entered an advanced stage of development, this paper will focus on the data preparation side of the work for specifically the MAPPER Lithography FLX-1200 tool [1]-[4], using the ASELTA Nanographics Inscale software. The complete flow as well as the methodology used to achieve a full-field layout data preparation, within an acceptable cycle time, will be presented. Layout used for Data Prep evaluation was one of a 28 nm technology node Metal1 chip with a field size of 26x33mm2, compatible with typical stepper/scanner field sizes and wafer stepping plans. Proximity Effect Correction (PEC) was applied to the entire field, which was then exported as a single file to MAPPER Lithography\u2019s machine format, containing fractured shapes and dose assignments. The Soft Edge beam to beam stitching method was employed in the specific overlap regions defined by the machine format as well. In addition to PEC, verification of the correction was included as part of the overall data preparation cycle time. This verification step was executed on the machine file format to ensure pattern fidelity and accuracy as late in the flow as possible. Verification over the full chip, involving billions of evaluation points, is performed both at nominal conditions and at Process Window corners in order to ensure proper exposure and process latitude. The complete MP-EBL data preparation flow was demonstrated for a 28 nm node Metal1 layout in 37 hours. The final verification step shows that the Edge Placement Error (EPE) is kept below 2.25 nm over an exposure dose variation of 8%.", "As the integration node becomes smaller in 193nm ArF immersion optical lithography, the complexity of optical proximity correction (OPC) has been increased continuously. Moreover, pattern design should be changed by more aggressive transformation technique such as inverse lithography technique (ILT). The greater fidelity to the target design on wafers is achieved by the application of these OPC techniques and results in the greater complexity level of the mask patterns. Complicated mask pattern consists of many corners and assist features, which raises the fraction of small shots in e-beam data. To get more accurate mask pattern, the dose stability of small shots becomes more important in a complicated mask pattern. In this paper, we present the evaluation results of the small shot handling capabilities of e-beam machines. According to the results, the information of small shots generated during data fracturing should be considered as a factor that defines the complexity of patterns in e-beam writing. It shows that the small shot printing in e-beam machines need to be improved in order to guarantee mask pattern quality.", "This paper is about positioning error of photomask by resist charge up effect in the EB lithography. We postulated that charges created by incident electron beam in the photomask form electric dipoles perpendicular to its surface by the electron image effect from metal film. The formed electric dipole distributions depending on writing patterns deflect the orbit of the electron beam . We have simulated the deflection of the electron beam by the dipole produced at the surface and obtained the dipole distribution that led to the experimentally measured position error for a test writing pattern. Our model will be useful to predict the positioning error in EB lithography.", "Overlay errors, cut/block and line/space critical-dimension (CD) variations are the major sources of the edge-placement errors (EPE) in the cut/block patterning processes of complementary lithography when IC technology is scaled down to sub-10nm half pitch (HP). In this paper, we propose and discuss a modular technology to reduce the EPE effect by combining selective etching and alternating-material (dual-material) self-aligned multiple patterning (altSAMP) processes. Preliminary results of altSAMP process development and material screening experiment are reported and possible material candidates are suggested. A geometrical cut-process yield model considering the joint effect of overlay errors, cut-hole and line CD variations is developed to analyze its patterning performance. In addition to the contributions from the above three process variations, the impacts of key control parameters (such as cut-hole overhang and etching selectivity) on the patterning yield are examined. It is shown that the optimized altSAMP patterning process significantly improves the patterning yield compared with conventional SAMP processes, especially when the half pitch of device patterns is driven down to 7 nm and below.", "In this paper, we experimentally demonstrated a new technique of electric-field assisted assembly of core-shell particles to create uniform contact hole array with complex geometries. A spatially varying dielectrophoretic (DEP) force created by lithographically defined guiding features is used to control the particle position. The influence of the predefined guiding features on contact hole pattern displacement is systematically studied. The results show that the center-to-center spacing rather than the size and shape of the guiding features determines the particle placement, which indicates the self-healing potential of this technique.", "Tilted ion implantation (TII) is proposed as a lower-cost alternative to self-aligned double patterning (SADP) for pitch halving. This new approach is based on an enhancement in etch rate of a hard-mask layer by implant-induced damage. Ar+ implantation into a thin layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) is shown to enhance its etch rate in dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution, by up to 9\u00d7 for an implant dose of 3\u00d71014 cm-2. The formation of sub-lithographic features defined by masked tilted Ar+ implantation into a SiO2 hard-mask layer is experimentally demonstrated. Features with sizes as small as ~21 nm, self-aligned to the lithographically patterned mask, are achieved. As compared with SADP, enhanced patterning by TII requires far fewer and lower-cost process steps and hence is expected to be much more cost-effective.", "In this work, direct-write, high-resolution multiphoton photolithography using doped random methacrylic co-polymer thin films is demonstrated, using a continuous wave ultraviolet (UV) 375 nm diode laser source. The random copolymers are specifically designed for enhancing resolution and addressing issues arising from laser ablation processes, such as the berm-formation around the created holes in the film, which can be accessed by tuning the polymeric material properties including Tg, surface adhesion etc. The methacrylic copolymer is composed of monomers, each of them especially selected to improve individual properties. The material formulations comprise perylene molecules absorbing at the exposure wavelength where the polymeric matrix is transparent. It was found that if the radiation intensity exceeds a certain threshold, the perylene molecules transfer the absorbed light energy to the acrylate polymer matrix leading to polymer degradation and ablation of the exposed areas. The non-linear nature of the light absorption and energy transfer processes resulted in the creation of holes with critical dimensions well below the used wavelength reaching the sub 50 nm domain. Arrays of holes having various dimensions were fabricated in the laser ablation experiments using a directwrite laser system developed specifically for the purposes of this project.", "Microcolumns are widely used for parallel electron-beam lithography because of their compactness and the ability to achieve high spatial resolution. A design of an electrostatic microcolumn for our recent nanoscale photoemission sources is presented. We proposed a compact column structure (as short as several microns in length) for the ease of microcolumn fabrication and lithography operation. We numerically studied the influence of several design parameters on the optical performance such as microcolumn diameter, electrode thickness, beam current, working voltages, and working distance. We also examined the effect of fringing field between adjacent microcolumns during parallel lithography operations. The microcolumns were also fabricated to show the possibility.", "We demonstrate a novel approach for electron-beam lithography (EBL) of periodic nanostructures. This technique can rapidly produce arrays of various metallic and etched nanostructures with line and pitch dimensions approaching the beam spot size. Our approach is based on often neglected functionality which is inherent in most modern EBL systems. The raster/vector beam exposure system of the EBL software is exploited to produce arrays of pixel-like spots without the need to define coordinates for each spot in the array. Producing large arrays with traditional EBL techniques is cumbersome during pattern design, usually leads to large data files and easily results in system memory overload during patterning. In Dots-on-the-fly (DOTF) patterning, instead of specifying the locations of individual spots, a boundary for the array is given and the spacing between spots within the boundary is specified by the beam step size. A designed pattern element thus becomes a container object, with beam spacing acting as a parameterized location list for an array of spots confined by that container. With the DOTF method, a single pattern element, such as a square, rectangle or circle, can be used to produce a large array containing thousands of spots. In addition to simple arrays of nano-dots, we expand the technique to produce more complex, highly tunable arrays and structures on substrates of silicon, ITO/ FTO coated glass, as well as uncoated fused silica, quartz and sapphire.", "A novel nanoimprint lithography process using disposable biomass template having gas permeability was investigated. It was found that a disposable biomass template derived from cellulose materials shows an excellent gas permeability and decreases transcriptional defects in conventional templates such as quartz, PMDS, DLC that have no gas permeability. We believe that outgasses from imprinted materials are easily removed through the template. The approach to use a cellulose for template material is suitable as the next generation of clean separation technology. It is expected to be one of the defect-less thermal nanoimprint lithographic technologies. It is also expected that volatile materials and solvent including materials become available that often create defects and peelings in conventional temples that have no gas permeability.", "Nano-imprinting lithography (NIL) technology, as one of the most promising fabrication technologies, has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for large-area replication up to wafer-level, with features down to nanometer scale. The cost of resists used for NIL is important for wafer-level large-area replication. This study aims to develop capabilities in patterning larger area structure using thermal NIL. The commercial available Poly (Methyl Methacrylate) (PMMA) and Polystyrene (PS) polymers possess a variety of characteristics desirable for NIL, such as low material cost, low bulkvolumetric shrinkage, high spin coating thickness uniformity, high process stability, and acceptable dry-etch resistance. PMMA materials have been utilized for positive electron beam lithography for many years, offering high resolution capability and wide process latitude. In addition, it is preferable to have a negative resist like PMMA, which is a simple polymer with low cost and practically unlimited shelf life, and can be dissolved easily using commercial available Propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) safer solvent to give the preferred film thickness. PS is such a resist, as it undergoes crosslinking when exposed to deep UV light or an electron beam and can be used for NIL. The result is a cost effective patterning larger area structure using thermal nano-imprint lithography (NIL) by using commercial available PMMA and PS ploymers as NIL resists.", "Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) technology is in the spotlight as a next-generation semiconductor manufacturing technique for integrated circuits at 22 nm and beyond. NIL is the unmagnified lithography technique using template which is replicated from master templates. On the other hand, master templates are currently fabricated by electron-beam (EB) lithography[1]. In near future, finer patterns less than 15nm will be required on master template and EB data volume increases exponentially. So, we confront with a difficult challenge. A higher resolution EB mask writer and a high performance fabrication process will be required. In our previous study, we investigated a potential of photomask fabrication process for finer patterning and achieved 15.5nm line and space (L/S) pattern on template by using VSB (Variable Shaped Beam) type EB mask writer and chemically amplified resist. In contrast, we found that a contrast loss by backscattering decreases the performance of finer patterning. For semiconductor devices manufacturing, we must fabricate complicated patterns which includes high and low density simultaneously except for consecutive L/S pattern. Then it\u2019s quite important to develop a technique to make various size or coverage patterns all at once. In this study, a small feature pattern was experimentally formed on master template with dose modulation technique. This technique makes it possible to apply the appropriate exposure dose for each pattern size. As a result, we succeed to improve the performance of finer patterning in bright field area. These results show that the performance of current EB lithography process have a potential to fabricate NIL template.", "Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) technology is in the spotlight as a next-generation semiconductor manufacturing technique for integrated circuits at 22 nm and beyond.

Chemical shrink process is one of the most practical approaches to achieve small feature size CH (Contact Hole) or trench with ArF immersion lithography. We found that this shrink material has not only general benefits of shrink process like DOF (Depth of Focus) margin improvement, but also demonstrates a pattern smoothing effect through observation of the surface of shrink layer using SPM (Scanning Probe Microscope). Additionally, an improvement of LWR (Line Width Roughness) over 16% and an improvement of LCDU (Local Critical Dimension Uniformity) around 60% were observed.", "Electric field can induce long range flow in liquid materials. This phenomenon is known as liquid electromigration. In particular case of Cr thin film deposited on an insulating substrate, application of high electric-field between two point electrodes results in liquefaction and subsequent flow of the liquefied material in a radially symmetric fashion away from the cathode. This electric field driven material transport phenomenon has been used for a new patterning technique, named electrolithography. A negatively biased scanning probe is used to etch a thin Cr film according to a desired pattern. Then the pattern is transferred to new materials using a polymer layer below the metal film. Electrolithography does not need any UV or e-beam source, and can be performed in ambient condition. We have achieved pattern resolutions of 9 nm on the polymer and 40 nm on transferring the pattern to other materials. In this work, with the help of electrolithography, we have patterned large areas using vector scan technique. This improves throughput of the process by a significant order.", "Pixelated wiregrids are of great interest in polarimetric imagers, but there are no straightforward methods available for combining the uniform exposures of laser interference with a masking system to achieve pixels at different rotational angles. In this work we demonstrate a 266nm deep-UV interference lithography combined with a traditional i-line contact lithography to create such pixels. Aluminum wiregrids are first made, following by etching to create the pixels, and then a planarizing molybdenum film is used before patterning subsequent pixel arrays. The etch contrast between the molybdenum and the aluminum enables the release of the planarizing layer.", "In this study, we investigated a directed self-assembly (DSA) flow that could include a non-periodic pattern (i.e., wide line) lying in between the periodic line/space patterns, in a relatively simple and inexpensive way. A symmetric poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) with the natural periodicity (L0) of 30 nm was employed here. Our DSA flow has two key features. First, we used a hybrid approach that combined chemoepitaxy and graphoepitaxy methods to generate PMMA-attractive pinning guide patterns directly from ArF resist. Second, we attempted to utilize both the perpendicular lamellae in the periodic regions and the horizontal lamellae on the non-periodic pattern as an etch template. The advantage of this process will be a reduction of the number of lithographic processes, whereas the challenge is how to control the mixed morphologies at the boundary between the periodic and non-periodic regions. Our preliminary results from simulations and experiments showed that, in order to generate the horizontal lamellae on the non-periodic pattern, the PS-b-PMMA thickness on top of the non-periodic guide pattern should roughly match to ~1 L0, and the width of the non-periodic pattern should be larger than ~3-4 L0. In addition, the space between the periodic and non-periodic regions was found to be critical and it should be basically equal to the space between the guiding pins in the periodic regions (~75 nm) to minimize the formation of fingerprint morphology at the boundaries.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) with conventional lithography is being thought as one of the potential patterning solution for future generation devices manufacturing. New BCP platform is required to obtain resolution below 10nm half pitch (HP), better roughness, and defect characteristics than PS-b-PMMA. In this study, we will introduce the newly developed Si-containing high chi BCP which can apply perpendicular lamellar orientation with topcoat free, mild thermal annealing under nitrogen process conditions. It will be also shown in experimental results of graphoepitaxy demonstration for L/S multiplication using new high chi BCP.", "Placement of cylinders in hole multiplication patterns for directed self-assembly is the topic of this computational study. A hole doublet process applying a corner rounded rectangle guide is the focus of this work. Placements including morphology fluctuation can be analyzed by dissipative particle dynamics simulation. When the surface of guides and underlayers are modified from strong polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) attractive to weak PMMA attractive, two PMMA cylinders can be contacted at the underlayer. Even when the PMMA domain had a separated morphology, hole placement errors (HPE) were similar to those with connected domains which occurred in the strong PMMA affine case. In general, HPE in longitudinal guide direction was larger than in the shorter direction. It is interesting to note that HPE in the longer direction was decreased by increasing the guide size in shorter direction. Cylinder tops likely fluctuate; cylinder middles may fluctuate as well in some cases. Means for HPE reduction were also tested computationally: reducing the guide thickness and employing dimpled structures. Decreasing guide thickness was effective for reducing HPE; however, guide thicknesses that were too thin prevented PMMA domains from forming vertical cylinders. Dimpled structures also reduced HPE. The depth of the dimple had a little influence on the distance of two holes when the guide structure was fitted with hexagonal packing for the block co-polymers.", "Si-rich poly((polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) methacrylate)-b-poly(trifluoroethyl methacrylate) (PMAPOSS-b- PTFEMA) was used to form 8-nm half-pitch line and space (L/S) pattern via grapho-epitaxy. Vertical alignment of the lamellae was achieved without using either a neutral layer or top-coating material. Because PMAPOSS-b-PTFEMA forms vertical lamellae on a variety of substrates, we used two types of physical guide structures for grapho-epitaxy; one was a substrate guide and the other was a guide with an embedded under layer. On the substrate guide structure, a fine L/S pattern was obtained with trench widths equal to 3\u20137 periods of the lamella spacing of the block copolymer, Lo. However, on the embedded under layer guide structure, L/S pattern was observed only with 3 Lo and 4 Lo in trench width. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscope images revealed that a thick PMAPOSS layer was formed under the PMAPOSS-b-PTFEMA L/S pattern. Pattern transfer of the PMAPOSS-b-PTFEMA L/S pattern was prevented by a thick PMAPOSS layer. To achieve pattern transfer to the under layer, optimization of the surface properties is necessary.", "Our target at EIDEC is to study the feasibility of directed self-assembly (DSA) technology for semiconductor device manufacturing through electrical yield verification by development of such as process, material, metrology, simulation and design for DSA. We previously developed a grapho/chemo-hybrid coordinated line epitaxial process for sub-15-nm line-and-space (L/S) patterning using polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) lamellar block copolymers (BCPs)1\u2013 3. Electrical yield verification results showed that a 30% open yield was successfully achieved with a metal wire line length of 700 \u03bcm 4. In the next stage of the evaluation, a sub-10-nm L/S DSA patterning process based on graphoepitaxial DSA of 20-nm lamellar period organic BCPs was developed based on neutral layer and guide space width optimization. At a 30-nm guide height, problems such as BCP overflow and DSA line shorts were observed after the dry development. At a 60-nm guide height, grid-like short defects were observed under dry development shallow etch conditions and sub-10-nm L/S patterns were formed under optimized etch conditions with a suitable BCP film thickness margin. The process performance was evaluated in terms of defects and critical dimension measurements using an electron beam inspection system and critical dimension-scanning electron microscope metrology. The main DSA defects were short defects, and the spatial roughness appeared to be caused by the periodic pitches of these short defects and the guide roughness. We successfully demonstrated the fabrication of sub-10-nm metal wires consists of L/S, pad, connect and cut patterns with controlled alignment and stack structure through lithography, etching and CMP process on a 300- mm wafer using the fully integrated DSA process and damascene processing.", "In recent years major advancements have been made in the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP). DSA is now widely regarded as a leading complementary patterning technique for future node integrated circuit (IC) device manufacturing and is considered for the 7 nm node. One of the most straightforward approaches for implementation of DSA is via patterning by graphoepitaxy. In this approach, the guiding pattern dictates the location and pitch of the resulting hole structures while the material properties of the BCP control the feature size and uniformity. Tight pitches need to be available for a successful implementation of DSA for future node via patterning which requires DSA in small guiding pattern CDs. Here, we show strategies how to enable the desired CD shrink in these small guiding pattern vias by utilizing high \u03c7 block copolymers and/or controlling the surface properties of the template, i.e. sidewall and bottom affinity to the blocks.", "Block copolymers, polymers composed of two or more homopolymers covalently bonded together, are currently being investigated as a method to extend optical lithography due to their ability to microphase separate on small size scales. In order to drive down the size that these BCPs phase separate, the BCPs with larger Flory-Huggin's \u03c7parameter needs to be found. Typically these BCPs are composed of more dissimilar homopolymers. However, changing these interactions also changes how BCPs interact with their guiding underlayers. In this paper, several block copolymers are simulated annealing on chemoepitaxial guiding underlayers using a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model in order to explore the effect that either energetic asymmetry or density asymmetry in the BCP have on the pattern registration. It is found that energetic asymmetry in BCPs causes one of the blocks to desire to skin, which shifts the composition of the background region that leads to well aligned vertical lamellae formation. It is hypothesized that moderate footing and undercutting at the underlayer or slight skinning at the free surface can increase the kinetics of defect annihilation by decreasing the distance that bridges must form. The density asymmetric BCPs simulated in this paper have different mechanical properties which lead to straighter sidewalls in the BCP film and potentially lead to better pattern registration. It is hypothesized that altering the compressibility of the blocks can alter equilibrium defectivity.", "In this work, we present completely industry adapted processes for high-chi PS-PDMS block copolymers. DSA was performed on trenches fabricated within standard photolithography stacks and pattern transfer was made by using etching processes similar to those used for gate etching in industry. We propose the alignment of two different PS-PDMS (45.5kg/mol, 16kg/mol) solely by thermal annealing. By adding plasticizer molecules in the high molecular weight BCP (45.5k), we have not only avoided solvent vapor annealing but also reduced significantly the processing time. The properties of the guiding lines and the quality of the final BCP hard mask (CD uniformity, LWR, LER) were investigated.", "This manuscript first presents a cost model to compare the cost of ownership of DSA and SAQP for a typical front end of line (FEoL) line patterning exercise. Then, we proceed to a feasibility study of using a vertical furnace to batch anneal the block co-polymer for DSA applications. We show that the defect performance of such a batch anneal process is comparable to the process of record anneal methods. This helps in increasing the cost benefit for DSA compared to the conventional multiple patterning approaches.", "The methodology suggested in this research provides the great possibility of creating nanostructures composed of various materials, such as soft polymer, hard polymer, and metal, as well as Si. Such nanostructures are required for a vast range of optical and display devices, photonic components, physical devices, energy devices including electrodes of secondary batteries, fuel cells, solar cells, and energy harvesters, biological devices including biochips, biomimetic or biosimilar structured devices, and mechanical devices including micro- or nano-scale sensors and actuators.", "A rigorous electromagnetic simulation method for grating diffraction is presented that concurrently enables appropriate roughness and irregularity modeling. The approach will it make possible for example to overlay surface roughness and or line edge roughness (LER) to regular patterns. In this way, a unique tool is provided to model diffraction and scattering at the same time. It is based on a combination of modal methods such as the RCWA or C-method with near field stitching and subsequent near-to-far field propagation. This paves the way to an efficient and accurate modeling of large scattering areas. Fields of applications are the design of spectrographic gratings as well as optical scatterometry or kindred optical metrology techniques. Examples are provided both for 2D line/space patterns with sinusoidal and blaze profiles and 3D line/space patterns possessing LER and line width roughness (LWR). First ideas are derived how to determine LER and LWR from scatterometric measurements.", "Using rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) and finite element method (FEM) simulations together, many interesting ellipsometric measurements can be investigated. This work specifically focuses on simulating copper grating structures that are plasmonically active. Looking at near-field images and Mueller matrix spectra, understanding of physical phenomena is possible. A general strategy for combatting convergence difficulties in RCWA simulations is proposed and applied. The example used is a copper cross-grating structure with known slow convergence.", "In recent technology nodes, advanced process and novel integration scheme have challenged the precision limits of conventional metrology; with critical dimensions (CD) of device reduce to sub-nanometer region. Optical metrology has proved its capability to precisely detect intricate details on the complex structures, however, conventional RCWA-based (rigorous coupled wave analysis) scatterometry has the limitations of long time-to-results and lack of flexibility to adapt to wide process variations. Signal Response Metrology (SRM) is a new metrology technique targeted to alleviate the consumption of engineering and computation resources by eliminating geometric/dispersion modeling and spectral simulation from the workflow. This is achieved by directly correlating the spectra acquired from a set of wafers with known process variations encoded. In SPIE 2015, we presented the results of SRM application in lithography metrology and control [1], accomplished the mission of setting up a new measurement recipe of focus/dose monitoring in hours. This work will demonstrate our recent field exploration of SRM implementation in 20nm technology and beyond, including focus metrology for scanner control; post etch geometric profile measurement, and actual device profile metrology.", "In this work, capabilities of scatterometry at various steps of the self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) process flow for 7nm (N7) technology node are demonstrated including the pitch walk measurement on the final fin etch step. The scatterometry solutions for each step are verified using reference metrology and the capability to follow the planned process design-of-experiment (DOE) and the sensitivity to catch the small process variations are demonstrated. Pitch walk, which is pitch variation in the four line/space (L/S) populations, is one of the main process challenges for SAQP. Scatterometry, which is a versatile optical technique for critical dimensions (CD) and shape metrology, can find the direct measurement of pitch walk challenging because it is a very weak parameter. In this work, the pitch walk measurement is managed via scatterometry using an advanced technique of parallel interpretation of scatterometry pads with varying pitches. The three populations of trenches could be clearly distinguished with the scatterometry and the consistency with the reference data and with the process DOE are presented. In addition, the root cause of the within-wafer non-uniformity of fin CD is determined. The measurements were done on-site at IMEC as a part of the process development and control of the IMEC SAQP processes [1]. All in all, in this work it is demonstrated that scatterometry is capable of monitoring each process step of FEOL SAQP and it can measure three different space populations separately and extract pitch walk information at the final fin etch step.", "We demonstrate hyperspectral coherent imaging in the EUV spectral region for the first time, without the need for hardware-based wavelength separation. This new scheme of spectromicroscopy is the most efficient use of EUV photons for imaging because there is no energy loss from mirrors or monochromatizing optics. An EUV spectral comb from a tabletop high-harmonic source, centered at a wavelength of 30nm, illuminates the sample and the scattered light is collected on a pixel-array detector. Using a lensless imaging technique known as ptychographical information multiplexing, we simultaneously retrieve images of the spectral response of the sample at each individual harmonic. We show that the retrieved spectral amplitude and phase agrees with theoretical predictions. This work demonstrates the power of coherent EUV beams for rapid material identification with nanometer-scale resolution.", "The combination of scanning electron microscopy for high spatial resolution, images from multiple angles to provide 3D information, and commercially available stereo photogrammetry software for 3D reconstruction offers promise for nanometer-scale dimensional metrology in 3D. A method is described to test 3D photogrammetry software by the use of virtual samples\u2014mathematical samples from which simulated images are made for use as inputs to the software under test. The virtual sample is constructed by wrapping a rough skin with any desired power spectral density around a smooth near-trapezoidal line with rounded top corners. Reconstruction is performed with images simulated from different angular viewpoints. The software\u2019s reconstructed 3D model is then compared to the known geometry of the virtual sample. Three commercial photogrammetry software packages were tested. Two of them produced results for line height and width that were within close to 1 nm of the correct values. All of the packages exhibited some difficulty in reconstructing details of the surface roughness.", "Critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) metrology has long used empirical approaches to determine edge locations. While such solutions are very flexible, physics-based models offer the potential for improved accuracy and precision for specific applications. Here, Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate theoretical linescans from single step and line/space targets in order to build a physics-based analytical model, including the presence of bottom footing and top corner rounding. The resulting analytical linescan model fits the Monte Carlo simulation results for different feature heights, widths, pitches, sidewall angles, bottom footing, and top corner rounding. This model has also been successfully applied to asymetric features such as sidewall spacers encountered in self-aligned double patterning.", "Computer simulation of lithographic performance, including resist CD, film thickness, sidewall angle and profile has been extensively studied during the past three decades. Lithography simulation has been widely adopted as an enabling technology for high-volume chip manufacturing. However, measurement artifacts arising from CD-SEM metrology are typically ignored in simulation, due to the difficulty of accurately modeling the effect of the CD-SEM at acceptable computational speed. In this paper, we demonstrate how CD measurements can be improved by including a fast, compact CD-SEM model. For example, the variation in effective resist metrology height along contour lines extracted from a simulated CD-SEM image is characterized for a range of structures through focus. We also demonstrate how SEM settings affect the shape of extracted SEM contour and metrology height at contour edge. The Edge Placement Error (EPE) caused by SEM artifact is carefully studied.", "The electric field distribution and charging effects in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were studied by extending a Monte-Carlo based SEM simulator by a fast and accurate multigrid (MG) based 3D electric field solver. The main focus is on enabling short simulation times with maintaining sufficient accuracy, so that SEM simulation can be used in practical applications. The implementation demonstrates a gain in computation speed, when compared to a Gauss-Seidel based reference solver is roughly factor of 40, with negligible differences in the result (~10\u22126 \ud835\udc49). In addition, the simulations were compared with experimental SEM measurements using also complex 3D sample, showing that i) the modelling of e-fields improves the simulation accuracy, and ii) multigrid method provide a significant benefit in terms of simulation time.", "In this work we address the computation times of numerical studies in dimensional metrology. In particular, full Monte-Carlo simulation programs for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image acquisition are known to be notoriously slow. Our quest in reducing the computation time of SEM image simulation has led us to investigate the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) for metrology. We have succeeded in creating a full Monte-Carlo simulation program for SEM images, which runs entirely on a GPU. The physical scattering models of this GPU simulator are identical to a previous CPU-based simulator, which includes the dielectric function model for inelastic scattering and also refinements for low-voltage SEM applications. As a case study for the performance, we considered the simulated exposure of a complex feature: an isolated silicon line with rough sidewalls located on a at silicon substrate. The surface of the rough feature is decomposed into 408 012 triangles. We have used an exposure dose of 6 mC/cm2, which corresponds to 6 553 600 primary electrons on average (Poisson distributed). We repeat the simulation for various primary electron energies, 300 eV, 500 eV, 800 eV, 1 keV, 3 keV and 5 keV. At first we run the simulation on a GeForce GTX480 from NVIDIA. The very same simulation is duplicated on our CPU-based program, for which we have used an Intel Xeon X5650. Apart from statistics in the simulation, no difference is found between the CPU and GPU simulated results. The GTX480 generates the images (depending on the primary electron energy) 350 to 425 times faster than a single threaded Intel X5650 CPU. Although this is a tremendous speedup, we actually have not reached the maximum throughput because of the limited amount of available memory on the GTX480. Nevertheless, the speedup enables the fast acquisition of simulated SEM images for metrology. We now have the potential to investigate case studies in CD-SEM metrology, which otherwise would take unreasonable amounts of computation time.", "This paper will provide a high level overview of the future for in-line high volume manufacturing (HVM) metrology for the semiconductor industry. First, we will take a broad view of the needs of patterned defect, critical dimensional (CD/3D) and films metrology, and present the extensive list of applications for which metrology solutions are needed. Commonalities and differences among the various applications will be shown. We will then report on the gating technical limits of the most important of these metrology solutions to address the metrology challenges of future nodes, highlighting key metrology technology gaps requiring industry attention and investment.", "We present an extension to ptychography that allows simultaneous deconvolution of multiple, spatially separate, illuminating probes. This enables an increased field of view and hence, an increase in imaging throughput, without increased exposure times. This technique can be used for any non-interfering probes: demonstrated with multiple wavelengths and orthogonal polarizations. The latter of which gives us spatially resolved polarization spectroscopy from a single scan.", "We propose a measurement technique which enables the precise determination of side wall angles (SWAs) with absolute values below 1\u00b0. Our simulations show that a differentiation between asymmetric SWAs is also possible. The grating structure under investigation has a grating period on the order of a few micrometers. Each grating line consists of a fine sub-grating with 40 nm period and 20 nm critical dimension. Our approach is based on coherent high-NA Fourier scatterometry, extended by a lateral scan over the sample. Additionally, a 180\u00b0-shearing element allows for coherent superposition of the higher diffraction orders.", "Optical near-field technologies such as solid immersion lenses and hyperlenses are candidate solutions for high resolution and high throughput wafer inspection and metrology for the next technology nodes. Besides sub-diffraction limited optical performance, these concepts share the necessity of extreme proximity to the sample at distances that are measured in tens of nanometers. For the instrument this poses two major challenges: 1) how to measure the distance to the sample? and 2) how to position accurately and at high speed? For the first challenge near-field thermal radiation is proposed as a mechanism for an integrated distance sensor (patent pending). This sensor is realized by making a sensitive calorimeter (accuracy of 2:31nW root sum squared). When used for distance measurement an equivalent uncertainty of 1nm can be achieved for distances smaller than 100 nm. By scanning the distance sensor over the sample, thermal profilometry is realized, which can be used to inspect surfaces in a non-intrusive and non-contact way. This reduces wear of the probe and minimizes the likelihood of damaging the sample.", "Coherent extreme ultraviolet beams from tabletop high harmonic generation offer revolutionary capabilities for observing nanoscale systems on their intrinsic length and time scales. By launching and monitoring acoustic waves in such systems, we fully characterize sub-10nm films and find that the Poisson\u2019s ratio of low-k dielectric materials does not stay constant as often assumed, but increases when bond coordination is bellow a critical value. Within the same measurement, by following the heat dissipation dynamics from nano-gratings of width 20-1000nm and different periodicities, we confirm the effects of the newly identified collectively-diffusive regime, where close-spaced nanowires cool faster than widely-spaced ones.", "We use EUV coherent microscopy to obtain high-resolution images of buried interfaces, with chemical specificity, in 2+1 dimensions. We perform reflection mode, ptychographic, coherent diffractive imaging with tabletop EUV light, at 29nm, produced by high harmonic generation. Our damascene-style samples consist of copper structures inlaid in SiO2, polished nearly flat with chemical mechanical polishing. We obtain images of both an unaltered damascene as well as one buried below a 100nm thick layer of evaporated aluminum. The aluminum is opaque to visible light and thick enough that neither optical microscopy, SEM, nor AFM can access the buried interface. EUV microscopy is able to image the buried structures, non-destructively, in conditions where other techniques cannot.", "Critical dimension small-angle x-ray scattering (CD-SAXS) with a grazing-incidence geometry, which was recently developed by the authors, has been successfully applied to the cross-sectional profile measurements of different types of L/S- and hole-type patterns on photoresist surfaces. We have calculated diffraction intensities from the nanostructures based on a distorted wave Born approximation method to take the refraction and the reflection at the interfaces between layers into account, and the average cross-sectional profiles have been analyzed by a model-based least-square method. From the precise analyses, slight cross-sectional profile differences of a few nanometers scale generated by using different material and exposure conditions have been identified. The obtained cross-sectional profiles showed good agreements with the results obtained by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These results demonstrate the applicability of the CD-SAXS to the nanoscale structural metrology. It is expected that the CD-SAXS is also applicable to even smaller scale structures, e.g., those of EUV, NIL, or DSA, as the x-ray wavelength is well shorter than the critical lengths of these structures.", "Complexity of process steps integration and material systems for next-generation technology nodes is reaching unprecedented levels, the appetite for higher sampling rates is on the rise, while the process window continues to shrink. Current thickness metrology specifications reach as low as 0.1A for total error budget \u2013 breathing new life into an old paradigm with lower visibility for past few metrology nodes: accuracy. Furthermore, for advance nodes there is growing demand to measure film thickness and composition on devices/product instead of surrogate planar simpler pads. Here we extend our earlier work in Hybrid Metrology to the combination of X-Ray based reference technologies (high performance) with optical high volume manufacturing (HVM) workhorse metrology (high throughput). Our stated goal is: put more \u201ceyes\u201d on the wafer (higher sampling) and enable move to films on pattern structure (control what matters). Examples of 1X front-end applications are used to setup and validate the benefits.", "Planar fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology potentially offers comparable transistor performance as FinFETs. pFET FDOSI devices are based on a silicon germanium (cSiGe) layer on top of a buried oxide (BOX). Ndoped interfacial layer (IL), high-k (HfO2) layer and the metal gate stacks are then successively built on top of the SiGe layer. In-line metrology is critical in precisely monitoring the thickness and composition of the gate stack and associated underlying layers in order to achieve desired process control. However, any single in-line metrology technique is insufficient to obtain the thickness of IL, high-k, cSiGe layers in addition to Ge% and N-dose in one single measurement. A hybrid approach is therefore needed that combines the capabilities of more than one measurement technique to extract multiple parameters in a given film stack. This paper will discuss the approaches, challenges, and results associated with the first-in-industry implementation of XPS-XRF hybrid metrology for simultaneous detection of high-k thickness, IL thickness, N-dose, cSiGe thickness and %Ge, all in one signal measurement on a FDSOI substrate in a manufacturing fab. Strong correlation to electrical data for one or more of these measured parameters will also be presented, establishing the reliability of this technique.", "With the continuous shrink of design rules from 14nm to 10nm to 7nm, conserving process windows in a high volume manufacturing environment is becoming more and more difficult. Masks, scanners, and etch processes have to meet very tight specifications in order to keep defect, CD, as well as overlay within the margins of the process window. In this work, we study a design-based e-beam defect inspection technology for wafer level process window characterization and intra-field defect variability on 10nm logic devices. Due to high resolution, e-beam technology is the natural choice for review and/or detection of subtle pattern deviations, aka defects. The capability of integrating design information (GDS file) with defect detection, dimension measurement of critical structure, and defect classification provides added values for engineers to identify yield limiting systematic defects and to provide feedback to design.", "By 2017, the critical dimension in patterned wafers will shrink down to 7 nm, which brings great challenges to optics-based defect inspection techniques, due to the ever-decreasing signal to noise ratio with respect to defect size. To continue pushing forward the optics-based metrology technique, it is of great importance to analyze the full characteristics of the scattering field of a wafer with a defect and then to find the most sensitive signal type. In this article, the vector boundary element method is firstly introduced to calculate the scattering field of a patterned wafer at a specific objective plane, after which a vector imaging theory is introduced to calculate the field at an image plane for an imaging system with a high numerical aperture objective lens. The above methods enable the effective modeling of the image for an arbitrary vectorial scattering electromagnetic field coming from the defect pattern of the wafer.", "For sub-2Xnm technology nodes, metallic buried voids in metal contacts have become critical yield and reliability issue for high volume semiconductor device manufacturing. Especially as the scaling continues, void-free metal filling becomes more challenging for advanced technology development, which poses great need for effective in-line detection methodology. In this paper we demonstrate comprehensive study of a special buried metallic void detection mode by backscatter electron (BSE) signals based on effective density contrast (EDC), especially for the case of partial conduction while the conventional voltage contrast (VC) mode has no detection due to minimum detectable resistance difference requirement. Successful application of EDC mode in buried metallic void detection by in-line electron beam inspection (EBI) is presented on various metal contact chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) layers, together with Monte Carlo simulations and other characterization methodology which show consistent correlation with experimental observations. Thus an extrapolation based on simulation result is illustrated to predict the detection capability of EDC mode in buried metallic void detection for the popular metal contact material systems including tungsten and copper. Despite of the detection limitation as well as potential damage by the charged particle exposure, EDC mode is demonstrated as a very effective detection methodology for buried metallic void in advanced technology development.", "Innovations in nanotechnology are empowering scientists to deepen their understanding of physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. Powerful and precise characterization systems are essential to meet researchers\u2019 requirements. SEEC (Surface Enhanced Ellipsometric Contrast) microscopy is an innovative advanced optical technique based on ellipsometric and interference fringes of Fizeau principles. This technique offers live and label-free topographic imaging of organic, inorganic and biological samples with high Z resolution (down to 0.1nm thickness), and enhanced X-Y detection limit (down to 1.5nm width). This technique has been successfully applied to the study of nanometric films and structures, biological layers, and nano-objects. We applied SEEC technology to different applications explored below.", "With decreasing CDOF (Critical Depth Of Focus) for 20/14nm technology and beyond, focus errors are becoming increasingly critical for on-product performance. Current on product focus control techniques in high volume manufacturing are limited; It is difficult to define measurable focus error and optimize focus response on product with existing methods due to lack of credible focus measurement methodologies. Next to developments in imaging and focus control capability of scanners and general tool stability maintenance, on-product focus control improvements are also required to meet on-product imaging specifications. In this paper, we discuss focus monitoring, wafer (edge) fingerprint correction and on-product focus budget analysis through diffraction based focus (DBF) measurement methodology. Several examples will be presented showing better focus response and control on product wafers. Also, a method will be discussed for a focus interlock automation system on product for a high volume manufacturing (HVM) environment.", "To further shrink the contact and trench dimensions, Negative Tone Development (NTD) has become the de facto process at these layers. The NTD process uses a positive tone resist and an organic solvent-based negative tone developer which leads to improved image contrast, larger process window and smaller Mask Error Enhancement Factor (MEEF)[1]. The NTD masks have high transmission values leading to lens heating and as observed here wafer heating as well. Both lens and wafer heating will contribute to overlay error, however the effects of lens heating can be mitigated by applying lens heating corrections while no such corrections exist for wafer heating yet. Although the magnitude of overlay error due to wafer heating is low relative to lens heating; ever tightening overlay requirements imply that the distortions due to wafer heating will quickly become a significant part of the overlay budget. In this work the effects, analysis and observations of wafer heating on contact and metal layers of the 14nm node are presented. On product wafers it manifests as a difference in the scan up and scan down signatures between layers. An experiment to further understand wafer heating is performed with a test reticle that is used to monitor scanner performance.", "Line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) are analyzed during pattern transfer in a self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) process. This patterning process leads to a final pitch of 22.5nm, relevant for N7/N5 technologies. Measurements performed by CD SEM (Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope) using different settings in terms of averaging, field of view, and pixel size are compared with reference metrology performed by planar TEM and three-Dimensional Atomic Force Microscope (3D AFM) for each patterning process step in order to investigate the optimal condition for an in-line LWR characterization. Pattern wiggling is als0 quantitatively analyzed during LER/LWR transfer in the SAQP process.", "Process-window (PW) evaluation is critical to assess the lithography process quality and limitations. Usual CD-based PW gives only a partial answer. Simulations such as Tachyon LMC (Lithography Manufacturability Check) can efficiently overcome this limitation by analyzing the entire predicted resist contours. But so far experimental measurements did not allow such flexibility. This paper shows an innovative experimental flow, which allows the user to directly validate LMC results across PW for a select group of reference patterns, thereby overcoming the limitations found in the traditional CD-based PW analysis. To evaluate the process window on wafer more accurately, we take advantage of design based metrology and extract experimental contours from the CD-SEM measurements. Then we implement an area metric to quantify the area coverage of the experimental contours with respect to the intended ones, using a defined \u201csectorization\u201d for the logic structures. This \u2018sectorization\u2019 aims to differentiate specific areas on the logic structures being analyzed, such as corners, line-ends, short and long lines. This way, a complete evaluation of the information contained in each CD-SEM picture is performed, without having to discard any information. This solution doesn\u2019t look at the area coverage of an entire feature, but uses a \u2018sectorization\u2019 to differentiate specific feature areas such as corners, line-ends, short and long lines, and thus look at those area coverages. An assessment of resist model/OPC quality/process quality at sub nm-level accuracy is rendered possible.", "The merits of a robust Statistical Process Control (SPC) methodology have long been established. In response to the numerous SPC rule combinations, processes, and the high cost of containment, the Instability Index (ISTAB) is presented as a tool for managing these complexities. ISTAB focuses limited resources on key issues and provides a window into the stability of manufacturing operations.\nISTAB takes advantage of the statistical nature of processes by comparing the observed average run length (OARL) to the expected run length (ARL), resulting in a gap value called the ISTAB index. The ISTAB index has three characteristic behaviors that are indicative of defects in an SPC instance.\nCase 1: The observed average run length is excessively long relative to expectation. ISTAB > 0 is indicating the possibility that the limits are too wide.\nCase 2: The observed average run length is consistent with expectation. ISTAB near zero is indicating that the process is stable.\nCase 3: The observed average run length is inordinately short relative to expectation. ISTAB < 0 is indicating that the limits are too tight, the process is unstable or both.\nThe probability distribution of run length is the basis for establishing an ARL. We demonstrate that the geometric distribution is a good approximation to run length across a wide variety of rule sets. Excessively long run lengths are associated with one kind of defect in an SPC instance; inordinately short run lengths are associated with another. A sampling distribution is introduced as a way to quantify excessively long and inordinately short observed run lengths. This paper provides detailed guidance for action limits on these run lengths. ISTAB as a statistical method of review facilitates automated instability detection.\nThis paper proposes a management system based on ISTAB as an enhancement to more traditional SPC approaches.", "Dimensional scaling trends will eventually bring semiconductor critical dimensions (CDs) down to only a few atoms in width. New optical techniques are required to address the measurement and variability for these CDs using sufficiently small in-die metrology targets. Recently, Qin et al. [Light Sci Appl, 5, e16038 (2016)] demonstrated quantitative modelbased measurements of finite sets of lines with features as small as 16 nm using 450 nm wavelength light. This paper uses simulation studies, augmented with experiments at 193 nm wavelength, to adapt and optimize the finite sets of features that work as in-die-capable metrology targets with minimal increases in parametric uncertainty. A finite element based solver for time-harmonic Maxwell\u2019s equations yields two- and three-dimensional simulations of the electromagnetic scattering for optimizing the design of such targets as functions of reduced line lengths, fewer number of lines, fewer focal positions, smaller critical dimensions, and shorter illumination wavelength. Metrology targets that exceeded performance requirements are as short as 3 \u03bcm for 193 nm light, feature as few as eight lines, and are extensible to sub-10 nm CDs. Target areas measured at 193 nm can be fifteen times smaller in area than current state-of-the-art scatterometry targets described in the literature. This new methodology is demonstrated to be a promising alternative for optical model-based in-die CD metrology.", "Controlling thickness and composition of gate stack layers in logic and memory devices is critical to ensure transistor performance meets requirements, especially at 10nm node due to the 3-d geometry of devices and tight process budget. It has become necessary to measure and control each layer in the gate stack before and after dielectric and metal gate deposition sequences. A typical gate stack can have 5-7 layers including the interfacial layer, high-k dielectric, metal gate stack, work function layers, and cap layers. Similarly, PMOS channel strain is controlled using a graded SixGe1-x stack grown epitaxially over fins in the source/drain regions. This graded stack can have 2-4 layers of different thicknesses and Ge concentrations. This paper discusses the benefit of using spectroscopic ellipsometry with multiple angles of incidence to accurately and precisely determine the thickness of individual layers in critical gate layer stacks at various process steps on planar and grating surfaces. We will also show the benefit of using an advanced laser-based ellipsometer, for ultra-precise measurement of the gate interfacial layer oxides.", "Gate-all-around (GAA) nanowire (NW) devices have long been acknowledged as the ultimate device from an electrostatic scaling point of view. The GAA architecture offers improved short channel effect (SCE) immunity compared to single and double gate planar, FinFET, and trigate structures. One attractive proposal for making GAA devices involves the use of a multilayer fin-like structure consisting of layers of Si and SiGe. However, such structures pose various metrology challenges, both geometrical and material. Optical Scatterometry, also called optical critical dimension (OCD) is a fast, accurate and non-destructive in-line metrology technique well suited for GAA integration challenges. In this work, OCD is used as an enabler for the process development of nanowire devices, extending its abilities to learn new material and process aspects specific to this novel device integration. The specific metrology challenges from multiple key steps in the process flow are detailed, along with the corresponding OCD solutions and results. In addition, Low Energy X-Ray Fluorescence (LE-XRF) is applied to process steps before and after the removal of the SiGe layers in order to quantify the amount of Ge present at each step. These results are correlated to OCD measurements of the Ge content, demonstrating that both OCD and LE-XRF are sensitive to Ge content for these applications.", "Through-focus scanning optical microscopy (TSOM) shows promise for patterned defect analysis, but it is important to minimize total system noise. TSOM is a three-dimensional shape metrology method that can achieve sub-nanometer measurement sensitivity by analyzing sets of images acquired through-focus using a conventional optical microscope. Here we present a systematic noise-analysis study for optimizing data collection and data processing parameters for TSOM and then demonstrate how the optimized parameters affect defect analysis. We show that the best balance between signalto- noise performance and acquisition time can be achieved by judicious spatial averaging. Correct background-signal subtraction of the imaging-system inhomogeneities is also critical, as well as careful alignment of the constituent images used in differential TSOM analysis.", "Optical metrology techniques such as ellipsometry and reflectometry are very powerful for routine process monitoring and control in the modern semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, both methods rely on optical modeling therefore, the optical properties of all materials in the stack need to be characterized a priori or determined during characterization. Some processes such as ion implantation and subsequent annealing produce slight variations in material properties within wafer, wafer-to-wafer, and lot-to-lot; such variation can degrade the dimensional measurement accuracy for both unpatterned optical measurements as well as patterned (2D and 3D) scatterometry measurements. These variations can be accounted for if the optical model of the structure under investigation allows one to extract not just dimensional but also material information already residing within the optical spectra. This paper focuses on modeling of ion implanted and annealed poly Si stacks typically used in high-k technology. Monitoring of ion implantation is often a blind spot in mass production due to capability issues and other limitations of common methods. Typically, the ion implantation dose can be controlled by research-grade ellipsometers with extended infrared range. We demonstrate that multi-channel spectroscopic reflectometry can also be used for ion implant monitoring in the mass-production environment. Our findings are applicable across all technology nodes.", "Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) is a promising technique extending the 193-nm lithography to manufacture structures that are 20nm half pitch or smaller. This process adopts multiple sidewall spacer image transfers to split a rather relaxed design into a quarter of its original pitch. Due to the number of multiple process steps required for the pitch splitting in SAQP, the process error propagates through each deposition and etch, and accumulates at the final step into structure variations, such as pitch walk and poor critical dimension uniformity (CDU). They can further affect the downstream processes and lower the yield. The impact of this error propagation becomes significant for advanced technology nodes when the process specifications of device design CD requirements are at nanometer scale. Therefore, semiconductor manufacturing demands strict in-line process control to ensure a high process yield and improved performance, which must rely on precise measurements to enable corrective actions and quick decision making for process development. This work aims to provide a comprehensive metrology solution for SAQP.\nDuring SAQP process development, the challenges in conventional in-line metrology techniques start to surface. For instance, critical-dimension scanning electron microscopy (CDSEM) is commonly the first choice for CD and pitch variation control. However, it is found that the high aspect ratio at mandrel level processes and the trench variations after etch prevent the tool from extracting the true bottom edges of the structure in order to report the position shift. On the other hand, while the complex shape and variations can be captured with scatterometry, or optical CD (OCD), the asymmetric features, such as pitch walk, show low sensitivity with strong correlations in scatterometry. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is known to provide useful direct measurements of the pitch walk in crystalline arrays, yet the data analysis is influenced by the incoming geometry and must be used carefully.\nA successful implementation of SAQP process control for yield improvement requires the metrology issues to be addressed. By optimizing the measurement parameters and beam configurations, CDSEM measurements distinguish each of the spaces corresponding to the upstream mandrel processes and report their CDs separately to feed back to the process team for the next development cycle. We also utilize the unique capability in scatterometry to measure the structure details in-line and implement a \u201cpredictive\u201d process control, which shows a good correlation between the \u201cpredictive\u201d measurement and the cross-sections from our design of experiments (DOE). The ability to measure the pitch walk in scatterometry was also demonstrated. This work also explored the frontier of in-line XRD capability by enabling an automatic RSM fitting on tool to output pitch walk values. With these advances in metrology development, we are able to demonstrate the impacts of in-line monitoring in the SAQP process, to shorten the patterning development learning cycle to improve the yield.", "For yield improvement of 3D-device manufacturing, metrology for the variability of individual device-features is on hot issue. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) can be used for monitoring the individual cross-section. However, efficiency of process monitoring is limited by the speed of measurement including preparation of lamella sample. In this work we demonstrate speedy 3D-profile measurement of individual line-features without the lamella sampling. For instance, we make a-few-micrometer-wide and 45-degree-descending slope in dense line-features by using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) tool capable of 300mm-wafer. On the descending slope, obliquely cut cross-section of the line features appears. Then, we transfer the wafer to Critical-Dimension Secondary Electron Microscope (CDSEM) to measure the oblique cross-section in normal top-down view. As the descending angle is 45 degrees, the oblique cross-section looks like a cross-section normal to the wafer surface. For every single line-features the 3D dimensions are measured. To the reference metrology of the Scanning TEM (STEM), nanometric linearity and precision are confirmed for the height and the width under the hard mask of the line features. Without cleaving wafer the 60 cells on the wafer can be measured in 3 hours, which allows us of near-line process monitor of in-wafer uniformity.", "A simple and common practice to evaluate Block copolymers (BCP) self-assembly performances, is on a free surface wafer. With no guiding pattern the BCP designed to form line space pattern for example, spontaneously rearranges to form a random fingerprint type of a pattern. The nature of the rearrangement is dictated by the physical properties of the BCP moieties, wafer surface treatment and the self-assembly process parameters. Traditional CDSEM metrology algorithms are designed to measure pattern with predefined structure, like linespace or oval via holes. Measurement of pattern with expected geometry can reduce measurement uncertainty. Fingerprint type of structure explored in this dissertation, poses a challenge for CD-SEM measurement uncertainty and offers an opportunity to explore 2D metrology capabilities. To measure this fingerprints we developed a new metrology approach that combines image segmentation and edge detection to measure 2D pattern with arbitrary rearrangement. The segmentation approach enabled to quantify the quality of the BCP material and process, detecting 2D attributes such as: CD and CDU at one axis, and number of intersections, length and number of PS fragments, etched PMMA spaces and donut shapes numbers on the second axis. In this paper we propose a 2D metrology to measure arbitrary BCP pattern on a free surface wafer. We demonstrate experimental results demonstrating precision data, and characterization of PS-b-PMMA BCP, intrinsic period L0 = 38nm (Arkema), processed at different bake time and temperatures.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) applying chemical epitaxy is one of the promising lithographic solutions for next generation semiconductor device manufacturing. Especially, DSA lithography using coordinated line epitaxy (COOL) process is obviously one of candidates which could be the first generation of DSA applying PS-b-PMMA block copolymer (BCP) for sub-15nm dense line patterning . DSA can enhance the pitch resolutions, and can mitigate CD errors to the values much smaller than those of the originally exposed guiding patterns. On the other hand, local line placement error often results in a worse value, with distinctive trends depending on the process conditions. To address this issue, we introduce an enhanced measurement technology of DSA line patterns with distinguishing their locations in order to evaluate nature of edge placement and roughness corresponding to individual pattern locations by using images of CD-SEM. Additionally correlations among edge roughness of each line and each space are evaluated and discussed. This method can visualize features of complicated roughness easily to control COOL process. As a result, we found the followings. (1) Line placement error and line placement roughness of DSA were slightly different each other depending on their relative position to the chemical guide patterns. (2) In middle frequency area of PSD (Power Spectral Density) analysis graphs, it was observed that shapes were sensitively changed by process conditions of chemical stripe guide size and anneals temperature. (3) Correlation coefficient analysis using PSD was able to clarify characteristics of latent defect corresponding to physical and chemical property of BCP materials.", "The impact of EUV mask surface conditions on the patterned mask inspection process was investigated. The results of simulations show that the defect detection capability is degraded by the formation of a native oxide film on the surface of a Ru capped multilayer. This effect was assessed by constructing the secondary electron yield (SEY) curves of the EUV mask materials. These experimentally-obtained SEY curves were examined using semi-empirical Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation results demonstrated that a native oxide film increased the SEY, and that this effect varied with film thickness. The results suggest that defect detection capability will vary according to the thickness of the native oxide when employing an inspection system using an electron beam technique. Also of interest is the finding that the thickness of the native oxide film can be ascertained by fitting the SEY curves.", "In this paper we present a new AFM based nano-patterning technique that can be used for fast defect repairing of high resolution photomasks and possibly other high-speed nano-patterning applications. The proposed method works based on hammering the sample with tapping mode AFM followed by wet cleaning of the residuals. On the area where a specific pattern should be written, the tip-sample interaction force is tuned in a controlled manner by changing the excitation frequency of the cantilever without interrupting the imaging process. Using this method several patterns where transferred to different samples with imaging speed. While the pattern was transferred to the sample in each tracing scan line, the patterned sample was imaged in retracing scan line, thus the outcome was immediately visible during the experiment.", "Traditional metrology solutions face a range of challenges at the 1X node such as three dimensional (3D) measurement capabilities, shrinking overlay and critical dimension (CD) error budgets driven by multi-patterning and via in trench CD measurements. With advent of advanced technology nodes and 3D processing, an increasing need is emerging for in-die metrology including across-structure and structure-to-structure characterization. A myriad of work has emerged in the past few years intending to address these challenges from various aspects; in-die OCD with reduced spot size and tilt beam on traditional critical dimension scanning electron microscopy (CDSEM) for height measurements. This paper explores the latest capability offered by PeakForceTM Tapping Atomic Force Microscopy (PFT-AFM). The use of traditional harmonic tapping mode for scanning high aspect ratio, and complex \u201c3D\u201d wafer structures, results in limited depth probing capability as well as excessive tip wear. These limitations arise due to the large tip-sample interaction volume in such confined spaces. PeakForce Tapping eliminates these limitations through direct real time control of the tip-sample interaction contact force. The ability of PeakForce to measure, and respond directly to tip- sample interaction forces results in more detailed feature resolution, reduced tip wear, and improved depth capability. In this work, the PFT-AFM tool was applied for multiple applications, including the 14nm fin and replacement metal gate (RMG) applications outlined below. Results from DOE wafers, detailed measurement precision studies and correlation to reference metrology are presented for validation of this methodology. With the fin application, precision of 0.3nm is demonstrated by measuring 5 dies with 10 consecutive runs. Capability to resolve within-die and localized within-macro height variation is also demonstrated. Results obtained from the fin measurements support the increasing trend that measurements in the scribe line may not accurately represent in-die geometry, thus indicating the increasing need to measure the real device area. In-die measurement capability of peak force tapping AFM on wafers at post-poly-removal step in the RMG module is also evaluated. Precision of 1.22nm for the fin height under the gate, 1.06nm for the total gate height, and 0.77nm for the overburden are achieved in this application on a semidense structure. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first demonstration of a robust in-die measurement of the fin height under the gate.", "Nowadays most overlay metrology tools assess the overlay performance based on marker features which are deposited next to the functional device features within each layer of the semiconductor device. However, correct overlay of the relatively coarse marker features does not directly guarantee correct overlay of the much smaller device features. This paper presents the development of a tool that allows to measure the relative distance between the marker and device features within each layer of the semiconductor device, which can be used to improve the overlay at device feature level. In order to be effective, the marker to device feature distance should be measured with sub-nanometer measurement uncertainty over several millimeters range. Furthermore, the tool should be capable of profiling the marker features to allows prediction of the location interpretation of the optical diffraction based alignment sensors, which are sensitive for potential asymmetry of the marker features.\nTo enable this, a highly stable Atomic Force Microscope system is being developed. The probe is positioned relative to the wafer with a 6DOF controlled hexapod stage, which has a relatively large positioning range of 8x8mm. The position and orientation of this stage is measured relative to the wafer using 6 interferometers via a highly stable metrology frame. A tilted probe concept is utilized to allow profiling of the high aspect ratio marker and device features. Current activities are aimed at demonstrating the measurement capabilities of the developed AFM system.", "With the continuous shrink in pattern size and increased density, overlay control has become one of the most critical issues in semiconductor manufacturing. Recently, SEM based overlay of AEI (After Etch Inspection) wafer has been used for reference and optimization of optical overlay (both Image Based Overlay (IBO) and Diffraction Based Overlay (DBO)). Overlay measurement at AEI stage contributes monitor and forecast the yield after formation by etch and calibrate optical measurement tools. however those overlay value seems difficult directly for feedback to a scanner. Therefore, there is a clear need to have SEM based overlay measurements of ADI (After Develop Inspection) wafers in order to serve as reference for optical overlay and make necessary corrections before wafers go to etch. Furthermore, to make the corrections as accurate as possible, actual device like feature dimensions need to be measured post ADI. This device size measurement is very unique feature of CDSEM , which can be measured with smaller area. This is currently possible only with the CD-SEM. This device size measurement is very unique feature of CD-SEM , which can be measured with smaller area. In this study, we assess SEM based overlay measurement of ADI and AEI wafer by using a sample from an N10 process flow. First, we demonstrate SEM based overlay performance at AEI by using dual damascene process for Via 0 (V0) and metal 1 (M1) layer. We also discuss the overlay measurements between litho-etch-litho stages of a triple patterned M1 layer and double pattern V0. Second, to illustrate the complexities in image acquisition and measurement we will measure overlay between M1B resist and buried M1A-Hard mask trench. Finally, we will show how high accelerating voltage can detect buried pattern information by BSE (Back Scattering Electron). In this paper we discuss the merits of this method versus standard optical metrology based corrections.", "High order overlay and alignment models require good coverage of overlay or alignment marks on the wafer. But dense sampling plans are not possible for throughput reasons. Therefore, sampling plan optimization has become a key issue. We analyze the different methods for sampling optimization and discuss the different knobs to fine-tune the methods to constraints of high volume manufacturing. We propose a method to judge sampling plan quality with respect to overlay performance, run-to-run stability and dispositioning criteria using a number of use cases from the most advanced lithography processes.", "Advancing technology nodes with smaller process margins require improved photolithography overlay control. Overlay control at develop inspection (DI) based on optical metrology targets is well established in semiconductor manufacturing. Advances in target design and metrology technology have enabled significant improvements in overlay precision and accuracy. One approach to represent in-die on-device as-etched overlay is to measure at final inspection (FI) with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Disadvantages to this approach include inability to rework, limited layer coverage due to lack of transparency, and higher cost of ownership (CoO). A hybrid approach is investigated in this report whereby infrequent DI/FI bias is characterized and the results are used to compensate the frequent DI overlay results. The bias characterization is done on an infrequent basis, either based on time or triggered from change points. On a per-device and per-layer basis, the optical target overlay at DI is compared with SEM on-device overlay at FI. The bias characterization results are validated and tracked for use in compensating the DI APC controller. Results of the DI/FI bias characterization and sources of variation are presented, as well as the impact on the DI correctables feeding the APC system. Implementation details in a high volume manufacturing (HVM) wafer fab will be reviewed. Finally future directions of the investigation will be discussed.", "Designing metrology targets that mimic process device cell behavior is becoming a common component in overlay process control. For an advanced DRAM process (sub 20 nm node), the extreme illumination methods needed to pattern the critical device features makes it harder to control the aberration induced overlay delta between metrology target and device patterns. To compensate for this delta, a Non-Zero-Offset is applied to the metrology measurement that is based on a manual calibration measurement using CD-SEM Overlay. In this paper, we document how this mismatch can be minimized through the right choice of metrology targets and measurement recipe.", "In this paper we discuss the mechanism by which process variations determine the overlay accuracy of optical metrology. We start by focusing on scatterometry, and showing that the underlying physics of this mechanism involves interference effects between cavity modes that travel between the upper and lower gratings in the scatterometry target. A direct result is the behavior of accuracy as a function of wavelength, and the existence of relatively well defined spectral regimes in which the overlay accuracy and process robustness degrades (`resonant regimes\u2019). These resonances are separated by wavelength regions in which the overlay accuracy is better and independent of wavelength (we term these `flat regions\u2019). The combination of flat and resonant regions forms a spectral signature which is unique to each overlay alignment and carries certain universal features with respect to different types of process variations. We term this signature the `landscape\u2019, and discuss its universality. Next, we show how to characterize overlay performance with a finite set of metrics that are available on the fly, and that are derived from the angular behavior of the signal and the way it flags resonances. These metrics are used to guarantee the selection of accurate recipes and targets for the metrology tool, and for process control with the overlay tool. We end with comments on the similarity of imaging overlay to scatterometry overlay, and on the way that pupil overlay scatterometry and field overlay scatterometry differ from an accuracy perspective.", "With the increase of process complexity in advanced nodes, the requirements of process robustness in overlay metrology continues to tighten. Especially with the introduction of newer materials in the film-stack along with typical stack variations (thickness, optical properties, profile asymmetry etc.), the signal formation physics in diffraction-based overlay (DBO) becomes an important aspect to apply in overlay metrology target and recipe selection.\nIn order to address the signal formation physics, an effort is made towards studying the swing-curve phenomena through wavelength and polarizations on production stacks using simulations as well as experimental technique using DBO. The results provide a wealth of information on target and recipe selection for robustness. Details from simulation and measurements will be reported in this technical publication.", "As the scales of the semiconductor devices continue to shrink, accurate measurement and control of the overlay have been emphasized for securing more overlay margin. Conventional overlay analysis methods are based on the optical measurement of the overlay mark. However, the overlay data obtained from these optical methods cannot represent the exact misregistration between two layers at the circuit level. The overlay mismatch may arise from the size or pitch difference between the overlay mark and the real pattern. Pattern distortion, caused by CMP or etching, could be a source of the overlay mismatch as well. Another issue is the overlay variation in the real circuit pattern which varies depending on its location. The optical overlay measurement methods, such as IBO and DBO that use overlay mark on the scribeline, are not capable of defining the exact overlay values of the real circuit. Therefore, the overlay values of the real circuit need to be extracted to integrate the semiconductor device properly. The circuit level overlay measurement using CDSEM is time-consuming in extracting enough data to indicate overall trend of the chip. However DBM tool is able to derive sufficient data to display overlay tendency of the real circuit region with high repeatability. An E-beam based DBM(Design Based Metrology) tool can be an alternative overlay measurement method.\nIn this paper, we are going to certify that the overlay values extracted from optical measurement cannot represent the circuit level overlay values. We will also demonstrate the possibility to correct misregistration between two layers using the overlay data obtained from the DBM system.", "Having a well designed overlay metrology target is one of the ways to improve on-product overlay performance. The traditional screening method in which multiple targets types are added to successive reticle tape outs and then evaluated by trial-and-error may not suffice for the 7nm node and beyond. For instance, although segmentation of image-based overlay target has been reported by many as a means for improving overlay measurement, we find that segmentation does not guarantee improvement. In fact it can be undesirable. Fundamental understandings of metrology and wafer process are required to properly design the targets and carefully optimize them for a given process stack involving multilevel measurement. This paper investigates the Blossom, AIM, and scatterometry targets at the FEOL, MOL, and BEOL patterning levels in 7nm node to gain knowledge needed in order to comprehensively map out the overlay target solutions for future nodes.", "We present a metrology target design (MTD) framework based on co-optimizing lithography and metrology performance. The overlay metrology performance is strongly related to the target design and optimizing the target under different process variations in a high NA optical lithography tool and measurement conditions in a metrology tool becomes critical for sub-20nm nodes. The lithography performance can be quantified by device matching and printability metrics, while accuracy and precision metrics are used to quantify the metrology performance. Based on using these metrics, we demonstrate how the optimized target can improve target printability while maintaining the good metrology performance for rotated dipole illumination used for printing a sub-100nm diagonal feature in a memory active layer. The remaining challenges and the existing tradeoff between metrology and lithography performance are explored with the metrology target designer\u2019s perspective. The proposed target design framework is completely general and can be used to optimize targets for different lithography conditions. The results from our analysis are both physically sensible and in good agreement with experimental results.", "We demonstrate a novel method to establish a root cause for an overlay excursion using optical Scatterometry metrology. Scatterometry overlay metrology consists of four cells (two per directions) of grating on grating structures that are illuminated with a laser and diffracted orders measured in the pupil plane within a certain range of aperture. State of art algorithms permit, with symmetric considerations over the targets, to extract the overlay between the two gratings. We exploit the optical properties of the target to extract further information from the measured pupil images, particularly information that maybe related to any change in the process that may lead to an overlay excursion. Root Cause Analysis or RCA is being developed to identify different kinds of process variations (either within the wafer, or between different wafers) that may indicate overlay excursions. In this manuscript, we demonstrate a collaboration between Globalfoundries and KLA-Tencor to identify a symmetric process variation using scatterometry overlay metrology and RCA technique.", "Using SEM-EDS analysis on small (< 200 nm) particles is challenging, especially on a substrate with multiple background elements present. We will show a methodology combining three techniques to get the most information out of small particles. This method combines low energy EDS with a nontraditional approach to improve statistics in EDS and elemental mapping. This methodology is required for ASML\u2019s EUV platform, the NXE scanner to continue system improvement for a system showing already low defect count. The poor particle statistics on particle defects lead to a limited amount of particles available for diagnostics, which implies that all information on particle characteristics should be used for diagnostics.", "Actinic mask inspection for EUV lithography with targeted specification of sensitivity and throughput is a big challenge and effective solutions are needed. We present a novel method for actinic mask inspection, i.e. scanning scattering contrast microscopy. In this method the EUV mask is scanned with a beam of relatively small spot size and the scattered light is recorded with a pixel detector. Since the mask layout is known, the scattering profile of a defect-free mask at the detector can be calculated. The signal between the measured and calculated signal provides the deviation between the real mask and its ideal counterpart and a signal above a certain threshold indicates the existence of a defect within the illumination area. Dynamic software filtering helps to suppress strong diffraction from defect free structures and allows registration of faint defects with high sensitivity. With the continuous scan of the whole mask area, a defect map can be obtained with high throughput. Therefore, we believe that this method has the potential of providing an effective solution for actinic mask inspection. Here we discuss the basic principles of the method, present proof-of-principle experiments, describe the basic components of a feasible stand-alone tool and present early results of the performance estimations of such a tool.", "Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) has continually improved in accuracy over the years by adding more physically based models. Here, we further extend OPC modeling by adding the Analytical Linescan Model (ALM) to account for systematic biases in CD-SEM metrology. The ALM was added to a conventional OPC model calibration flow and the accuracy of the calibrated model with the ALM was compared to the standard model without the ALM using validation data. Without using any adjustable parameters in the ALM, OPC validation accuracy was improved by 5%. While very preliminary, these results give hope that modeling metrology could be an important next step in OPC model improvement.", "As process window margins for cutting edge DUV lithography continue to shrink, the impact of systematic patterning defects on final yield increases. Finding process window limiting hot spot patterns and monitoring them in high volume manufacturing (HVM) is increasingly challenging with conventional methods, as the size of critical defects can be below the resolution of traditional HVM inspection tools. We utilize a previously presented computational method of finding hot spot patterns by full chip simulation and use this to guide high resolution review tools by predicting the state of the hot spots on all fields of production wafers. In experiments with a 10nm node Metal LELELE vehicle we show a 60% capture rate of after-etch defects down to 3nm in size, at specific hot spot locations. By using the lithographic focus and dose correction knobs we can reduce the number of patterning defects for this test case by ~60%.", "Aberration sensitivity matching between overlay metrology targets and the device cell pattern has become a common requirement on the latest DRAM process nodes. While the extreme illumination modes used demand that the delta in aberration sensitivity must be optimized, it is effectively limited by the ability to print an optimum target that will meet detectability and accuracy requirements. Therefore, advanced OPC techniques are required to ensure printability and have optimal detectability performance while maintaining sufficient process window to avoid patterning or defectivity issues.\nIn this paper, we have compared various mark designs with real cell in terms of aberration sensitivity under the specific illumination condition. The specific illumination model was used for aberration sensitivity simulation while varying mask tones and target designs. Then, diffraction based simulation was conducted to analyze the effect of aberration sensitivity on the actual overlay values. The simulation results were confirmed by comparing the OL results obtained by diffraction based metrology with the cell level OL values obtained using Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope.", "A method of sub-nanometer uncertainty for the 3D-profile measurement using TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) images is proposed to standardize 3D-profile measurement through reference metrology. The proposed method has been validated for profiles of Si lines, photoresist features and advanced-FinFET (Fin-shaped Field-Effect Transistor) features in our previous investigations. However, efficiency of 3D-profile measurement using TEM is limited by measurement time including processing of the sample. In this article, we demonstrate a novel on-wafer 3D-profile metrology as \"FIB-to-CDSEM method\" with FIB (Focused Ion Beam) slope cut and CD-SEM (Critical Dimension Secondary Electron Microscope) measuring. Using the method, a few micrometer wide on a wafer is coated and cut by 45 degree slope using FIB tool. Then, the wafer is transferred to CD-SEM to measure the cross section image by top down CD-SEM measurement. We apply FIB-to-CDSEM method to CMOS sensor device. 3D-profile and 3D-profile parameters such as top line width and side wall angles of CMOS sensor device are evaluated. The 3D-profile parameters also are measured by TEM images as reference metrology. We compare the 3D-profile parameters by TEM method and FIB-to-CDSEM method. The average values and correlations on the wafer are agreed well between TEM and FIB-to- CDSEM methods.", "28nm metal 90nm pitch is one of the most challenging processes for computational lithography due to the resolution limit of DUV scanners and the variety of designs allowed by design rules. Classical two dimensional hotspot simulations and OPC correction isn\u2019t sufficient to obtain required process windows for mass production. This paper shows how three dimensional resist effects like top loss and line end shortening have been calibrated and used during the OPC process in order to achieve larger process window. Yield results on 28FDSOI product have been used to benchmark and validate gain between classical OPC and R3D OPC.", "Electron optics can assist in the fabrication of semiconductor devices in many challenges that arise from the ongoing decrease of structure size. Examples are augmenting optical lithography by electron beam direct write strategies and high-throughput imaging of patterned structures with multiple beam electron microscopes. We use multiple beam electron microscopy to image semiconductor wafers processed by electron beam lithography.", "Advanced technology nodes, 10nm and beyond, employing multi-patterning techniques for pitch reduction pose new process and metrology challenges in maintaining consistent positioning of structural features. Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) process is used to create the Fins in FinFET devices with pitch values well below optical lithography limits. The SAQP process bares compounding effects from successive Reactive Ion Etch (RIE) and spacer depositions. These processes induce a shift in the pitch value from one fin compared to another neighboring fin. This is known as pitch walking. Pitch walking affects device performance as well as later processes which work on an assumption that there is consistent spacing between fins. In SAQP there are 3 pitch walking parameters of interest, each linked to specific process steps in the flow. These pitch walking parameters are difficult to discriminate at a specific process step by singular evaluation technique or even with reference metrology such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). In this paper we will utilize a virtual reference to generate a scatterometry model to measure pitch walk for SAQP process flow.", "DSA lithography poses new challenges in LER/LWR metrology due to its self-organized and pitch-based nature. To cope with these challenges, a novel characterization approach with new metrics and updating the older ones is required. To this end, we focus on two specific challenges of DSA line patterns: a) the large correlations between the left and right edges of a line (line wiggling, rms(LWR)<rms(LER)) and b) the cross-line correlations, i.e. the resemblance of wiggling fluctuations of nearby lines. The first is quantified by the Line Center Roughness whose low-frequency part is related to the local placement errors of device structures. For the second, we propose the c-factor correlation function which quantifies the strength of the correlations between lines versus their horizontal distance in pitches. Also, we define roughness and uniformity parameters for the pitch changes along and across lines. The proposed characterization approach is applied to the analysis of line/space patterns obtained with the Liu-Nealey (LiNe) flow (post PMMA removal and pattern transfer) revealing the effects of pattern transfer on roughness and uniformity. Finally, we calculate the cfactor function of various Next-Generation Lithography techniques and reveal their distinct footprint on the extent of cross-line correlations.", "Multi-patterning lithography at the 10-nm and 7-nm nodes is driving the allowed overlay error down to extreme low values. Advanced high order overlay correction schemes are needed to control the process variability. Additionally the increase of the number of split layers results in an exponential increase of metrology complexity of the total overlay and alignment tree. At the same time, the process stack includes more hard-mask steps and becomes more and more complex, with as consequence that the setup and verification of the overlay metrology recipe becomes more critical. All of the above require a holistic approach that addresses total overlay optimization from process design to process setup and control in volume manufacturing. In this paper we will present the holistic overlay control flow designed for 10-nm and 7-nm nodes and illustrate the achievable ultimate overlay performance for a logic and DRAM use case. As figure 1 illustrates we will explain the details of the steps in the holistic flow. Overlay accuracy is the driver for target design and metrology tool optimization like wavelength and polarization. We will show that it is essential to include processing effects like etching and CMP which can result in a physical asymmetry of the bottom grating of diffraction based overlay targets. We will introduce a new method to create a reference overlay map, based on metrology data using multiple wavelengths and polarization settings. A similar approach is developed for the wafer alignment step. The overlay fingerprint correction using linear or high order correction per exposure (CPE) has a large amount of parameters. It is critical to balance the metrology noise with the ultimate correction model and the related metrology sampling scheme. Similar approach is needed for the wafer align step. Both for overlay control as well as alignment we have developed methods which include efficient use of metrology time, available for an in the litho-cluster integrated metrology use. These methods include a novel set models that efficiently describe different process fingerprints. We will explain the methods and show the benefits for logic and DRAM use cases.", "We have developed a fast three dimensional Monte-Carlo framework for the investigation of shotnoise induced side-wall roughness (SWR) formation. The calculation outline is demonstrated by an example for an exposure of a 100nm thick layer of negative tone resist (NTR) resist on top of an infinitely thick silicon substrate. We use our home built Monte-Carlo simulator for electron-matter interaction for the purpose of lithography. A pattern of an isolated line is written into the resist layer by scanning a beam with 20 keV electrons over an area of 32nm\u00d71\u03bcm (width and length). During the exposure, we use a spot size of 20 nm, beam step size of 4nm and a Poisson distributed exposure dose of 80 \u03bcC/cm2, 60 \u03bcC/cm2 and 40 \u03bcC/cm2. During the exposure of the sample, we record the locations of the inelastic events within the resist layer. The distribution of released acids is determined under the simplified assumption that every inelastic event corresponds to a release. We now construct a three dimensional image of the (in)solubility of the resist layer within a cuboid of 128 nm(256px) wide, 800 nm(1024px) in length and 100 nm(128px) in height. It is obtained by summing the contribution of all acids to every voxel in the three dimensional image. We have used a three dimensional Gaussian with \u03c3x,y,z = rd =5nm for the diffusion of the acid. The boundary between exposed and unexposed resist is determined by a threshold. The resulting image of the (in)solubility is analyzed in different ways by considering slices and three dimensional views of the border. The average line edge roughness (LER) is obtained by calculating the standard deviation (one-sigma) of the left and right border from yz-slices. By considering all slices, ranging from the top of the resist layer to the bottom of the substrate, the average LER as a function of the depth from the top surface of the resist layer is obtained. Shotnoise effects are observed as we decrease the exposure dose. An increased effect of shotnoise is observed near the vacuum and substrate interface. One contribution relates to the actual number of acids, which due to the scattering is less near the interface than away from the interface. Another contribution stems from the fact that no acids are found on the vacuum side nor on the substrate side.", "In principal, the critical dimension (CD) of Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) pattern is determined by the CD of the template pattern. Unless one template is changed to another, NIL does not have a knob for direct control of the CD, such as the exposure dose and focus in optical lithography. Alternatively, the CD would be controlled by adjusting the thickness of the residual layer underneath the NIL pattern and controlling the etching process to transfer the pattern to a substrate. Controlling the residual layer thickness (RLT) can change the etching bias, resulting in the control of the CD of etched pattern. RLT is controllable by the resist dispense condition of the inkjet. For CD control, the metrology of RLT and feedback of the results to the dispense condition are extremely important. Scatterometry is the most promising metrology for the task because it is nondestructive 3D metrology with high throughput. In this paper, we discuss how to control CD in the NIL process and propose a process control flow based on scatterometry.", "In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of scatterometry for the 2D and 3D isolation mounts on the substrate by applying the PML in the RCWA method. We analyze the reflectance from the silicon and resist single mount on the silicon substrates by changing the incident beam angles. First, we show the propagation properties of the electromagnetic fields propagating for the isolation mounts on the silicon substrates. Second, we examine the oblique incident reflectances for the TE and TM waves by changing the beam sizes and wavelengths. We show the reflectance properties by changing the mount length, width and height on the Si substrates. Finally, we examine the reflectances calculated by changing the wavelength for the oblique incident beams. Then, we understand that the scatterometry observation is possible for isolation mounts.", "The left side and right side line edge roughnesses (LER) of a line are compared for different conditions, such as through pitch, through critical dimension (CD), from horizontal to vertical line direction, from litho to etch. The investigation shows that the left and right side LER from lithography process are the same, however, the metrology can cause a 4-25% increase in the measured right side LER. The LER difference is related to the CDSEM e-beam scan direction.", "Optical scatterometry is a model based technique, which conventionally requires minimization of a predefined least square function. This minimization relies heavily on the measurement configuration: wavelength, incident angle, azimuthal angle, and sample position, which brings up the question of how to find the configuration that maximizes measurement accuracy. We propose a general measurement configuration optimization method based on error propagation theory and singular value decomposition, by which the measurement accuracy can be approximated as a function of a Jacobian matrix with respect to the measurement configurations. Simulation and experiments for a one-dimensional trapezoidal grating establishes the feasibility of the proposed method.", "Overlay control has become one of the most critical issues for semiconductor manufacturing. Advanced lithographic scanners use high-order corrections or correction per exposure to reduce the residual overlay. It is not enough in traditional feedback of overlay measurement by using ADI wafer because overlay error depends on other process (etching process and film stress, etc.). It needs high accuracy overlay measurement by using AEI wafer. WIS (Wafer Induced Shift) is the main issue for optical overlay, IBO (Image Based Overlay) and DBO (Diffraction Based Overlay). We design dedicated SEM overlay targets for dual damascene process of N10 by i-ArF multi-patterning. The pattern is same as device-pattern locally. Optical overlay tools select segmented pattern to reduce the WIS. However segmentation has limit, especially the via-pattern, for keeping the sensitivity and accuracy. We evaluate difference between the viapattern and relaxed pitch gratings which are similar to optical overlay target at AEI. CDSEM can estimate asymmetry property of target from image of pattern edge. CDSEM can estimate asymmetry property of target from image of pattern edge. We will compare full map of SEM overlay to full map of optical overlay for high order correction ( correctables and residual fingerprints).", "Shrinking technology nodes and smaller process margins require improved photolithography overlay control. Generally, overlay measurement results are modeled with Cartesian polynomial functions for both intra-field and inter-field models and the model coefficients are sent to an advanced process control (APC) system operating in an XY Cartesian basis. Dampened overlay corrections, typically via exponentially or linearly weighted moving average in time, are then retrieved from the APC system to apply on the scanner in XY Cartesian form for subsequent lot exposure. The goal of the above method is to process lots with corrections that target the least possible overlay misregistration in steady state as well as in change point situations. In this study, we model overlay errors on product using Zernike polynomials with same fitting capability as the process of reference (POR) to represent the wafer-level terms, and use the standard Cartesian polynomials to represent the field-level terms. APC calculations for wafer-level correction are performed in Zernike basis while field-level calculations use standard XY Cartesian basis. Finally, weighted wafer-level correction terms are converted to XY Cartesian space in order to be applied on the scanner, along with field-level corrections, for future wafer exposures. Since Zernike polynomials have the property of being orthogonal in the unit disk we are able to reduce the amount of collinearity between terms and improve overlay stability. Our real time Zernike modeling and feedback evaluation was performed on a 20-lot dataset in a high volume manufacturing (HVM) environment. The measured on-product results were compared to POR and showed a 7% reduction in overlay variation including a 22% terms variation. This led to an on-product raw overlay Mean + 3Sigma X&Y improvement of 5% and resulted in 0.1% yield improvement.", "We present a cost-effective focus monitoring technique based on the illumination and the target co-optimization. An advanced immersion scanner can provide the freeform illumination that enables the use of any kind of custom source shape by using a programmable array of thousands of individually adjustable micro-mirrors. Therefore, one can produce non-telecentricity using the asymmetric illumination in the scanner with the optimized focus target on the cost-effective binary OMOG mask. Then, the scanner focus variations directly translate into easily measurable overlay shifts in the printed pattern with high sensitivity (\u0394Shift/\u0394focus = 60nm/100nm). In addition, the capability of using the freeform illumination allows us to computationally co-optimize the source and the focus target, simultaneously, generating not only vertical or horizontal shifts, but also introducing diagonal pattern shifts. The focus-induced pattern shifts can be accurately measured by standard wafer metrology tools such as CD-SEM and overlay metrology tools.", "Gate to source/drain (S/D) short is the most common and detrimental failure mechanism for advanced process technology development in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor-Field-Effect-Transistor (MOSFET) device manufacturing. Especially for sub-1Xnm nodes, MOSFET device is more vulnerable to gate-S/D shorts due to the aggressive scaling. The detection of this kind of electrical short defect is always challenging for in-line electron beam inspection (EBI), especially new shorting mechanisms on atomic scale due to new material/process flow implementation. The second challenge comes from the characterization of the shorts including identification of the exact shorting location. In this paper, we demonstrate unique scan direction induced charging dynamics (SDCD) phenomenon which stems from the transistor level response from EBI scan at post metal contact chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) layers. We found that SDCD effect is exceptionally useful for gate-S/D short induced voltage contrast (VC) defect detection, especially for identification of shorting locations. The unique SDCD effect signatures of gate-S/D shorts can be used as fingerprint for ground true shorting defect detection. Correlation with other characterization methods on the same defective location from EBI scan shows consistent results from various shorting mechanism. A practical work flow to implement the application of SDCD effect for in-line EBI monitor of critical gate-S/D short defects is also proposed, together with examples of successful application use cases which mostly focus on static random-access memory (SRAM) array regions. Although the capability of gate-S/D short detection as well as expected device response is limited to passing transistors and pull-down transistors due to the design restriction from standard 6-cell SRAM structure, SDCD effect is proven to be very effective for gate-S/D short induced VC defect detection as well as yield learning for advanced technology development.", "Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) is widely applied in advanced sub-4X patterning technology, especially for the 1D resolution shrinkage of memory technology. As the application of SADP makes lithography minimum pitch down to half of design pitch with the remaining spacer aside core, its alignment mark and overlay (OVL) mark have to be well-segmented to ensure enough mark contrast. In this paper, we designed two types of image-based overlay (IBO) bar in bar (BIB) OVL target: bar-segmentation and background\u2013segmentation with different duty ratio. Based on these two designed types of marks, we focus on the OVL of 2nd photo layer to 1st SADP layer with the core removed (which means spacer grating structure remained). We studied the effect of the overlay target segmentation on the precision and robustness of wafer-level overlay performance. Different lithography processes were also studied, including single layer lithography and tri-layer lithography with planarized spacer grating structures. We found there are strong correlations between overlay measurement accuracy and background segmentation rules. The results of our study will be presented and discussed in this paper.", "In advanced optical lithography the requirements of focus control continues to tighten. Usable depth of focus (DoF) is already quite low due to typical sources of focus errors, such as topography, wafer warpage and the thickness of photoresist. And now the usable DoF is further decreased by hotspots (design and imaging hotspots). All these have put extra challenges to improve focus metrology, scanner focus stability calibrations and on-product correction mechanisms.\nAsymmetric focus targets are developed to address robustness in focus measurements using diffraction-based focus (DBF and \u03bcDBF) metrology. A new layout specific calibration methodology is introduced for baseline focus setup and control in order to improve scanner focus uniformity and stability using the measurements of the above mentioned asymmetric targets. A similar metrology is also used for on product focus measurements. Moreover, a few novel alternative methods are also investigated for on-product focus measurements.\nData shows good correlation between DBF and process on record (POR) method using traditional FEM. The new focus calibration demonstrated robustness, stability and speed. This technical publication will report the data from all the above activities including results from various product layers.", "A new focus monitor mask having novel grating structure is proposed to measure the focus variation of the scanner. The grating pattern composes of transparent line, opaque line, \u03c0-phase shift groove and \u03c0/2 -phase shift groove with their width ratio equivalent to 1:4:1:2. By using this structure, one of the first order and one of the second order of the diffraction spectrum are eliminated. Therefore, the lithography image is formed by the interference of the zeroth order and the left positive (or negative) 1st and 2nd orders, which is more sensitive to the subtle change of focus. The basic principle and characteristic of the proposed mask is described in this paper. Simulations with the lithography simulator PROLITH shows that the monitoring accuracy is improved more than 25%, compared with the conventional phase grating focus monitor (PGFM). The novel mask proposed in our job has potential to be an efficient candidate for measuring the defocus of scanner in the immersion lithography with hyper NA.", "Spacer multi patterning process continues to be a key enabler of future design shrinks in DRAM and NAND process flows. Improving Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU) for main features remains high priority for multi patterning technology and requires improved metrology and control solutions.\nIn this paper Spacer Patterning Technology is evaluated using an angle resolved scatterometry tool for both intra field control of the core CD after partition etch (S1) and interfield pitch-walking control after final etch (S1-S2). The intrafield measurements were done directly on device using dense sampling. The inter-field corrections were based on sparse full wafer measurements on biased OCD targets. The CDU improvement after partition-etch was verified by direct scatterometer and CD-SEM measurement on device. The final etch performance across wafer was verified with scatterometer on OCD target.\nThe scatterometer metrology in combination with the control strategy demonstrated a consistent CDU improvement of core (S1) intrafield CD after partition etch between 23-39% and 47-53% on interfield pitch-walking (S1-S2) after final etch. To confirm these improvements with CD-SEM, oversampling of more than 16 times is needed compared to scatterometer.\nBased on the results it is concluded that scatterometry in combination with the evaluated metrology and control strategy in principle qualifies for a spacer process CDU control loop in a manufacturing environment.", "In this paper, we present a study on the overlay (OVL) shift issue in contact (CT) layer aligned to poly-silicon (short as poly) layer (prior layer) in an advanced technology node [1, 2]. We have showed the wafer level OVL AEI-ADI shift (AEI: After Etch Inspection; ADI: After Developing Inspection; AEI-ADI: AEI minus ADI). Within the shot level map, there exists a center-edge difference. The OVL focus subtraction map can well match the OVL AEI-ADI shift map. Investigation into this interesting correlation finally leads to the conclusion of PR tilt. The film stress of the thick hard mask is responsible for the PR tilt. The method of OVL focus subtraction can therefore be a powerful and convenient tool to represent the OVL mark profile. It is also important to take into account the film deposition when investigating OVL AEI-ADI shift.", "As the semiconductor process technology moves into more advanced nodes, design and process induced systematic defects become increasingly significant yield limiters. Therefore, early detection of these defects is crucial. Focus Exposure Matrix (FEM) and Process Window Qualification (PWQ) are routine methods for discovering systematic patterning defects and establishing the lithography process window. These methods require the stepper to expose a reticle onto the wafer at various focus and exposure settings (also known as modulations). The wafer is subsequently inspected by a bright field, broadband plasma or an E-Beam Inspection tool using a high sensitivity inspection recipe (i.e. hot scan) that often reports a million or more defects. Analyzing this vast stream of data to identify the weak patterns and arrive at the optimal focus/exposure settings requires a significant amount of data reduction through aggressive sampling and nuisance filtering schemes. However, these schemes increase alpha risk, i.e. the probability of not catching some systematic or otherwise important defects within a modulation and thus reporting that modulation as a good condition for production wafers. In order to reduce this risk and establish a more accurate process window, we describe a technique that introduces image-and-design integration methodologies into the inspection data analysis workflow.\nThese image-and-design integration methodologies include contour extraction and alignment to design, contour-to-design defect detection, defective/nuisance pattern retrieval, confirmed defective/nuisance pattern overlay with inspection data, and modulation-related weak-pattern ranking. The technique we present provides greater automation, from defect detection to defective pattern retrieval to decision-making steps, that allows for statistically summarized results and increased coverage of the wafer to be achieved without an adverse impact on cycle time. Statistically summarized results, lead to objective assessments of the output; and increased coverage, in turn, leads to a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of each pattern defect and each focus/exposure modulation. Overall, this leads to a more accurate determination of the process window.", "The high-NA angle-resolved scatterometer YieldStar 1250D, with a small 12x12\u03bcm2 inspection area, has been used to inspect CD variation After Develop (ADI) and After Partition/Final Etch (APEI/AFEI) on various layers and features of a HVM DRAM process. During recipe set-up, CD-SEM data were used to verify full recipe quality. The high sampling density enabled by the small inspection area and high speed of the YieldStar angle-resolved scatterometer could be used to reveal various kinds of CD variations. An intra-field control-loop with scanner dose corrections was tested, using very dense ADI and APEI measurements, 400ppf, 4fields. This strategy demonstrated a 21% improvement in intra-field CDU, in line with expectations from predictions. Inter-field control loops with different strategies have been simulated for APEI CD control. To capture all variations in the inter-field fingerprints a dense sampling, 24ppf full wafer, in combination with a dynamic, context-based control strategy, appeared to be necessary. An improvement of 30% of the wafer CDU (excluding the intra-field) is feasible. For the Self-Aligned Double Patterning process, essential for the dense DRAM cells, the CD variation at APEI contributes to pitch-walking at final etch. Pitch walking is an alternating OV error, therefore these control strategies will also contribute to improvement of the OV control budget.", "We demonstrate a cost-effective automated rule based sparse sampling method that can detect the spatial variation of overlay errors as well as the overlay signature of the fields. Our technique satisfies the following three rules: (i) homogeneous distribution of ~200 samples across the wafer, (ii) equal number of samples in scan up and scan down condition and (iii) equal number of sampling on each overlay marks per field. When rule based samplings are implemented on the two products, the differences between the full wafer map sampling and the rule based sampling are within 3.5 nm overlay spec with residuals M+3\u03c3 of 2.4 nm (x) and 2.43 nm (y) for Product A and 2.98 nm (x) and 3.32 nm (y) for Product B.", "Overlay metrology performances highly depend on the detailed design of the measured target. Hence performing simulations is an essential tool for optimizing target design. We demonstrate for scatterometry overlay (SCOL) three key factors which enable consistency in ranking between simulated and measured metrology performance for target design. The first factor, to enable high fidelity simulations for the purpose of target design, is stack and topography verification of model inputs. We report in detail the best known film metrology methods required to achieve model integrity. The second factor is the method of calculation of metrology performance metrics based on target cell reflectivities from electro-magnetic (EM) simulations. These metrics enable ranking of different designs, and subsequent choice of the best performing designs among all simulated design options, the ranking methodology being the third factor. We apply the above steps to a specific stack, where five different designs have been considered. Simulated versus measured values are compared. A good agreement between simulation and measurement is achieved.", "In recent years overlay (OVL) control schemes have become more complicated in order to meet the ever shrinking margins of advanced technology nodes. As a result, this brings up new challenges to be addressed for effective run-to- run OVL control. This work addresses two of these challenges by new advanced analysis techniques: (1) sampling optimization for run-to-run control and (2) bias-variance tradeoff in modeling. The first challenge in a high order OVL control strategy is to optimize the number of measurements and the locations on the wafer, so that the \u201csample plan\u201d of measurements provides high quality information about the OVL signature on the wafer with acceptable metrology throughput. We solve this tradeoff between accuracy and throughput by using a smart sampling scheme which utilizes various design-based and data-based metrics to increase model accuracy and reduce model uncertainty while avoiding wafer to wafer and within wafer measurement noise caused by metrology, scanner or process. This sort of sampling scheme, combined with an advanced field by field extrapolated modeling algorithm helps to maximize model stability and minimize on product overlay (OPO). Second, the use of higher order overlay models means more degrees of freedom, which enables increased capability to correct for complicated overlay signatures, but also increases sensitivity to process or metrology induced noise. This is also known as the bias-variance trade-off. A high order model that minimizes the bias between the modeled and raw overlay signature on a single wafer will also have a higher variation from wafer to wafer or lot to lot, that is unless an advanced modeling approach is used. In this paper, we characterize the bias-variance trade off to find the optimal scheme. The sampling and modeling solutions proposed in this study are validated by advanced process control (APC) simulations to estimate run-to-run performance, lot-to-lot and wafer-to- wafer model term monitoring to estimate stability and ultimately high volume manufacturing tests to monitor OPO by densely measured OVL data.", "As device geometries shrink and the number of transistors on the wafer grows, new metrology solutions are required to support the development and production of next generation structures for the 10 nm node and beyond. This paper presents an innovative probe based microscope, the Rapid Probe Microscope (RPM), which is capable of obtaining nondestructive high resolution sub-nm information in all 3 dimensions and in a vacuum environment. The RPM is a platform supporting a novel probe detection and actuation system. It enables new imaging modes which are optimized for profiling narrow high aspect ratio structures as found in semiconductor devices. Additionally, the RPM can be operated in a vacuum environment allowing in-situ hybrid metrology solutions, for example operating alongside a CD or defect review SEM. Results are presented showing the imaging of thin lines and trenches, < 20 nm in width, using both a SEM and RPM to provide complementary information about the lateral and vertical dimensions of the structures. Comparison of images collected with different probes and at different sample locations demonstrates the ability of the RPM to operate consistently with long probe life and at high speed which is required for use in the High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) environment.", "In the process nodes of 10nm and below, the patterning complexity along with the processing and materials required has resulted in a need to optimize alignment targets in order to achieve the required precision, accuracy and throughput performance. Recent industry publications on the metrology target optimization process have shown a move from the expensive and time consuming empirical methodologies, towards a faster computational approach. ASML\u2019s Design for Control (D4C) application, which is currently used to optimize YieldStar diffraction based overlay (DBO) metrology targets, has been extended to support the optimization of scanner wafer alignment targets. This allows the necessary process information and design methodology, used for DBO target designs, to be leveraged for the optimization of alignment targets. In this paper, we show how we applied this computational approach to wafer alignment target design. We verify the correlation between predictions and measurements for the key alignment performance metrics and finally show the potential alignment and overlay performance improvements that an optimized alignment target could achieve.", "Requirements for on-product overlay, focus and CD uniformity continue to tighten in order to support the demands of 10nm and 7nm nodes. This results in the need for simultaneously accurate, robust and dense metrology data as input for closed-loop control solutions thereby enabling wafer-level control and high order corrections. In addition the use of opaque materials and stringent design rules drive the need for expansion of the available measurement wavelengths and metrology target design space.\nDiffraction based optical metrology has been established as the leading methodology for integrated as well as standalone optical metrology for overlay, focus and CD monitoring and control in state of the art chip manufacturing. We are presenting the new approaches to diffraction based optical metrology designed to meet the \u226410nm node challenges. These approaches have been implemented in the latest addition to the YieldStar metrology platform, the YS350E introducing a new way of acquiring and processing diffraction based metrology signals.\nIn this paper we will present the new detection principle and its impact on key performance characteristics of overlay and focus measurements. We will also describe the wide range of applications of a newly introduced increased measurement spot size, enabling significant improvements to accuracy and process robustness of overlay and focus measurements.\nWith the YS350E the optical CD measurement capability is also extended, to 10x10\u03bcm2 targets. We will discuss the performance and value of small targets in after-develop and after-etch applications.", "At the 28nm technology node and below, hot spot prediction and process window control across production wafers have become increasingly critical. We establish proof off concept for ASML\u2019s holistic lithography hot spot detection and defect monitoring flow, process window optimizer (PPWO), for a 228nm metal layer process. We demonstrate prediction and verification of defect occurrence on wafer that arise from focus variations exceeding process window margins of device hotspots. We also estimate the improvement potential if design aware scanner control was applied.", "Single crystal silicon wafers are the fundamental elements of semiconductor manufacturing industry. The wafers produced by Czochralski (CZ) process are very high quality single crystalline materials with known defects that are formed during the crystal growth or modified by further processing. While defects can be unfavorable for yield for some manufactured electrical devices, a group of defects like oxide precipitates can have both positive and negative impacts on the final device. The spatial distribution of these defects may be found by scattering techniques. However, due to limitations of scattering (i.e. light wavelength), many crystal defects are either poorly classified or not detected. Therefore a high throughput and accurate characterization of their shape and dimension is essential for reviewing the defects and proper classification. While scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can provide high resolution twodimensional images, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is essential for obtaining three-dimensional information of the defects of interest (DOI) as it is known to provide the highest vertical resolution among all techniques [1]. However AFM\u2019s low throughput, limited tip life, and laborious efforts for locating the DOI have been the limitations of this technique for defect review for 300 mm wafers. To address these limitations of AFM, automatic defect review AFM has been introduced recently [2], and is utilized in this work for studying DOI on 300 mm silicon wafer. In this work, we carefully etched a 300 mm silicon wafer with a gaseous acid in a reducing atmosphere at a temperature and for a sufficient duration to decorate and grow the crystal defects to a size capable of being detected as light scattering defects [3]. The etched defects form a shallow structure and their distribution and relative size are inspected by laser light scattering (LLS). However, several groups of defects couldn\u2019t be properly sized by the LLS due to the very shallow depth and low light scattering. Likewise, SEM cannot be used effectively for post-inspection defect review and classification of these very shallow types of defects. To verify and obtain accurate shape and three-dimensional information of those defects, automatic defect review AFM (ADR AFM) is utilized for accurate locating and imaging of DOI. In ADR AFM, non-contact mode imaging is used for non-destructive characterization and preserving tip sharpness for data repeatability and reproducibility. Locating DOI and imaging are performed automatically with a throughput of many defects per hour. Topography images of DOI has been collected and compared with SEM images. The ADR AFM has been shown as a non-destructive metrology tool for defect review and obtaining three-dimensional topography information.", "In this paper we will present the comparison study of these two methods on programmed errors of critical layers of 14nm technology node. Programmed OVL errors were made on certain fields during the exposure. Full coverage OVL measurements were performed using both IBO and DBO. Linear, HOPC and iHOPC modeling has been done from non-programmed fields. Then modeling has been subtracted from these certain programmed fields, and Reticle contribution was also calculated and subtracted. In this study, metrology measurement accuracy and stability can be feasible and more accurate OVL control is enabled by selecting better OVL measurement techniques.", "We present a novel metrology target design framework using the scanner exit pupil wavefront analysis together with Zernike sensitivity analysis (ZSA) based on the Monte-Carlo technique. The proposed method enables the design of robust metrology targets that maximize target process window (PW) while minimizing placement error discrepancies with device features in the presence of spatial and temporal variation of the aberration characteristics of an exposure tool. Knowing the limitations of lithography systems, design constraints, and detailed lithography information including illumination, mask type, etc., we can successfully design an optimal metrology target. We have validated our new metrology target design (MTD) method for one of the challenging DRAM active layer consisting of diagonal line and space patterns illuminated by a rotated extreme dipole source. We find that an optimal MTD target gives the maximized PW and the strong device correlation, resulting in the dramatic improvement of overall overlay performance. The proposed target design framework is completely general and can be used to optimize targets for different lithography conditions. The results from our analysis are both physically sensible and in good agreement with experimental results.", "In recent years a great deal of effort has been expended to try and reduce the reticle ESD damage problem. Methods are almost all based on the standard principles developed for the protection of ESD sensitive electronic devices \u2013 but reticles are not the same as electronic devices. Reticles are predominantly damaged by electric field rather than the conductive transfer of static charge, and the physical mechanisms that damage reticles are different from those that damage electronic devices. This paper explains why some of the established methods for ESD prevention are not the best way to protect reticles and in some cases actually increase the risk of reticle damage. Measurements are presented showing that, contrary to the widely held opinion and current practice in semiconductor manufacturing, static dissipative plastic is not the best material to use for the construction of reticle pods. An appropriate combination of insulating material and metallic shielding is shown to provide the best electrostatic protection for reticles.", "As pattern design rule of device shrinks, CD control becomes more critical and important especially for resistance devices. As CD (Critical Dimension) increases, CDU (Critical Dimension Uniformity) becomes worse generally. The question with this relationship is a starting point of our study. Mainly we focused on two points. One is which factor affects CDU. The other is whether CDU degradation with large CD happens at all cases or not. We have analyzed with simulation and experiment results about CDU with splitted mask layout CD under limited conditions such as same equipment, illumination and exposure dose. As a result, we will show the relationship between CD size and CDU.", "A novel method on advanced node for IBO (Image Based Overlay) data extraction accuracy is demonstrated in this work, and here some special design in triple-AIM (Advanced Imaging Metrology) is able to realize the approach.\nSince triple AIM design has 3 locations left for patterning layers insertion, a new design with 2 layers locations, location-A (inner) and location-B (middle), are generated by 1st pattering, i.e. once lithography exposure, and the 2 marks grouping are formed on dielectric through lithography and etching process with a predetermined overlay \"zero offset\" through original mask layout design, as illustrated in Fig. (1).\nAnd then, as following top photo resist layer, assumed location-C (outer), lithography patterning process, PR coating, exposure and development complete, full triple-AIM patterns is generated, and 3 sets of overlay data could be obtained, A to B, C to B, C to A.\nThrough re-calculating the overlay raw data of current (2nd patterning layer) to previous (1st patterning layer) layer by averaging [C to B] and [C to A], then theoretically the data extraction of sites would be more accuracy, since the variation of local marks signal, induced by inline process instability, could be minimized through the raw data averaging procedure.\nMoreover, from raw data [A to B], an extra monitor function for detections of the inline process variation, marks selection and recipe setting optimization could be obtained, since marks in [A] and [BB] locations are both generated in 1st patterning, and with the target \"zero\".\nSo if the raw data [A to BB] is bigger or smaller than \"zero\" in some degree, there should be some process issue or marks condition setting error in triple-AIM design.", "The integration of on-product diffraction-based focus (DBF) capability into the majority of immersion lithography layers in leading edge logic manufacturing has enabled new applications targeted towards improving cycle time and yield. A CD-based detection method is the process of record (POR) for excursion detection. The drawback of this method is increased cycle time and limited sampling due to CD-SEM metrology capacity constraints. The DBFbased method allows the addition of focus metrology samples to the existing overlay measurements on the integrated metrology (IM) system. The result enables the addition of measured focus to the SPC system, allowing a faster excursion detection method.\nFor focus targeting, the current method involves using a dedicated focus-exposure matrix (FEM) on all scanners, resulting in lengthy analysis times and uncertainty in the best focus. The DBF method allows the measurement to occur on the IM system, on a regular production wafer, and at the same time as the exposure. This results in a cycle time gain as well as a less subjective determination of best focus. A third application aims to use the novel onproduct focus metrology data in order to apply per-exposure focus corrections to the scanner. These corrections are particularly effective at the edge of the wafer, where systematic layer-dependent effects can be removed using DBFbased scanner feedback.\nThis paper will discuss the development of a methodology to accomplish each of these applications in a high-volume production environment. The new focus metrology method, sampling schemes, feedback mechanisms and analysis methods lead to improved focus control, as well as earlier detection of failures.", "Within the semiconductor lithographic process, alignment control is one of the most critical considerations. In order to realize high device performance, semiconductor technology is approaching the 10 nm design rule, which requires progressively smaller overlay budgets. Simultaneously, structures are expanding in the 3rd dimension, thereby increasing the potential for inter-layer distortion. For these reasons, device patterning is becoming increasingly difficult as the portion of the overlay budget attributed to process-induced variation increases. After lithography, overlay gives valuable feedback to the lithography tool; however overlay measurements typically have limited density, especially at the wafer edge, due to throughput considerations. Moreover, since overlay is measured after lithography, it can only react to, but not predict the process-induced overlay.\nThis study is a joint investigation in a high-volume manufacturing environment of the portion of overlay associated with displacement induced by a single process across many chambers. Displacement measurements are measured by Coherent Gradient Sensing (CGS) interferometry, which generates high-density displacement maps (>3 million points on a 300 mm wafer) such that the stresses induced die-by-die and process-by-process can be tracked in detail. The results indicate the relationship between displacement and overlay shows the ability to forecast overlay values before the lithographic process. Details of the correlation including overlay/displacement range, and lot-to-lot displacement variability are considered.", "Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) has become a viable computational lithography candidate in recent years as it can produce mask output that results in process latitude and CD control in the fab that is hard to match with conventional OPC/SRAF insertion approaches.\nAn approach to solving the inverse lithography problem as a nonlinear, constrained minimization problem over a domain mask pixels was suggested in the paper by Y. Granik \u201cFast pixel-based mask optimization for inverse lithography\u201d in 2006. The present paper extends this method to satisfy bridging and pinching constraints imposed on print contours.\nNamely, there are suggested objective functions expressing penalty for constraints violations, and their minimization with gradient descent methods is considered. This approach has been tested with an ILT-based Local Printability Enhancement (LPTM) tool in an automated flow to eliminate hotspots that can be present on the full chip after conventional SRAF placement/OPC and has been applied in 14nm, 10nm node production, single and multiple-patterning flows.", "On product wafers, scanner focus is better controlled at the wafer center than at the wafer edge. This is due, in a large part, to edge roll off effects [1]. This paper quantifies the impact of edge roll off on scanner levelling non-correctable errors and correlates this to on-product effects. The main contributors and mitigation methods are also discussed for a NXT:1950 scanner.", "Inspection of EUV mask substrates and blanks is demanding. We envision this is a good target application for massively parallel Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). We envision to do a full surface characterization of EUV masks with AFM enabling 1nm true 3D resolution over the entire surface. The limiting factor to do this is in the sensor itself: throughput is limited by the time that a cantilever needs to adjust its oscillation amplitude to the surface topography while scanning. We propose to use heavily damped cantilevers to maximize the measurement bandwidth. We show that using up to 20.000 cantilevers in parallel we can then reach a throughput of one 152\u00d7152mm2 substrate per 2 days with 1nm resolution.", "The semiconductor industry makes dramatic device technology changes over short time periods. As the semiconductor industry advances towards to the 10 nm device node, more precise management and control of processing tools has become a significant manufacturing challenge. Some processes require multiple tool sets and some tools have multiple chambers for mass production. Tool and chamber matching has become a critical consideration for meeting today\u2019s manufacturing requirements. Additionally, process tools and chamber conditions have to be monitored to ensure uniform process performance across the tool and chamber fleet. There are many parameters for managing and monitoring tools and chambers. Particle defect monitoring is a well-known and established example where defect inspection tools can directly detect particles on the wafer surface. However, leading edge processes are driving the need to also monitor invisible defects, i.e. stress, contamination, etc., because some device failures cannot be directly correlated with traditional visualized defect maps or other known sources. Some failure maps show the same signatures as stress or contamination maps, which implies correlation to device performance or yield.\nIn this paper we present process tool monitoring and matching using an interferometry technique. There are many types of interferometry techniques used for various process monitoring applications. We use a Coherent Gradient Sensing (CGS) interferometer which is self-referencing and enables high throughput measurements. Using this technique, we can quickly measure the topography of an entire wafer surface and obtain stress and displacement data from the topography measurement. For improved tool and chamber matching and reduced device failure, wafer stress measurements can be implemented as a regular tool or chamber monitoring test for either unpatterned or patterned wafers as a good criteria for improved process stability.", "One of the keys to successful mass production of sub-20nm nodes in the semiconductor industry is the development of an overlay correction strategy that can meet specifications, reduce the number of layers that require dedicated chuck overlay, and minimize measurement time. Three important aspects of this strategy are: correction per exposure (CPE), integrated metrology (IM), and the prioritization of automated correction over manual subrecipes.\nThe first and third aspects are accomplished through an APC system that uses measurements from production lots to generate CPE corrections that are dynamically applied to future lots. The drawback of this method is that production overlay sampling must be extremely high in order to provide the system with enough data to generate CPE. That drawback makes IM particularly difficult because of the throughput impact that can be created on expensive bottleneck photolithography process tools.\nThe goal is to realize the cycle time and feedback benefits of IM coupled with the enhanced overlay correction capability of automated CPE without impacting process tool throughput. This paper will discuss the development of a system that sends measured data with reduced sampling via an optimized layout to the exposure tool\u2019s computational modelling platform to predict and create \u201cupsampled\u201d overlay data in a customizable output layout that is compatible with the fab user CPE APC system. The result is dynamic CPE without the burden of extensive measurement time, which leads to increased utilization of IM.", "We report an optical inspection guided e-beam inspection method for inline monitoring and/or process change validation. We illustrate its advantage through the case of detection of buried voids/unlanding vias, which are identified as yield-limiting defects to cause electrical connectivity failures. We inspected a back end of line (BEOL) wafer after the copper electro plating and chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process with bright field inspection (BFI) and employed EBI to inspect full wafer with guidance of BFI klarf file. The dark voltage contrast defects were detected and confirmed as buried voids by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).", "The Rapid Nano is a particle inspection system developed by TNO for the qualification of EUV reticle handling equipment. The sensitivity of this system has been improved by model based design. Our model identified two parameters that could be tuned to be able to detect smaller particles. The first step is a multi azimuth illumination mode and the second parameter is the illumination wavelength. Here we report on the results of the Rapid Nano 4, which has both of these parameters optimized to have a sub 20 nm LSE detection limit on EUV mask blanks.", "The dimensional scaling in IC manufacturing strongly drives the demands on CD and defect metrology techniques and their measurement uncertainties. Defect review has become as important as CD metrology and both of them create a new metrology paradigm because it creates a completely new need for flexible, robust and scalable metrology software. Current, software architectures and metrology algorithms are performant but it must be pushed to another higher level in order to follow roadmap speed and requirements. For example: manage defect and CD in one step algorithm, customize algorithms and outputs features for each R&D team environment, provide software update every day or every week for R&D teams in order to explore easily various development strategies. The final goal is to avoid spending hours and days to manually tune algorithm to analyze metrology data and to allow R&D teams to stay focus on their expertise. The benefits are drastic costs reduction, more efficient R&D team and better process quality.\nIn this paper, we propose a new generation of software platform and development infrastructure which can integrate specific metrology business modules. For example, we will show the integration of a chemistry module dedicated to electronics materials like Direct Self Assembly features. We will show a new generation of image analysis algorithms which are able to manage at the same time defect rates, images classifications, CD and roughness measurements with high throughput performances in order to be compatible with HVM. In a second part, we will assess the reliability, the customization of algorithm and the software platform capabilities to follow new specific semiconductor metrology software requirements: flexibility, robustness, high throughput and scalability. Finally, we will demonstrate how such environment has allowed a drastic reduction of data analysis cycle time.", "We analyze performance of different customized models on baseliner overlay data and demonstrate the reduction in overlay residuals by ~10%. Smart Sampling sets were assessed and compared with the full wafer measurements. We found that performance of the grid can still be maintained by going to one-third of total sampling points, while reducing metrology time by 60%. We also demonstrate the feasibility of achieving time to time matching using scanner fleet manager and thus identify the tool drifts even when the tool monitoring controls are within spec limits. We also explore the scanner feedback constant variation with illumination sources.", "An efficient numerical method for computing angle-resolved light scattering off periodic arrays is presented. The method combines finite-element discretization with a Schur complement solver. A significant speed-up of the computations in comparison to standard finite-element method computations is observed.", "Optical critical dimension (OCD) measurement has been widely demonstrated as an essential metrology method for monitoring advanced IC process in the technology node of 90 nm and beyond. However, the rapidly shrunk critical dimensions of the semiconductor devices and the increasing complexity of the manufacturing process bring more challenges to OCD. The measurement precision of OCD technology highly relies on the optical hardware configuration, spectral types, and inherently interactions between the incidence of light and various materials with various topological structures, therefore sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization are very critical in the OCD applications. This paper presents a method for seeking the optimum sensitive measurement configuration to enhance the metrology precision and reduce the noise impact to the greatest extent. In this work, the sensitivity of different types of spectra with a series of hardware configurations of incidence angles and azimuth angles were investigated. The optimum hardware measurement configuration and spectrum parameter can be identified. The FinFET structures in the technology node of 14 nm were constructed to validate the algorithm. This method provides guidance to estimate the measurement precision before measuring actual device features and will be beneficial for OCD hardware configuration.", "Overlay metrology target design is an essential step prior to performing overlay measurements. This step is done through the optimization of target parameters for a given process stack. A simulation tool is therefore used to improve measurement performances. This work shows how our Metrology Target Design (MTD) simulator helps significantly in the target design process. We show the role of film and Optical CD measurements in improving significantly the fidelity of the simulations. We demonstrate that for various target design parameters we are capable of predicting measured performance metrics by simulations and correctly rank various designs performances.", "Contamination tolerances in semiconductor manufacturing processes have changed dramatically in the past two decades, reaching below 20 nm according to the guidelines of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. The move to narrower line widths drives the need for innovative filtration technologies that can achieve higher particle/contaminant removal performance resulting in cleaner process fluids. Nanoporous filter membrane metrology tools that have been the workhorse over the past decade are also now reaching limits. For example, nanoparticle (NP) challenge testing is commonly applied for assessing particle retention performance of filter membranes. Factors such as high NP size dispersity, low NP detection sensitivity, and high NP particle-filter affinity impose challenges in characterizing the next generation of nanoporous filter membranes. We report a novel bio-surrogate, 5 nm DNA-dendrimer conjugate for evaluating particle retention performance of nanoporous filter membranes. A technique capable of single molecule detection is employed to detect sparse concentration of conjugate in filter permeate, providing >1000- fold higher detection sensitivity than any existing 5 nm-sized particle enumeration technique. This bio-surrogate also offers narrow size distribution, high stability and chemical tunability. This bio-surrogate can discriminate various sub-15 nm pore-rated nanoporous filter membranes based on their particle retention performance. Due to high bio-surrogate detection sensitivity, a lower challenge concentration of bio-surrogate (as compared to other NPs of this size) can be used for filter testing, providing a better representation of customer applications. This new method should provide better understanding of the next generation filter membranes for removing defect-causing contaminants from lithography processes.", "Improving wafer On Product Overlay (OPO) is becoming a major challenge in lithography, especially for multipatterning techniques like N-repetitive Litho-Etch steps (LEN, N \u2265 2). When using different scanner settings and litho processes between inter-layer overlays, intra-field overlay control becomes more complicated. In addition to the Image Placement Error (IPE) contribution, the TWINSCANTM lens fingerprint in combination with the exposure settings is playing a significant role as well. Furthermore the scanner needs to deal with dynamic fingerprints caused by for instance lens and/or reticle heating.\nThis paper will demonstrate the complementary RegC\u00ae and TWINSCANTM solution for improving the OPO by cooptimizing the correction capabilities of the individual tools, respectively. As a consequence, the systematic intra-field fingerprints can be decreased along with the overlay (OVL) error at wafer level. Furthermore, the application could be utilized for extending some of the scanner actuators ranges by inducing a pre-determined signatures. These solutions perfectly fit into the ASML Litho InSight (LIS) product in which feedforward and feedback corrections based on YieldStar overlay and other measurements are used to improve the OPO. While the TWINSCANTM scanner corrects for global distortions (up to third order) - scanner Correctable Errors ( CE), the RegC\u00ae application can correct for the None Correctable Errors (NCE) by making the high frequency NCE into a CE with low frequency nature. The RegC\u00ae induces predictable deformation elements inside the quartz (Qz) material of the reticle, and by doing so it can induce a desired pre-defined signature into the reticle. The deformation introduced by the RegC\u00ae is optimized for the actual wafer print taking into account the scale and ortho compensation by the scanner, to correct for the systematic fingerprints and the wafer overlay. These two applications might be very powerful and could contribute to achieve a better OPO performance.", "In order to meet the increasing storage capacity demand and reduce bit cost of NAND flash memories, 3D stacked vertical flash cell array has been proposed. In constructing 3D NAND flash memories, the bit number per unit area is increased as increasing the number of stacked layers. However, the increased number of stacked layers has made the film stress control extremely important for maintaining good process quality. The residual film stress alters the wafer shape accordingly several process impacts have been readily observed across wafer, such as film deposition non-uniformity, etch rate non-uniformity, wafer chucking error on scanner, materials coating/baking defects, overlay degradation and critical dimension (CD) non-uniformity.\nThe residual tensile and compressive stresses on wafers will result in concave and convex wafer shapes, respectively. This study investigates within-wafer CD uniformity (CDU) associated with wafer shape change induced by the 3D NAND flash memory processes. Within-wafer CDU was correlated with several critical parameters including different wafer bow heights of concave and convex wafer shapes, photo resists with different post exposure baking (PEB) temperature sensitivities, and DoseMapper compensation. The results indicated the trend of within-wafer CDU maintains flat for convex wafer shapes with bow height up to +230um and concave wafer shapes with bow height ranging from 0 ~ -70um, while the within-wafer CDU trends up from -70um to -246um wafer bow heights. To minimize the within-wafer CD distribution induced by wafer warpage, carefully tailoring the film stack and thermal budget in the process flow for maintaining the wafer shape at CDU friendly range is indispensable and using photo-resist materials with lower PEB temperature sensitivity is also suggested. In addition, DoseMapper compensation is also an alternative to greatly suppress the within-wafer CD non-uniformity but the photo-resist profile variation induced by across-wafer PEB temperature non-uniformity attributed to wafer warpage is uncorrectable, and the photo-resist profile variation is believed to affect across-wafer etch bias uniformity to some degree.", "As design rules for leading edge devices have shrunk to 1x nm size and below, device patterns have become sensitive to sub-10nm size defects. Additionally, defectivity and yield are now increasingly dominated by systematic patterning defects. A method for identifying and inspecting these hot spot (HS) locations is necessary for both technology development and High Volume Manufacturing (HVM). In order to achieve sufficient statistical significance across the wafer for a specific product and layer, a guided, high-speed e-beam inspection system is needed to cover a significant amount of high-volume hot spot locations for process window monitoring. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of a novel, highthroughput e-beam hot spot inspection tool, SkyScanTM 5000, on a 10nm back-end-of-line (BEOL) wafer patterned using a triple lithography-etch process. ASML\u2019s high-resolution, design-aware computational hot spot inspection is used to identify relevant hot spot locations, including overlay-sensitive patterns. We guide the e-beam tool to these Points of Interest (POI) and obtain experimental data from inspection of 430k wafer locations. The large amount of data allows detection of wafer-level and intra-field defect signatures for a large number of hot spot patterns.", "Advancement of the next generation technology nodes and emerging memory devices demand tighter lithographic focus control. Although the leveling performance of the latest-generation scanners is state of the art, challenges remain at the wafer edge due to large process variations. There are several customer configurable leveling control options available in ASML scanners, some of which are application specific in their scope of leveling improvement. In this paper, we assess the usability of leveling non-correctable error models to identify yield limiting edge dies. We introduce a novel dies-inspec based holistic methodology for leveling optimization to guide tool users in selecting an optimal configuration of leveling options. Significant focus gain, and consequently yield gain, can be achieved with this integrated approach. The Samsung site in Hwaseong observed an improved edge focus performance in a production of a mid-end memory product layer running on an ASML NXT 1960 system. 50% improvement in focus and a 1.5%p gain in edge yield were measured with the optimized configurations.", "The trend in microelectronics fabrication is to produce nano-features measuring down to 10 nm and finer. The PPT levels of organic and inorganic contaminants in the photoresist, solvent and cleaning solutions are becoming a major processing variable affecting the process capability and defectivity. The photoresist usually contains gels, metals, and particulates that could interfere with the lithography process and cause microbridging defects. Nano filters of 5 nm polypropylene, 5 nm polyethylene, and 10 nm natural nylon were used to filter propylene glycol methyl ether acetate PGMEA containing 50 ppb of Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb. All filters were effective in removing trivalent Al, Cr, and Fe metals indicating the mechanism for their removal as mechanical sieving. However, the nylon was also very effective in removing the divalent metals showing adsorptive properties. Furthermore, the metal removal of the nylon membrane was studied as a function of surface chemistry. Natural and charged 40 nm nylon membranes were tested and found that charged nylon is more effective for metal removal.", "In the semiconductor manufacturing process, defects often occur due to a marginal process window that affects the lithography and etch processes. These defects can result in bridging patterns and overlay issues, which consequently cause electrical shorts and partially etched vias producing electrical opens. SEM tools are used to find electrical failures through voltage contrast techniques. Manufacturers who fabricate with older process technology nodes often need to use their tool set more efficiently. This paper demonstrates an application of conventional SEM review with image to golden reference image inspection capabilities in Automatic Process Inspection (API ) mode to perform electrical inspections of die features.\nThis paper details how to use a SEM review tool to detect systematic electrical defects. This methodology can prove beneficial while monitoring and developing patterning techniques for a specific design rule by catching electrical shorts and opens that are more visible at a lower resolution inspection used in process monitoring. Outcomes of this effort show that conventional review SEM techniques, using known areas prone to process inconsistencies derived from features pushing the design rule, have the capability to effectively and efficiently monitor fabrication process while implemented in a production setting at process nodes between 100 to 200 nm. Using e-beam review tools offers several advantages and disadvantages. This paper demonstrates that by using a SEM review tool and selecting die locations for imaging that are more likely to fail electrically, manufacturers can use SEM automatic review capabilities more effectively and efficiently. The application developed may also be applied in fabrication facilities that have limited yield monitoring capacity.\nThis paper is a result of collaboration between Applied Materials and Microchip Technology Inc.", "This study explores the feasibility of Automated Defect Classification (ADC) with a Surface Scanning Inspection System (SSIS). The defect classification was based upon scattering sensitivity sizing curves created via modeling of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). The BRDF allowed for the creation of SSIS sensitivity/sizing curves based upon the optical properties of both the filmed wafer samples and the optical architecture of the SSIS.\nThe elimination of Polystyrene Latex Sphere (PSL) and Silica deposition on both filmed and bare Silicon wafers prior to SSIS recipe creation and ADC creates a challenge for light scattering surface intensity based defect binning. This study explored the theoretical maximal SSIS sensitivity based on native defect recipe creation in conjunction with the maximal sensitivity derived from BRDF modeling recipe creation.\nSingle film and film stack wafers were inspected with recipes based upon BRDF modeling. Following SSIS recipe creation, initially targeting maximal sensitivity, selected recipes were optimized to classify defects commonly found on non-patterned wafers. The results were utilized to determine the ADC binning accuracy of the native defects and evaluate the SSIS recipe creation methodology.\nA statistically valid sample of defects from the final inspection results of each SSIS recipe and filmed substrate were reviewed post SSIS ADC processing on a Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Native defect images were collected from each statistically valid defect bin category/size for SEM Review.\nThe data collected from the Defect Review SEM was utilized to determine the statistical purity and accuracy of each SSIS defect classification bin.\nThis paper explores both, commercial and technical, considerations of the elimination of PSL and Silica deposition as a precursor to SSIS recipe creation targeted towards ADC. Successful integration of SSIS ADC in conjunction with recipes created via BRDF modeling has the potential to dramatically reduce the workload requirements of a Defect Review SEM and save a significant amount of capital expenditure for 450mm SSIS recipe creation.", "We have developed a new focus measurement method based on analyzing SEM images that can help to control a scanner. In advanced semiconductor fabrication, rigorous focus control of the scanner has been required because focus error causes a defect. Therefore, it is essential to ensure focus error are detected at wafer fabrication. In the past, the focus has been measured using test patterns made outside of the chip by optical metrology system. Thus, present focus metrology system can\u2019t measure the focus of an arbitrary point in the chip. The new method enables a highly precise focus measurement of the arbitrary point of the chip based on a focus plane of a reference scanner. The method estimates the focus amount by analyzing side wall shapes of circuit patterns of SEM images. Side wall shapes are quantified using multisliced contours extracted from SEM-images high accuracy. By using this method, it is possible to measure the focus of the arbitrary circuit pattern area of the chip without a test pattern. We believe the method can contribute to control the scanner and to detect hot spots which appear by focus error. This new method and the evaluation results will be presented in detail in this paper.", "In phase-shifting Fizeau interferometers, phase-shift errors and multiple-beam interference are the most common sources of systematic error affecting high-precision phase measurements. Nonsinusoidal waveforms can be minimized by applying synchronous detection with more than four samples. However, when phase-shift calibration is inaccurate, these algorithms cannot eliminate the effects of nonsinusoidal characteristics. Moreover, when measuring the surface profile of highly reflective samples, the calculated phase is critically determined not only by the decrease in the fringe contrast, but also by the coupling error between the harmonics and phase-shift errors. In this study, we calculate phase errors using phase-shifting algorithms that take into account the coupling error. We show that the 4N \u2013 3 algorithm, which consists of a polynomial window function and a discrete Fourier transform term, results in the smallest phase error. As a demonstration, the surface profile of a highly reflective silicon wafer is measured using a wavelength-tuning Fizeau interferometer and the 4N \u2013 3 algorithm.", "Advanced process photolithography masks require more and more controls for registration versus design and critical dimension uniformity (CDU). The distribution of the measurement points should be distributed all over the whole mask and may be denser in areas critical to wafer overlay requirements. This means that some, if not many, of theses controls should be made inside the customer die and may use non-dedicated patterns. It is then mandatory to access the original layout database to select patterns for the metrology process.\nFinding hundreds of relevant patterns in a database containing billions of polygons may be possible, but in addition, it is mandatory to create the complete metrology job fast and reliable. Combining, on one hand, a software expertise in mask databases processing and, on the other hand, advanced skills in control and registration equipment, we have developed a Mask Dataprep Station able to select an appropriate number of measurement targets and their positions in a huge database and automatically create measurement jobs on the corresponding area on the mask for the registration metrology system. In addition, the required design clips are generated from the database in order to perform the rendering procedure on the metrology system.\nThis new methodology has been validated on real production line for the most advanced process. This paper presents the main challenges that we have faced, as well as some results on the global performances.", "The quality of patterns printed on wafer may be attributed to factors such as process window control, pattern fidelity, overlay performance, and metrology. Each of these factors play an important role in making the process more effective by ensuring that certain design- and process-specific parameters are kept within acceptable variation. Since chip size and pattern density are increasing accordingly, in-line real time catching the in-chip weak patterns/defects per million opportunities (WP-DPMO) plays more and more significant role for product yield with high density memory. However, the current in-line inspection tools focus on single layer defect inspection, not effectively and efficiently to catch multi-layer weak patterns/defects even through voltage contrast and/or special test structure design [1]-[2]. In general, the multi-layer weak patterns/defects are escaped easily by using in-line inspection and cause ignorance of product dysfunction until off-line time-consuming final PFA/EFA will be used.\nTo effectively and efficiently in-line real time monitor the potential multi-layer weak patterns, we quantify the bridge electrical metric between contact and gate electrodes into CD physical metric via big data from the larger field of view (FOV: 8k x 16k with 3 nm pixel equalizes to image main field size 34 um x 34 um @ 3 nm pixel) e-beam quality image contour compared to layout GDS database (D2DB) as shown in Fig. 1. Hadoop-based distributed parallel computing is implemented to improve the performance of big data architectures, Fig. 2. Therefore, the state of art in-line real time catching in-chip potential multi-layer weak patterns can be proven and achieved by following some studying cases [3]. Therefore, manufacturing sources of variations can be partitioned to systematic and random variations by applying statistical techniques based on the big data fundamental infrastructures. After big data handling, the in-chip CD and AA variations are distinguished by their spatial correlation distance. For local variations (LV) there is no correlation, whereas for global variations (GV) the correlation distance is very large [7]-[9]. This is the first time to certificate the validation of spatial distribution from the affordable bias contour big data fundamental infrastructures. And then apply statistical techniques to dig out the variation sources. The GV come from systematic issue, which could be compensated by adaptive LT condition or OPC correction. But LV comes from random issue, which being considered as intrinsic problem such as structure, material, tool capability\u2026 etc.\nIn this paper studying, we can find out the advanced technology node SRAM contact CD local variation (LV) dominates in total variation, about 70%. It often plays significant in-line real time catching WP-DPMO role of the product yield loss, especially for wafer edge is the worst loss within wafer distribution and causes serious reliability concern. The major root cause of variations comes from the PR material induced burr defect (LV), the second one comes from GV enhanced wafer edge short opportunity, which being attributed to three factors, first one factor is wafer edge CD deliberated enlargement for yield improvement as shown in Fig. 10. Second factor is overlaps/AA shifts due to tool capability dealing with incoming wafer\u2019s war page issue and optical periphery layout dependent working pitch issue as shown in Fig. 9 (1)., the last factor comes from wafer edge burr enhanced by wafer edge larger Photo Resistance (PR) spin centrifugal force.\nAfter implementing KPIs such as GV related AA/CD indexes as shown in Fig. 9 (1) and 10, respectively, and LV related burr index as shown in Fig. 11., we can construct the parts per million (PPM) level short probability model via multi-variables regression, canonical correlation analysis and logistic transformation. The model provides prediction of PPM level electrical failure by using in-line real time physical variation analysis. However in order to achieve Total Quality Management (TQM), the adaptive Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts can be implemented to in-line real time catch PPM level product malfunction at manufacturing stage. Applying for early stage monitor likes incoming raw material, Photo Resistance (PR) \u2026 etc., the LV related burr KPI SPC charts could be a powerful quality inspection vehicle. To sum up the paper\u2019s contributions, the state of art in-line real time catching in-chip potential multi-layer physical weak patterns can be proven and achieved effectively and efficiently to associate with PPM level product dysfunction.", "Wafer leveling data are usually used inside the exposure tool for ensuring good focus, then discarded. This paper describes the implementation of a monitoring and analysis solution to download these data automatically, together with the correction profiles applied by the scanner. The resulting height maps and focus residuals form the basis for monitoring metrics tailored to catching tool and process drifts and excursions in a high-volume manufacturing (HVM) environment.\nIn this paper, we present four six cases to highlight the potential of the method: wafer edge monitoring, chuck drift monitoring, correlations between focus residuals and overlay errors, and pre-process monitoring by chuck fingerprint removal.", "A novel classification methodology is constructed for Electron Beam (E-Beam) die-to-database (D2DB) inspection results on contact and via layers. It is a design guided defects classification flow that helps to pin-point true defects from a large amount of false alarm defects. Die-to-database E-beam inspection has remarkable features that can help find systematic defects such as Damaged Via and Missing Via; which will be reported as DVC (Dark Voltage Contrast) defects. However, the D2DB result usually reports millions of defects that lie on both \u2018active via\u2019 and \u2018floating via\u2019, the former being defects-of-interest (DOI), and the latter being of little significance. The indiscriminant mixture of DOI (on active vias) and nuisance (on floating vias) is a challenge in the use of D2DB for finding systematic via defects. We overcome this challenge by overlaying the E-beam defect location onto the design layout file (GDS or OASIS) and tracing the path of the via to determine whether or not it connects to the active or diffusion layer. Our proposed flow uses Net Tracing Classification (NTC) feature in Anchor Hotspot Solution (AHS) to classify all the reported DVC defects into different groups, according to the electrical connectivity of the contact. This classification involves multiple interconnected process layers. All the reported DVC defects will be classified into three groups: (1) Real DVC defects, in which the net traces down to active layer; (2) False DVC type 1, in which the net traces down to gate (which is always dark); (3) False DVC type 2, in which the net traces down to floating metal (which is always dark as well). This enhanced defect classification is greatly helpful in separating real DVC contact/via defects from false alarms. It has a secondary benefit of reducing the total number of defects, which is helpful for subsequent in-depth data analysis. In addition, the verified real DVC locations can be used to generate care areas for E-Beam die-to-die (D2D) inspection, which can effectively improve throughput and reduce the turn-around-time (TAT). In this paper, we will discuss a use case at the Vx layer.", "Immersion technology has successfully extends the application of ArF lithography in the semiconductor. However, as we further push the k1 factor below 0.3, the patterning fidelities degrade significantly. In this paper, a novel method to quantify the mask fidelity of complex 2D patterns is proposed. With this method, the critical dimension (CD) error of both edge placement error (EPE) and corner rounding can be well described by using 2 indices \"bias\" and \"blur\" respectively. The \"bias\" is defined as the CD offset between the mask and the targets, and the \"blur\" is a derived term that can well represent the mask rounding. These 2 indices are not only able to describe the mask quality but also able to link with model parameters that are used in optical proximity correction (OPC) and some other applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the methodology and quantify the actual mask quality on the complex and critical 2D patterning in the advanced nodes.", "Most advanced wafer fabs have embraced complex pattern decoration, which creates numerous challenges during in-fab reticle qualification. These optical proximity correction (OPC) techniques create assist features that tend to be very close in size and shape to the main patterns as seen in Figure 1. A small defect on an assist feature will most likely have little or no impact on the fidelity of the wafer image, whereas the same defect on a main feature could significantly decrease device functionality. In order to properly disposition these defects, reticle inspection technicians need an efficient method that automatically separates main from assist features and predicts the resulting defect impact on the wafer image. Analysis System (ADAS) defect simulation system[1]. Up until now, using ADAS simulation was limited to engineers due to the complexity of the settings that need to be manually entered in order to create an accurate result. A single error in entering one of these values can cause erroneous results, therefore full automation is necessary. In this study, we propose a new method where all needed simulation parameters are automatically loaded into ADAS. This is accomplished in two parts. First we have created a scanner parameter database that is automatically identified from mask product and level names. Second, we automatically determine the appropriate simulation printability threshold by using a new reference image (provided by the inspection tool) that contains a known measured value of the reticle critical dimension (CD). This new method automatically loads the correct scanner conditions, sets the appropriate simulation threshold, and automatically measures the percentage of CD change caused by the defect. This streamlines qualification and reduces the number of reticles being put on hold, waiting for engineer review. We also present data showing the consistency and reliability of the new method, along with the impact on the efficiency of in-fab reticle qualification.", "CD-SAXS capabilities are evaluated using a Ultra-SAXS setup allowing measurement of large reciprocal space maps with a high resolution configuration. The measured structures are: i) Tungsten lines gratings and ii) Si-ARC (Silicon Antireflective Coating) lines gratings both deposited onto a thin silicon membrane (100 nm thick). Advanced data reduction is performed thanks to reverse Monte Carlo simulations. Line period, line width, sidewall angle are extracted. Stitching effect was also detected and its period was determined. Peak broadening with peak order is discussed in terms of period dispersion and cumulative roughness. Amplitude and period of lateral roughness is also determined through complementary measurements performed at ESRF.", "One requirement for advanced lithography remains suitable incoming wafer topography. We propose that local wafer flatness be visualized and quantified using the techniques developed for wafer front-surface nanotopography. This is a significant change in that existing wafer topography metrology tools do not enable our proposed approach.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) has been recognized as the most promising candidate for the manufacture of semiconductor devices for the 7 nm node and beyond. A key point in the successful introduction of EUV lithography in high volume manufacture (HVM) is the effective EUV dose utilization while simultaneously realizing ultra-high resolution and low line edge roughness (LER). Here we show EUV resist sensitivity improvement with the use of a photosensitized chemically amplified resist PSCARTM system. The evaluation of this new chemically amplified resist (CAR) as performed using EUV interference lithography (EUV-IL) is described and the fundamentals are discussed.", "EUV photoacid generation efficiency has been described primarily in terms of the EUV photon absorption by the PAG or the resist matrix and the production of low energy photoelectrons, which are reported as being ultimately responsible for the high quantum efficiencies reported in EUV resists (<1). Such observation led to a number of recent studies on PAGs with variable electron affinity (EA) and reduction potential (Ered) presumably conducive to a differential EUV photoelectron harvesting efficiency. However, such studies either did not disclose the PAG chemical structures, replaced the EUV source with an e-beam source, or lacked a fundamental discussion of the underlying physical mechanisms behind EUV PAG decomposition. In this work, we report the EUV photospeed of a methacrylatebased resist formulated with a battery of openly disclosed isostructural sulfonium PAGs covering a wide range of EA\u2019s and Ered\u2019s, to unveil any preferential photoelectron scavenging effect. In parallel, several iodonium PAGs are also tested in order to compare the direct EUV photon absorption route to the photoelectron-based decomposition path. Contrarily to what has been widely reported, we have found no direct correlation whatsoever between photospeed and the calculated EA\u2019s or experimental Ered\u2019s for the isostructural sulfonium PAGs studied. Instead, we found that iodonium PAGs make more efficient use of the available EUV power due to their higher photoabsorption cross-section. Additionally, we determined a cation size effect for both PAG groups, which is able to further modulate the acid generation efficiency. Finally, we present a formal explanation for the unselective response towards photoelectron harvesting based on the stabilization of the PAG cation by bulky substituent groups, the spatial and temporal range of the transient photoelectron and the differences in electron transfer processes for the different systems studied.", "The relative importance of secondary electrons in delivering energy in photoresist films was assessed by performing large area exposures and by quantifying the inelastic mean free path of electrons in a leading chemically amplified positive tone EUV resist. A low energy electron microscope was used to directly pattern large (~15\u03bcm x 20\u03bcm) features with 15-80 eV electrons followed by analyzing the resulting dissolution rate contrast curve data. In the 40 to 80 eV regime the energy delivery was found to scale roughly proportionally with electron energy. In 15 to 30 eV regime however, this energy scaling did not explain the resist thickness loss data. The dose required to lower the resist thickness down to 20 nm was found to be 2-5X larger for 15 eV electrons than for 20, 25 and 30 eV electrons. Using scattering models from the literature including phonon scattering and optical data deduced electron energy loss spectroscopy and optical reflectometry, the inelastic mean free path values at energies between 10 eV and 92 eV range between about 2.8 and 0.6 nm respectively.", "Optimizing the photochemistry of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresists should provide faster, more efficient resists which would lead to greater throughput in manufacturing. The fundamental reaction mechanisms in EUV resists are believed to be due to interactions with energetic electrons liberated by ionization. Identifying the likelihood (or cross section) of how these photoelectrons interact with resist components is critical to optimizing the performance of EUV resists. Chemically amplified resists utilize photoacid generators (PAGs) to improve sensitivity; measuring the cross section of electron induced decomposition of different PAGs will provide insight into developing new resist materials. To study the interactions of photoelectrons generated by EUV absorption, photoresists were exposed to electron beams at energies between 80 and 250 eV. The reactions between PAG molecules and electrons were measured using a mass spectrometer to monitor the levels of small molecules produced by PAG decomposition that outgassed from the film. Comparing the cross sections of a variety of PAG molecules can provide insight into the relationship between chemical structure and reactivity to the electrons in their environments. This research is a part of a larger SEMATECH research program to understand the fundamentals of resist exposures to help in the development of new, better performing EUV resists.", "This work focuses on the application of a high speed atomic force microscope (HS-AFM) for the in situ visualization / quantification of the resist dissolution process. This technique, as reported in the past, has provided useful pointers on the formation of resist patterns during dissolution. This paper discusses about an investigation made on the quantification of what we refer to as \u201cdissolution unit size\u201d or the basic units of patterning material dissolution. This was done through the establishment of an originally developed analysis method which extracts the difference between two succeeding temporal states of the material film surface (images) to indicate the amount of change occurring in the material film at a specific span of time. Preliminary experiments with actual patterning materials were done using a positive-tone EUV model resist composed only of polyhydroxystyrene (PHS)-based polymer with a molecular weight of 2,500 and a polydispersity index of 1.2. In the absence of a protecting group, the material was utilized at a 50nm film thickness with post application bake of 90\u00b0C/60s. The resulting film is soluble in the alkali-based developer even without exposure. Results have shown that the dissolution components (dissolution unit size) of the PHS-based material are not of fixed size. Instead, it was found that aside from one constantly dissolving unit size, another, much larger dissolution unit size trend also occurs during material dissolution. The presence of this larger dissolution unit size suggests an occurrence of \"polymer clustering\". Such polymer clustering was not significantly present during the initial stages of dissolution (near the original film surface) but becomes more persistently obvious after the dissolution process reaches a certain film thickness below the initial surface.", "Understanding of stochastic phenomena is essential to the development of highly sensitive resist for nanofabrication. In this study, we investigated the stochastic effects in a chemically amplified resist consisting of poly(4-hydroxystyrene-co-t-butyl methacrylate), triphenylsulfonium nonafluorobutanesulfonate (an acid generator), and tri-n-octylamine (a quencher). The SEM images of resist patterns were analyzed, using Monte Carlo simulation on the basis of the sensitization and reaction mechanisms of chemically amplified extreme ultraviolet resists. It was estimated that \u00b10.82\u03c3 fluctuation of the number of protected units per polymer molecule led to line edge roughness formation. Here, \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the number of protected units per polymer molecule after postexposure baking.", "In extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, 92 eV photons are used to expose photoresists. Typical EUV resists are organic-based and chemically amplified using photoacid generators (PAGs). Upon exposure, PAGs produce acids which catalyze reactions that result in changes in solubility. In EUV lithography, photo- and secondary electrons (energies of 10- 80 eV) play a large role in PAG acid-production. Several mechanisms for electron-PAG interactions (e.g. electron trapping, and hole-initiated chemistry) have been proposed. The aim of this study is to explore another mechanism \u2013 internal excitation \u2013 in which a bound PAG electron can be excited by receiving energy from another energetic electron, causing a reaction that produces acid. This paper explores the mechanism of internal excitation through the analogous process of electron-induced fluorescence, in which an electron loses energy by transferring that energy to a molecule and that molecule emits a photon rather than decomposing. We will show and quantify electron-induced fluorescence of several fluorophores in polymer films to mimic resist materials, and use this information to refine our proposed mechanism. Relationships between the molecular structure of fluorophores and fluorescent quantum yield may aid in the development of novel PAGs for EUV lithography.", "We characterized EIDEC metal resist for EUV lithography by various measurement methods. The low-voltage aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy showed the morphology of metal resists in nanometer regions and enabled studying the distribution of resist component in the resist film. The zirconium oxide metal resist kept the core-shell structure in the resist films and the titanium oxide metal resist showed the aggregation in the film. X-ray diffractometry and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation showed the amorphous structure with short-range order of the zirconium oxide metal resist. X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy of the zirconium oxide-methacrylic acid metal resist showed the decomposition of the shell molecules and the increase of electron density at zirconium atoms after the EUV exposure. Infrared (IR) spectra indicated that the shell molecules made the various bindings to the metal core and the specific vibrational mode of shell molecules showed the divergent responsivity to the irradiation wavenumber of the IR Free electron laser.", "Challenges of processing metal containing materials need to be addressed in order apply this technology to Behavior of metal containing materials on coater/developer processing including coating process, developer process and tool metal contamination is studied using CLEAN TRACKTM LITHIUS ProTM Z (Tokyo Electron Limited). Through this work, coating uniformity and coating film defectivity were studied. Metal containing material performance was comparable to conventional materials. Especially, new dispense system (NDS) demonstrated up to 80% reduction in coating defect for metal containing materials. As for processed wafer metal contamination, coated wafer metal contamination achieved less than 1.0E10 atoms/cm2 with 3 materials. After develop metal contamination also achieved less than 1.0E10 atoms/cm2 with 2 materials. Furthermore, through the metal defect study, metal residues and metal contamination were reduced by developer rinse optimization.", "Inorganic resists are of interest for nanomanufacturing due to the potential for high resolution, low line width roughness, and high sensitivity. The combination of high absorption coefficient elements and radiation sensitive ligands can improve inorganic resist sensitivity while still allowing high contrast for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. A prototypical resist is Hf(OH)4-2x-2y(O2)x(SO4)y\u00b7qH2O (HafSOx), which has both high absorption coefficient elements (Hf) and radiation sensitive ligands (peroxides). Herein, we evaluate the use of electron stimulated desorption (ESD) to characterize HafSOx. These results indicate that the peroxo species are extremely radiation sensitive, even for low kinetic energy electrons that approximate the range of electron energies expected during EUV exposures. The primary desorption products from HafSOx are O2 and H2O, where the time evolution suggest much faster desorption kinetics for O2. These data provide insight into the radiation-induced changes responsible for the solubility transition upon exposure and dissolution during development, and the role of low kinetic energy electrons in these processes. The following describes our experimental methodology for the ESD studies, and the specific kinetic model used to extract total desorption cross sections from the ESD data.", "Metal oxide nanoparticle resists have recently emerged as next generation photoresist materials which exhibit promising performance for extreme ultraviolet lithography. In this present work, we are able to show our ability to synthesize and well characterize small uniform metal oxide nanoparticles, to present stability study of the nanoparticles in the resist solvent over time, to pattern ~20 nm features by electron beam lithography, and to provide an insight into the insolubilization mechanism of the resist system.", "We present a comprehensive study of the roughness metrics of different resists. Dense line/space (L/S) images of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), different chemically amplified resists (CARs), and metal oxide based resists have been patterned by extreme ultraviolet interference lithography (EUV-IL). The three line width roughness metrics: r.m.s. value \u03c3LWR, correlation length \u03be and roughness exponent \u03b1, were measured by metrological analysis of top down SEM images and compared for the different resists imaged here. It was found, that all metrics are required to fully describe the roughness of each resist. Our measurements indicate that few of the state-of-the- art resists tested here can meet the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) requirements for \u03c3LWR. The correlation length \u03be has been found to be considerably higher in polymer-based materials in comparison to non-polymers. The roughness exponent \u03b1, interpreted using the concept of fractal geometry, is mainly affected by acid diffusion in CARs where it produces line edges with a higher complexity than in non-CAR resists. These results indicate that different resists platforms show very different LWR resist metrics and roughness is not only manifested in the \u03c3LWR but in all parameters. Therefore, all roughness metrics should be taken into account in the performance comparison of the resist, since they can have a substantial impact on the device performance.", "The continuously scaling of complex device geometries is driving by the self-aligned multiple patterning techniques. Depending on such simplified LS scaling, FinFET design rule has been accelerated to unidirectional design layout. [1] In particular Fin, Gate and Metal layers are based on grating with cutting/blocking scheme, these process have become high volume manufacturing techniques in N14 and beyond.[2,3] On the other hand, immersions based pitch scaling of contact hole, via and cutmask processes are required multiple lithography and etching passes.[4] Overlay management is not only the overlay accuracy of layer to layer, to determine the placement error and patterning fidelity in single layer. In this work, focusing on the placement in hole pattern, total placement error budget will be discussed from the viewpoints of metrology, inspection, Mask, OPC and wafer processing. In addition, hole shrink and hole healing techniques have more significant factors in terms of design-process technology co-optimization for N7 and beyond.[5]", "This paper demonstrates that another class of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs) exists, distinct from through silicon via centric and monolithic 3D-ICs. Furthermore, it is possible to create devices that are 3D at the device level (i.e. with active channels oriented in each of the three coordinate axes), by performing standard CMOS fabrication operations at an angle with respect to the wafer surface into high aspect ratio silicon substrates using membrane projection lithography (MPL). MPL requires only minimal fixturing changes to standard CMOS equipment, and no change to current state-of-the-art lithography. Eliminating the constraint of 2D planar device architecture enables a wide range of new interconnect topologies which could help reduce interconnect resistance/capacitance, and potentially improve performance.", "Negative tone imaging (NTI) process is a method for obtaining a negative-tone reversal pattern by developing with an organic solvent. As NTI process can break-through the resolution limit of a conventional positive tone development (PTD) process at specific pattern such as trenches and contact holes, it have been applied for a mass production in 20nm and 14nm nodes devices. In NTI system, because a developer is changed from a hydrophilic aqueous solution to a hydrophobic organic solvent, it is possible to review the common resist stack which is optimized for a PTD process. In this paper, we examined the possibility of a bi-layer process using a Si-containing NTI resist. Etching selectivity between the Si-NTI resist and a SOC improved by raising Si-content of the Si-NTI resist, but resolution deteriorates as a trade-off. By suppressing swelling behavior of the Si-NTI resist with a polymer structure control, we overcame this trade-off. As a result, in sub-90 nm pitch L/S and CH patterns, the resolution of the Si-NTI resist achieved comparable level to a conventional NTI resist. In addition, SOC etching was successfully carried out by using the Si-NTI resist pattern as an etching hard mask.", "We developed the novel process and material which can prevent the pattern collapse issue perfectly. The process was Dry Development Rinse (DDR) process, and the material used in this process was DDR Material (DDRM). DDRM was containing siloxane polymer which could be replaced the space area of the photo resist pattern. And finally, the reversed pattern would be created by dry etching process without any pattern collapse issue.\nThis novel process was useful not only in positive tone development (PTD) process but also in negative tone development (NTD) process. We newly developed DDRM for NTD process. Novel DDRM consist of special polymer and it used organic solvent system. So, new DDRM showed no mixing property with NTD photo resist and it has enough etch selectivity against NTD photo resist.\nImage reversal was successfully achieved by combination of NTD process and DDR process keeping good pattern quality. Tone reverse pattern below hp 18nm was obtained without any pattern collapse issue, which couldn\u2019t be created by just using normal NTD process.", "Enormous advances have been made in recent years to design sub 40nm dense contact hole pattern with local CD uniformity (CDU) that the process can tolerate. Negative tone development process (NTD) on 193nm photoresists has achieved this to a large extent without the requirement of additional processing steps on the patterned layer. With further shrinking of size of the subsequent nodes, the demand to produce smaller patterns with wider process window, low defectivity, and improved CDU is increasing, and reaching beyond what can be achieved through NTD alone. A number of techniques are in practice today to achieve this, most notably, implementation of a collar of Atomic Layer Deposited SiO2 (ALD) on photoresist or substrate. However, in recent years, various material suppliers have also proposed shrink chemistries to achieve this. In this paper, we have provided fundamental characterization of shrink via application of spin-on agents (organic as well as aqueous) on the post-imaged pattern. We have also compared them for their shrink capacity, defect tendency, dry etch capability and ease of implementation in the process flow. In addition, we have provided recommendations on which technique is suitable for a given set of process prerequisites.", "Directed Self Assembly (DSA) has gained increased momentum in recent years as a cost-effective means for extending lithography to sub-30nm pitch, primarily presenting itself as an alternative to mainstream 193i pitch division approaches such as SADP and SAQP. Towards these goals, IMEC has excelled at understanding and implementing directed self-assembly based on PS-b-PMMA block co-polymers (BCPs) using LiNe flow [1]. These efforts increase the understanding of how block copolymers might be implemented as part of HVM compatible DSA integration schemes. In recent contributions, we have proposed and successfully demonstrated two state-of-the-art CMOS process flows which employed DSA based on the PS-b-PMMA, LiNe flow at IMEC (pitch = 28 nm) to form FinFET arrays via both a \u2018cut-last\u2019 and \u2018cut-first\u2019 approach [2-4]. Therein, we described the relevant film stacks (hard mask and STI stacks) to achieve robust patterning and pattern transfer into IMEC\u2019s FEOL device film stacks. We also described some of the pattern placement and overlay challenges associated with these two strategies. In this contribution, we will present materials and processes for FinFET patterning and integration towards sub-20 nm pitch technology nodes. This presents a noteworthy challenge for DSA using BCPs as the ultimate resolution for PS-b-PMMA may not achieve such dimensions. The emphasis will continue to be towards patterning approaches, wafer alignment strategies, the effects of DSA processing on wafer alignment and overlay.", "Directed self-assembly of block copolymers is a promising candidate to address grand challenges towards new generations of low-cost, high-resolution nanopatterning technology. Over the past decade, poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) has been the most popular block copolymer applied in this area. However, further scaling towards pitches below 20 nm is hindered by its relatively low segregation strength between constituent blocks, characterized by a low Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, \u03c7 (~ 0.038 at r.t). To reach sub-10 nm feature dimensions, many high- \u03c7 block copolymer materials and processes are currently being studied. Here we investigate the DSA of PSb- PMMA with blended ionic liquid (IL) on chemically-patterned substrates via thermal annealing with a free surface. In this materials system, by adding low volume fraction of IL, a substantially higher \u03c7 than the pure block copolymer is achieved with manageable change in surface and interfacial properties so that poly(styrene-random-methyl methacrylate) brushes may be used to control substrate wetting behavior, and the blend could be assembled using thermal annealing with a free surface. In other words, PS-b-PMMA/IL may serve as a high- \u03c7 drop-in replacement for PS-b-PMMA. In this work, we provide key DSA results to determine if PS-b-PMMA/IL blends would offer a solution for sub-10 nm lithography.", "The overall quality and processing capability of lithographic materials are critical for ensuring high device yield and performance at sub-20nm technology nodes in a high volume manufacturing environment. Insufficient process margin and high line width roughness (LWR) cause poor manufacturing control, while high defectivity causes product failures.\nIn this paper, we focus on the most critical layer of a sub-20nm technology node LSI device, and present an improved method for characterizing both lithographic and post-patterning defectivity performance of state-of-the-art immersion photoresists. Multiple formulations from different suppliers were used and compared. Photoresists were tested under various process conditions, and multiple lithographic metrics were investigated (depth of focus, exposure dose latitude, line width roughness, etc.). Results were analyzed and combined using an innovative approach based on advanced software, providing clearer results than previously available. This increased detail enables more accurate performance comparisons among the different photoresists. Post-patterning defectivity was also quantified, with defects reviewed and classified using state-of-the-art inspection tools.\nCorrelations were established between the lithographic and post-patterning defectivity performances for each material, and overall ranking was established among the photoresists, enabling the selection of the best performer for implementation in a high volume manufacturing environment.", "Gridded design rules[1] is major process in configuring logic circuit used 193-immersion lithography. In the scaling of grid patterning, we can make 10nm order line and space pattern by using multiple patterning techniques such as self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP) and litho-etch- litho-etch (LELE)[2][3][5] . On the other hand, Line cut process has some error parameters such as pattern defect, placement error, roughness and X-Y CD bias with the decreasing scale. Especially roughness and X-Y CD bias are paid attention because it cause cut error and pattern defect. In this case, we applied some smoothing process to care hole roughness[4]. Each smoothing process showed different effect on X-Y CD bias. In this paper, we will report the pattern controllability comparison of trench and block + inverse. It include X-Y CD bias, roughness and process usability. Furthermore we will discuss optimum method focused on X-Y CD bias when we use additional process such as smoothing and shrink etching .", "In this paper we report on our studies of the dynamic process of resist development in real time. Using High Speed \u2013 Atomic Force Microscopy (HS-AFM) in dilute developer solution, changes in morphology and nanomechanical properties of patterned resist were monitored. The Bruker Dimension FastScan AFMTM was applied to analyze 193 nm acrylic-based immersion resists in developer. HS-AFM operated in Peak Force mapping mode allowed for concurrent measurements of image topography resist stiffness, adhesion to AFM probe and deformation during development. In our studies we focused on HS-AFM topography data as it readily revealed detailed information about initial resist morphology, followed by a resist swelling process and eventual dissolution of the exposed resist areas. HS-AFM showed potential for tracking and understanding development of patterned resist films and can be useful in evaluating the dissolution properties of different resist designs.", "Strong resist shrinkage effects have been widely observed in resist profiles after negative tone development (NTD) and therefore must be taken into account in computational lithography applications. However, existing lithography simulation tools, especially those designed for full-chip applications, lack resist shrinkage modeling capabilities because they are not needed until only recently when NTD processes begin to replace the conventional positive tone development (PTD) processes where resist shrinkage effects are negligible. In this work we describe the development of a physical resist shrinkage (PRS) model for full-chip lithography simulations and present its accuracy evaluation against experimental data.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) with block-copolymers (BCP) is a promising lithography extension technique to scale below 30nm pitch with 193i lithography. Continued scaling toward 20nm pitch or below will require material system improvements from PS-b-PMMA. Pattern quality for DSA features, such as line edge roughness (LER), line width roughness (LWR), size uniformity, and placement, is key to DSA manufacturability. In this work, we demonstrate finFET devices fabricated with DSA-patterned fins and compare several BCP systems for continued pitch scaling. Organic-organic high chi BCPs at 24nm and 21nm pitches show improved low to mid-frequency LER/LWR after pattern transfer.", "We report the synthesis and characterization of novel block copolymer (BCP) materials for the directed self-assembly (DSA) nanolithography applications. Specifically, the poly(t-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) block in the styrenic block copolymers have been chemically modified to a fluorinated block for the enhancement of the BCP \u03c7-parameters. dPSb- PtBA had been first synthesized by anionic polymerization to prepare a well-defined BCP precursor with narrow polydispersity for the fluorination of PtBA block. Then, the precursor BCP was chemically modified by transalcoholysis of the PtBA-block with 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. This strategy offers the advantage of flexibility and controllability to tailor the \u03c7-parameter, while maintaining the narrow molecular weight distribution of the BCP materials for the advanced lithography applications. The transmission electron microscopy/small angle x-ray scattering (TEM/SAXS) characterization results of the modified BCP consisting of poly(fluoroalkylate) and PS supported the development of highly ordered lamellar domains in bulk.", "Properties of new block copolymers systems, specifically designed to reach large periods for the features, are compared to the ones exhibited by classical PS-b-PMMA materials of same dimensions. Conducted studies, like free-surface defects analysis, mild-plasma tomography experiments, graphoepitaxy-guided structures, etch-transfer\u2026 indicate much better performances, in terms of achievable film-thicknesses with perpendicular features, defects levels, and dimensional uniformities, for the new system than for the classical PS-b-PMMA. These results clearly highlight unique and original solutions toward an early introduction of DSA technology into large lithographic nodes.", "To extend directed self-assembly (DSA) of poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) for higher resolution, placement accuracy and potentially improved pattern line edge roughness (LER), we have developed a next-generation material platform of organic high-\u03c7 block copolymers (\u201cHC series\u201d, AZEMBLYTM EXP PME-3000 series). The new material platform has a built-in orientation control mechanism which enables block copolymer domains to vertically selforient without topcoat/additive or delicate solvent vapor annealing. Furthermore, sub-10 nm lines and spaces (L/S) patterning by two major chemoepitaxy DSA, LiNe and SMARTTM processes, was successfully implemented on 12\u201d wafer substrates by using the PME-3000 lamellar series. The results revealed that the new material platform is compatible with the existing PS-b-PMMA-based chemical prepatterns and standard protocols. We also introduced the built-in orientation control strategy to the conventional PS-b-PMMA system, producing a new generation of PS-b-PMMA materials with facile orientation control. The modified PS-b-PMMA (m-PS-b-PMMA) performed LiNe flow DSA yielding a comparable CD process window with improved LER/LWR/SWR after the L/S patterns were transferred into a Si substrate.", "In this study, we have successfully synthesized polystyrene-b-poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (SH) with molecular weight of 14k and with narrow molecular weight distribution by living anionic polymerization, and the obtained SH diblock copolymer has formed the definite alternative lamellar structure with the half pitch of 10.4nm. In order to achieve narrow half pitch pattern, diblock copolymer (XY) with stronger segregated polymer components with high chi (X and Y) was used, and it was confirmed that the high-chi XY diblock copolymer having molecular weight of 6k showed the clear lamellar structure with the half pitch of 5.5nm. Furthermore syntheses of multiblock copolymers with high chi such as YXY (where X is Si contained polymer) triblock and XYXY (where XYXY is Si contained high \u03c7 polymer) tetrablock copolymers were attempted to achieve the narrower half pitch pattern less than 5 nm, and the multiblock copolymers with aimed molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution have been successfully obtained. From the highchi multiblock copolymers, it was confirmed that the formation of the definite microphase-separated structure with the half pitch of 4.8nm was observed by TEM and SAXS measurements. Moreover we have developed a large-scale living anionic polymerization apparatus for the preparation of well-defined block copolymers scaled over 3kg.", "In recent years, as next-generation lithography, various exposure techniques have been studied such as Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL), Directed Self Assembly (DSA) and multiple patterning processes. In particular, EUVL is the most promising candidate for the high volume manufacturing below N7 node. However, there are many problems to be solved such as materials, through put of the exposure tool and mask defect. With respect to the DSA, the fine patterning with block copolymer has been studied. But the DSA process also has the several problems such as the complicated process flow in chemo process, quality of the block copolymer and defect. On the other hand, although the multiple patterning has been applied the device manufacturing for several years, there are some problems such as significant increase in cost due to increasing of the process steps and the overlay accuracy at the multiple process steps. Therefore, Pattern Trimming Materials (PTM) and Pattern Shrink Materials (PSM) were developed for miniaturization using the current exposure technology. The PTM is applied on a resist pattern produced in a Positive Tone Development (PTD) process and trim the resist pattern. It is possible to control the trimming amount by changing the formulation and the baking process. It has been confirmed that the effectiveness of PTM is not only for the L/S pattern, but also for the 2D pattern like pillar pattern. At the same time, it is confirmed that the PTM can improve the Line Width Roughness (LWR) and Local Critical Dimension Uniformity (LCDU). On the other hand, the PSM is applied on the pattern prepared in a Negative Tone Imaging (NTI) process and then it can shrink the resist pattern after baking. We adopted the new concept for pattern shrinkage process which dramatically improved LCDU with the hole shrinkage. In this paper, we demonstrated the L/S and pillar pattern trimming by PTM and the C/H shrink by PSM with ArF immersion (ArF im) condition and EUV condition. In the future, PTM and PSM are expected to be applied in not only ArF im patterning process but also in EUVL.", "The application of phasefluid based intelligent fluids\u00ae in the field of photoresist stripping was studied. Due to their highly dynamic inner structure, phasefluids penetrate into the polymer network of photoresists and small gaps between resist layer and substrate and lift off the material from the surface. These non-aggressive stripping fluids were investigated regarding their efficiency in various resist stripping applications including initial results on copper metallization. Furthermore intelligent fluids\u00ae have been evaluated on an industry standard high volume single wafer cleaner. A baseline process on 300 mm wafers has been developed and characterized in terms of metallic and ionic impurities and defect level. Finally a general proof of concept for removal of positive tone resist from 300 mm silicon wafers is demonstrated.", "ArF lithography is still major process to develop N7/N5 devices. Especially in resist materials, DOF, roughness and CD uniformity are the biggest key parameters in fine pitches. To improve these issues, we newly propose to apply Dry Development Rinse Process (DDRP) and Materials (DDRM) as the ArF extension approach. In EUV lithography, DDRP is already one of the approaches to achieve high resolution. However, the performance of DDRP for ArF lithography was never demonstrated in detail. In this paper, we especially focus to improve DOF, CD uniformity and roughness by applying DDRP for ArF generation. Finally we succeeded to enhance every parameter at the same time by controlling DDRM etching condition. This new DDRP technology can be the promising approach for ArF extension stages in N7/N5 and beyond.", "The lithographic performance of photoresists is a function of the vertical distribution of formulation components, such as photoacid generator (PAG) molecules, in photoresist thin films and how these components undergo chemical modification and migrate within the film during the lithography processing steps. This paper will discuss how GCIB-SIMS depth profiles were used to monitor the PAG and quencher base distributions before and after exposure and post-exposure bake processing steps for different PAG/photoresist formulations. The authors show that the use of surface active quencher in an NTD photoresist leads to better resist profiles, superior DOF and better OPC performance.", "In the presented work solvent-free film preparation from molecular glass resists, the evaluation of the patterning performance using thermal scanning probe lithography (tSPL) and an efficient etch transfer process are demonstrated. As the presented materials have a high tendency to crystallize and thus form crystalline films of bad quality when processed by solution casting, two component mixtures prepared by coevaporation were investigated. Stable amorphous films were obtained by selecting compatible material pairs for the coevaporation. One optimized material pair is based on trissubstituted, twisted resist materials with a distinct difference in molecular design. Here a high resolution tSPL prepared pattern of 18 nm half pitch in a 10 nm thick film is demonstrated.\nA further optimization is reported for \u201csmall\u201d cubic silsequioxane molecules. Again single component films show independent to applied film preparation techniques bad film forming properties due to the high crystallinity of the symmetric cubic silsequioxane molecules. But coevaporation of the phenyl substituted octaphenylsilsequioxane combined with the fully aromatic 2,2',7,7'-tetraphenyl-9,9'-spirobi[fluorene] results in stable amorphous thin films. tSPL investigations demonstrate the patternability by writing high resolution line features of 20 nm half pitch. An important advantage of such a silicon rich resist material is that it can be directly converted to SiO2, yielding to a patterned hardmask of SiO2. This proof of principle is demonstrated and an efficient pattern transfer of 60 nm half pitch line into the underlying HM8006 is reported.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers has gained much attention for its potential as a low-cost, high-throughput patterning tool to supplement existing lithographic techniques, and in particular for its ability to easily pattern vertical interconnect accesses (VIAs).1 Single-hole shrink has been extensively explored, but the continued push towards higher-resolution patterns requires more efficient, less space-consuming approaches. The lithographic resolution limits the minimum distance between two features, and the single-hole templates take up valuable real estate on the wafer.2 To accommodate denser features and relax the resolution requirements of the lithographic techniques, it is prudent to move to multi-VIA configurations in which two or more features are assembled in a single guiding template (such as a peanut,3 or a rounded rectangle4). This allows considerably denser feature patterning, but comes at the cost of more plentiful and complicated defect modes than those found in single-hole shrink features. Most systems contain persistent horizontal structures (eg. rings, U-defects, or bars as shown in Figure 1) that prove detrimental to the etch process and yield undesirable configurations. Largely unexplored is the tandem use of chemoepitaxy and graphoepitaxy to suppress defect modes in multi- VIA templates. Specifically, chemically selective patterning of the substrate beneath a template could act synergistically with the template's lateral guidance to lower defectivity.\nIn this study, we use three-dimensional self-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulations to investigate the equilibrium and metastable defective configurations of di-block copolymer DSA systems in the presence of chemically selective or neutral template sidewalls and preferentially attractive striped substrates. We identify chemo-patterning schemes that maximize defect energies, including sidewall interaction strength and chemical preference. In addition, we discuss chemo-patterning schemes that backfire, creating even more complicated and persistent defect modes such as horizontal half-cylinders on the system substrate.", "Overcoming the optical limitations of 193nm immersion lithography can be achieved using Directed Self Assembly (DSA) of block-copolymers (BCPs) as a low-cost and versatile complementary technique. The goal of this paper is to investigate the potential of DSA to address line and space (L/S) high resolution patterning by performing the density multiplication of lines with the graphoepitaxy approach. As surface affinity is a key parameter in self-assembly, three variations, or \"flavors\", of DSA template affinity are investigated regarding several success criteria such as morphology control or defectivity. More precisely, both the methodology to register DSA defects and the impact of process parameters on defectivity are detailed. Using the 300mm pilot line available in LETI and Arkema\u2019s advanced materials, we investigate process optimization of DSA line/space patterning of a 38nm period lamellar PS-b-PMMA BCP (L38). For this study, our integration scheme, depicted in figure 2-1, is based on BCP self-assembly inside organic hard mask guiding patterns obtained using 193i nm lithography. Defect analysis coupled with the fine tuning of process parameters (annealing, brush material) provided the optimum conditions for the L38 self-assembly. Using such conditions, DSA using the three affinity flavors is investigated by means of SEM top-view and cross-section review. Lithographic performances of one selected flavor are then evaluated with the comparison of Process Windows (PWs) function of either commensurability, morphology or LWR. This work is a first step in finding the best process for an industrial graphoepitaxy approach.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) is considered a promising patterning approach for the 7 nm node and beyond. Specifically, a grapho-epitaxy process using a cylindrical phase BCP may offer an efficient solution for patterning randomly distributed contact holes with sub-resolution pitches, such as found in via and cut mask levels. In any grapho-epitaxy process, the pattern density impacts the template fill (local BCP thickness inside the template) and may cause defects due to respectively over- or underfilling of the template. In order to tackle this issue thoroughly, the parameters that determine template fill and the influence of template fill on the resulting pattern should be investigated. In this work, using three process flow variations (with different template surface energy), template fill is experimentally characterized as a function of pattern density and film thickness. The impact of these parameters on template fill is highly dependent on the process flow, and thus pre-pattern surface energy. Template fill has a considerable effect on the pattern transfer of the DSA contact holes into the underlying layer. Higher fill levels give rise to smaller contact holes and worse critical dimension uniformity. These results are important towards DSA-aware design and show that fill is a crucial parameter in grapho-epitaxy DSA.", "Spin-on-carbon hard mask (SOC HM) has been used in semiconductor manufacturing since 45nm node as an alternative carbon hard mask process to chemical vapor deposition (CVD). As advancement of semiconductor to 2X nm nodes and beyond, multiple patterning technology is used and planarization of topography become more important and challenging ever before. In order to develop next generation SOC, one of focuses is planarization of topography. SOC with different concepts for improved planarization and the influence of thermal flow temperature, crosslink, film shrinkage, baking conditions on planarization and filling performance are described in this paper.", "We describe a lithographic approach \u2013 Nanocrystal Plasma Polymerization (NPP)-based lithography (Figure 1) \u2013 where colloidal nanocrystal assemblies (CNAs) are used as the resist and, potentially, the active material. The patterning process is based on a change in the dispersibility of the CNAs in solvents as a result of the exposure to plasmas. Plasmas can etch the capping ligands from the exposed area. During the development step, the unexposed area of CNAs are redispersed leaving behind the patterned area.", "In this paper, we report the development of a new polyphenol, NF7177, applied to the Spin-On Carbon Hardmask and the thermosetting properties. The new polyphenol derivatives were easily synthesized by the condensation of aldehydes and dihydroxybiphenyl compounds. We found new polyphenol NF7177 was showed the good applicability to the raw material for the Spin-On Carbon Hardmask [1]. It was indicated that the heat resistance of NF7177 was due to cross-linking based on dehydration reaction. Furthermore the thermosetting properties seem to be depend on the number and position of OH group.", "Novolak resists have been widely used in IC production and are still used in the production of flat panel displays (FPDs) and MEMS. However, with the advent of high-definition products, FPDs increasingly face requirements for finer dimensions. These trends have generated requirements for higher sensitivity, higher resolution, and wider process margin for novolak resists. Using a lithography simulator with the goal of improving the performance of novolak resists, we examined various approaches to improving resist materials. This report discusses efforts to improve resolution and sensitivity using highly fractionated novolak resins and adding low molecular weight phenol resins.", "Metal oxide or metal nitride films are used as hard mask materials in semiconductor industry for patterning purposes due to their excellent etch resistances against the plasma etches. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques are usually used to deposit the metal containing materials on substrates or underlying films, which uses specialized equipment and can lead to high cost-of-ownership and low throughput. We have reported novel spin-on coatings that provide simple and cost effective method to generate metal oxide films possessing good etch selectivity and can be removed by chemical agents. In this paper, new spin-on Al oxide and Zr oxide hard mask formulations are reported. The new metal oxide formulations provide higher metal content compared to previously reported material of specific metal oxides under similar processing conditions. These metal oxide films demonstrate ultra-high etch selectivity and good pattern transfer capability. The cured films can be removed by various chemical agents such as developer, solvents or wet etchants/strippers commonly used in the fab environment. With high metal MHM material as an underlayer, the pattern transfer process is simplified by reducing the number of layers in the stack and the size of the nano structure is minimized by replacement of a thicker film ACL. Therefore, these novel AZ\u00ae spinon metal oxide hard mask materials can potentially be used to replace any CVD or ALD metal, metal oxide, metal nitride or spin-on silicon-containing hard mask films in 193 nm or EUV process.", "The main target of the current work was to develop new polymeric materials for lithographic applications, the main chain of which is cleaved under the influence of photogenerated acid. Acetals have been chosen as functional groups in the main polymer chain since they can be cleaved in the presence of an acid while they remain untouched in alkaline ambient. The synthesized polymers were designed to bear in addition suitable functional groups for the achievement of desirable lithographic characteristics (thermal stability, acceptable glass transition temperature, etch resistance, proper dissolution behaviour). The synthesis was carried out via polyaddition of a vinyloxyl compound and a diol compound to produce novel polymers with acetal repeating units in their backbone. We chose polyaromatic hydrocarbons as diol units to achieve increased etch resistance. In addition, the polyaromatic units allow exposure at 193 nm as well, where the absorption of simple aromatics is prohibitively high. Good solubility and increased surface adhesion were achieved by choosing cycloaliphatic vinyloxyl ethers as the second component for the polyaddition. In addition, the same route can be followed to incorporate chromophores that can tune the resist absorbance in different spectral regions. Furthermore, single component systems can be designed following this approach by the incorporation of suitable PAGs in the main chain.", "We explored the metal removal efficiency of Nylon 6,6 and HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) membrane based filters, in solvents of varying degree of polarity such as Cyclohexanone and 70:30 mixture of PGME (Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether) and PGMEA (Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether), In all the solvents tested, Nylon 6,6 membrane filtration was found to be significantly more effective in removing metals than HDPE membranes, regardless of their respective membrane pore sizes. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) mechanism was invoked to rationalize metal removal efficiency dependence on solvent hydrophobicity.", "This paper discusses the integration of nanosphere lithography (NSL) with other fabrication techniques, allowing for nano-scaled features to be realized within larger microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based devices. Nanosphere self-patterning methods have been researched for over three decades, but typically not for use as a lithography process. Only recently has progress been made towards integrating many of the best practices from these publications and determining a process that yields large areas of coverage, with repeatability and enabled a process for precise placement of nanospheres relative to other features. Discussed are two of the more common self-patterning methods used in NSL (i.e. spin-coating and dip coating) as well as a more recently conceived variation of dip coating. Recent work has suggested the repeatability of any method depends on a number of variables, so to better understand how these variables affect the process a series of test vessels were developed and fabricated. Commercially available 3-D printing technology was used to incrementally alter the test vessels allowing for each variable to be investigated individually. With these deposition vessels, NSL can now be used in conjunction with other fabrication steps to integrate features otherwise unattainable through current methods, within the overall fabrication process of larger MEMS devices. Patterned regions in 1800 series photoresist with a thickness of ~700nm are used to capture regions of self-assembled nanospheres. These regions are roughly 2-5 microns in width, and are able to control the placement of 500nm polystyrene spheres by controlling where monolayer self-assembly occurs. The resulting combination of photoresist and nanospheres can then be used with traditional deposition or etch methods to utilize these fine scale features in the overall design.", "We discuss edge placement errors (EPE) for multi-patterning of Mx critical layers using ArF lithography. Specific focus is placed on the block formation part of the process. While plenty of literature characterization data exist on spacer formation, only limited published data is available on block processes. We analyze the accuracy of placing blocks relative to narrow spacers. Many publications calculate EPE assuming Gaussian distributions for key process variations contributing to EPE. For practical reasons, each contributor is measured on dedicated test structures. In this work, we complement such analysis and directly measure the EPE in product. We perform high density sampling of blocks using CDSEM images and analyze all feature edges of interest. We find that block placement errors can be very different depending on their local design context. Specifically we report on 2 block populations (further called block A and B) which have a 4x different standard deviation. We attribute this to differences in local topography (spacer shape) and interaction with the plasma-etch process design. Block A (on top of the \u2018core space\u2019 S1) has excellent EPE uniformity of ~1 nm while block B (on top of \u2018gap space\u2019 S2) has degraded EPE control of ~4 nm. Finally, we suggest that the SOC etch process is at the origin on positioning blocks accurately on slim spacers, helping the manufacturability of spacer-based patterning techniques, and helping its extension toward the 5nm node.", "One of the practical candidates to produce 7nm node logic devices is to use the multiple patterning with 193-immersion exposure. For the multiple patterning, it is important to evaluate the relation between the number of mask layer and the minimum pitch systematically to judge the device manufacturability. Although the number of the time of patterning, namely LE(Litho-Etch) ^ x-time, and overlay steps have to be reduced, there are some challenges in miniaturization of hole size below 20nm. Various process fluctuations on contact hole have a direct impact on device performance. According to the technical trend, 12nm diameter hole on 30nm-pitch hole will be needed on 7nm node. Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) and Directed self-assembly (DSA) are attracting considerable attention to obtain small feature size pattern, however, 193-immersion still has the potential to extend optical lithography cost-effectively for sub-7nm node. The objective of this work is to study the process variation challenges and resolution in post-processing for the CD-bias control to meet sub-20nm diameter contact hole. Another pattern modulation is also demonstrated during post-processing step for hole shrink. With the realization that pattern fidelity and pattern placement management will limit scaling long before devices and interconnects fail to perform intrinsically, the talk will also outline how circle edge roughness (CER) and Local-CD uniformity can correct efficiency. On the other hand, 1D Gridded-Design-Rules layout (1D layout) has simple rectangular shapes. Also, we have demonstrated CD-bias modification on short trench pattern to cut grating line for its fabrication.", "As the critical dimension of devices is approaching the resolution limit of 193nm photo lithography, multiple patterning processes have been developed to print smaller CD and pitch. Multiple patterning and other advanced lithographic processes often require the formation of isolated features such as lines or posts by direct lithographic printing. The formation of isolated features with an acceptable process window, however, can pose a challenge as a result of poor aerial image contrast at defocus. Herein we report a novel Chemical Trimming Overcoat (CTO) as an extra step after lithography that allows us to achieve smaller feature size and better process window.", "Neutral layer (NL) material is one of the key materials for aligning block-co-polymer (BCP). In this study, NLs were designed and investigated, which have the capability to enhance the photo-lithography performance, a good alignment performance of BCP, and reduce the defectivity after chemo-epitaxy process. In order to enhance the photo-lithography performance, some new polymers were prepared with chromophores to control n/k value and adhesive unit interacted with the photo resist. The surface energy of these materials was adjusted to the neutral for BCP by controlling the ratio of chromophore and adhesion unit. The defects were also investigated and achieved low defectivity by optimized materials. Since this material has the above properties, it shows a good perpendicularly alignment pattern of BCP and a photolithography performance.", "Block copolymer self-assembly is a powerful tool for nanoscale patterning which benefits from predictive simulations. Two classes of simulations are self-consistent field theory (SCFT), which is accurate but computationally expensive, and phase field models, which are faster but historically less accurate. We refine a mapping procedure that uses results from SCFT to optimize parameters in a phase field model for diblock copolymers. We validate the performance of this optimized phase field model with regards to accuracy and computational speed in perfect and defective configurations. The optimized phase field model is significantly faster than SCFT and more accurate than previous phase field models, making it a viable design tool for directed self-assembly processes.", "In this paper, we presented the filtration effects on block copolymers (BCP) that are commonly used in directed self-assembly lithographic (DSAL) imaging schemes. Specifically we focused on filtration effects on micro-contaminants such as metal ions and metal induced gels.\nGel removal efficiency studies carried out with HDPE, Nylon and PTFE filters pointed out that Nylon 6,6 membrane is the most effective in removing gels in block copolymer (BCP) solutions.\nMetal removal efficiency studies were conducted using multistep filtrations such as repetitive filtration of single membrane material and combination of different type of membranes. Results showed that a combination of Nylon-6,6 and ion-exchange filters is highly effective in reducing metals such as Li, Mg and Al to > 99.99% efficiency. The mechanism of metal removal efficiency is discussed in detail.", "Block-copolymers (BCPs) offer the potential to meet the demands of next generation lithographic materials as they can self-assemble into scalable and tailorable nanometer scale patterns. In order for these materials to find wide spread adoption many challenges remain, including reproducible thin film morphology, for which the purity of block copolymers is critical. One of the sources of impurities are reaction conditions used to synthesize block copolymers that may result in the formation of homopolymer as a side product, which can impact the quality and the morphology of self-assembled features. Detection and characterization of these homopolymer impurities can be challenging by traditional methods of polymer characterization. We will discuss an alternate NMR-based method for the detection of homopolymer impurities in block copolymers \u2013 contrast enhanced diffusion ordered spectroscopy (CEDOSY). This experimental technique measures the diffusion coefficient of polymeric materials in the solution allowing for the \u2018virtual\u2019 or spectroscopic separation of BCPs that contain homopolymer impurities. Furthermore, the contrast between the diffusion coefficient of mixtures containing BCPs and homopolymer impurities can be enhanced by taking advantage of the chemical mismatch of the two blocks to effectively increase the size of the BCP (and diffusion coefficient) through the formation of micelles using a cosolvent, while the size and diffusion coefficient of homopolymer impurities remain unchanged. This enables the spectroscopic separation of even small amounts of homopolymer impurities that are similar in size to BCPs. Herein, we present the results using the CEDOSY technique with both first generation BCP system, poly(styrene)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate), as well as a second generation high-\u03c7 system.", "In this contribution, we present the results of a systematic material variation for the development of a resist material for high resolution positive tone electron beam lithography (EBL). Several acrylic copolymer materials with different compositions, that is varying mass fractions of the comonomers and different molecular weights, were synthesized and \u2013 as resist solutions \u2013 evaluated in terms of EBL performance at acceleration voltages of 30 kV and 100 kV. The resist material exhibiting the best combination of the desired properties, named mr-PosEBR, is two times more sensitive than PMMA 495k and performs comparably to the known high resolution resist ZEP520A at 30 kV. For example, a grating pattern with 29 nm wide lines with a period of 100 nm could be lithographically generated in films of mr-PosEBR with an area dose of 100 \u03bcC/cm2. In terms of resolution, single lines of only 35 nm width could be fabricated via metal liftoff. Furthermore, the dry etch stability of mr-PosEBR in a CF4/SF6 process is similar to the one of ZEP520A. Consequently, via dry etching nano patterns in mr-PosEBR could be smoothly transferred into the underlying Si substrate with high fidelity. Moreover, mr-PosEBR was evaluated as electron beam grayscale patterning and reflow resist. It was shown that the resist exhibits a good grayscale and reflow performance very similar to PMMA 120k and ZEP520A. Via these well controllable processes the generation of a wide variety of features and applications is possible.", "We have developed a range of fullerene containing materials for use as organic hard masks. Recent advances in material development are reported together with some results from external evaluations of the original HM100 series. Initial results for the new HM340-383-010 formulation show it to have a high thermal stability (~5.5 % mass loss at 400\u00b0C) and a very high carbon content (at 95.3%), offering high etch durability.", "Helium ion beam lithography (HIBL) is a novel alternative lithographic technique with the capacity of fabricating highresolution and high-density features. Only limited research has been performed exploring HIBL to date. HafSOx (Hf(OH)4\u20132x\u22122y(O2)x(SO4)y\u00b7qH2O) is a negative-tone inorganic resist that is one of several candidate resist materials for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) and e-beam lithography (EBL), and has been demonstrated to show high resolution, moderate sensitivity and low line-edge roughness (LER) in both EUVL and EBL. To date, no ion beam lithography work on HafSOx has been reported. In this study, we tested HafSOx as an HIBL resist and achieved a high sensitivity compared with EBL with a turn-on dose D100 ~ 2-4 \u03bcC/cm2. We obtained sub-10 nm line widths with low LER. A simple Monte Carlo simulation suggests that ionizing excitation accounts for most of the incident He ions\u2019 energy loss.", "The validity of our approach of inedible cellulose-based resist material derived from woody biomass has been confirmed experimentally for the use of pure water in organic solvent-free water spin-coating and tetramethylammonium hydroxide(TMAH)-free water-developable techniques of eco-conscious electron beam (EB) and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. The water developable, non-chemically amplified, high sensitive, and negative tone resist material in EB and EUV lithography was developed for environmental affair, safety, easiness of handling, and health of the working people. The inedible cellulose-based biomass resist material was developed by replacing the hydroxyl groups in the beta-linked disaccharides with EB and EUV sensitive groups. The 50-100 nm line and space width, and little footing profiles of cellulose-based biomass resist material on hardmask and layer were resolved at the doses of 10-30 \u03bcC/cm2. The eco-conscious lithography techniques was referred to as green EB and EUV lithography using inedible cellulose-based biomass resist material.", "In the past 10 years, immersion lithography has been the most effective high volume manufacturing method for the critical layers of semiconductor devices. Thinking of the next 10 years, we can expect continuous improvement on existing 300 mm wafer scanners with better accuracy and throughput to enhance the total output value per input cost. This value productivity, however, can be upgraded also by larger innovations which might happen in optical lithography. In this paper, we will discuss the possibilities and the impossibilities of potential innovation ideas of optical lithography, which are 450 mm wafer, optical maskless, multicolor lithography, and metamaterial.", "Since the 28nm node, the resolution of ArFi lithography tools has been limited by the fixed Numerical Aperture of the scanners (1.35) at approximately 40-45 nm half-pitch. As a consequence, the shrink cadence identified by Moore\u2019s law requires more complex patterning flows such as multiple Litho-Etch (LE) steps as well as spacer techniques (Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP)). To ensure yield it is necessary to optimize the total Edge Placement Error, a combination of Overlay, Global CDU, LCDU, OPC and other process and equipment errors.\nIn this presentation I will discuss some of the ways that these contributors can be measured, modeled and corrected as part of a Holistic Lithography methodology. Multiple-patterning techniques can be combined with EUV lithography to continue Moore\u2019s law down to final pattern dimensions of 5-6 nm half pitch.", "In this paper, we discuss the lithographic qualification of high transmission (High T) mask for Via and contact hole applications in 10nm node and beyond. First, the simulated MEEF and depth of focus (DoF) data are compared between the 6% and High T attnPSM masks with the transmission of High T mask blank varying from 12% to 20%. The 12% High T blank shows significantly better MEEF and larger DoF than those of 6% attnPSM mask blank, which are consistent with our wafer data. However, the simulations show no obvious advantage in MEEF and DoF when the blank transmittance is larger than 12%. From our wafer data, it has been seen that the common process window from High T mask is 40nm bigger than that from the 6% attnPSM mask. In the elongated bar structure with smaller aspect ratio, 1.26, the 12% High T mask shows significantly less develop CD pull back in the major direction. Compared to the High T mask, the optimized new illumination condition for 6% attnPSM shows limited improvement in MEEF and the DoF through pitch. In addition, by using the High T mask blank, we have also investigated the SRAF printing, side lobe printing and the resist profile through cross sections, and no patterning risk has been found for manufacturing. As part of this work new 12% High T mask blank materials and processes were developed, and a brief overview of key mask technology development results have been shared. Overall, it is concluded that the High T mask, 12% transmission, provides the most robust and extendable lithographic solution for 10nm node and beyond.", "With shrinking design rules, the overall patterning requirements are getting aggressively tighter. For the 7-nm node and below, allowable CD uniformity variations are entering the Angstrom region (ref [1]). Optimizing inter- and intra-field CD uniformity of the final pattern requires a holistic tuning of all process steps. In previous work, CD control with either litho cluster or etch tool corrections has been discussed. Today, we present a holistic CD control approach, combining the correction capability of the etch tool with the correction capability of the exposure tool. The study is done on 10-nm logic node wafers, processed with a test vehicle stack patterning sequence. We include wafer-to-wafer and lot-to-lot variation and apply optical scatterometry to characterize the fingerprints. Making use of all available correction capabilities (lithography and etch), we investigated single application of exposure tool corrections and of etch tool corrections as well as combinations of both to reach the lowest CD uniformity. Results of the final pattern uniformity based on single and combined corrections are shown. We conclude on the application of this holistic lithography and etch optimization to 7nm High-Volume manufacturing, paving the way to ultimate within-wafer CD uniformity control.", "Patterning solutions based on ArF immersion lithography are the fundamental enablers of device scaling. In order to meet the challenges of industry technology roadmaps, tool makers in the DUV lithography area are continuously investigating all of the interactions between equipment parameters and patterning in order to identify potential margins of improvement. Cymer, a light source manufacturer, is fully involved and is playing a crucial role in these investigations. As demonstrated by recent studies[1], a significant improvement to multiple patterning solutions can be achieved by leveraging light source capabilities. In particular, bandwidth is a key knob that can be leveraged to improve patterning. While previous publications[1,2] assessed contrast loss induced by increased bandwidth, this work will expand the research in the opposite direction and will investigate how patterning can be affected by improved image contrast achieved through a reduction in bandwidth. The impact of lower bandwidth is assessed using experimental and simulation studies and provide persuasive results which suggest continued studies in this area.", "As overlay margin is getting tighter, traditional overlay correction method is not enough to secure more overlay margin without extended correction potential on lithography tool. Timely, the lithography tool has a capability of wafer to wafer correction. From these well-timed industry\u2019s preparations, the uncorrected overlay error from current sampling in a lot could be corrected for yield enhancement.\nIn this paper, overlay budget break was performed prior to experiments with the purpose of estimating amount of overlay improvement. And wafer to wafer correction was simulated to the specified layer of a 2x node DRAM device. As a result, not only maximum 94.4% of residual variation improvement is estimated, but also recognized that more samplings to cover all wafer\u2019s behavior is inevitable. Integrated metrology with optimized sampling scheme was also introduced as a supportive method for more samplings.", "In order to optimize yield in DRAM semiconductor manufacturing for 2x nodes and beyond, the (processing induced) overlay fingerprint towards the edge of the wafer needs to be reduced. Traditionally, this is achieved by acquiring denser overlay metrology at the edge of the wafer, to feed field-by-field corrections. Although field-by-field corrections can be effective in reducing localized overlay errors, the requirement for dense metrology to determine the corrections can become a limiting factor due to a significant increase of metrology time and cost. In this study, a more cost-effective solution has been found in extending the regular correction model with an edge-specific component. This new overlay correction model can be driven by an optimized, sparser sampling especially at the wafer edge area, and also allows for a reduction of noise propagation. Lithography correction potential has been maximized, with significantly less metrology needs. Evaluations have been performed, demonstrating the benefit of edge models in terms of on-product overlay performance, as well as cell based overlay performance based on metrology-to-cell matching improvements. Performance can be increased compared to POR modeling and sampling, which can contribute to (overlay based) yield improvement. Based on advanced modeling including edge components, metrology requirements have been optimized, enabling integrated metrology which drives down overall metrology fab footprint and lithography cycle time.", "Overlay is one of the key factors which enables optical lithography extension to 1X node DRAM manufacturing. It is natural that accurate wafer alignment is a prerequisite for good device overlay. However, alignment failures or misalignments are commonly observed in a fab. There are many factors which could induce alignment problems. Low alignment signal contrast is one of the main issues. Alignment signal contrast can be degraded by opaque stack materials or by alignment mark degradation due to processes like CMP. This issue can be compounded by mark sub-segmentation from design rules in combination with double or quadruple spacer process. Alignment signal contrast can be improved by applying new material or process optimization, which sometimes lead to the addition of another process-step with higher costs. If we can amplify the signal components containing the position information and reduce other unwanted signal and background contributions then we can improve alignment performance without process change. In this paper we use ASML's new alignment sensor (as was introduced and released on the NXT:1980Di) and sample wafers with special stacks which can induce poor alignment signal to demonstrate alignment and overlay improvement.", "Demand for ever increasing level of microelectronics integration continues unabated, driving the reduction of the integrated circuit critical dimensions, and escalating requirements for image overlay and pattern dimension control. The challenges to meet these demands are compounded by requirement that pattern edge placement errors be at single nanometer levels. Layout design together with the patterning tools performance play key roles in determining location of the pattern edges at different device layers. However, complexities of the layout design often lead to stringent tradeoffs for viable optical proximity correction and imaging strategy solutions. As a result, in addition to scanner overlay performance, pattern imaging plays a key role in the pattern edge placement. The imaging contributes to edge displacement by impacting the image dimensions and by shifting the images relative to their target locations. In this report we discuss various aspects of advanced image control at 10 nm integrated circuit design rules. We analyze the impact of pattern design and scanner performance on pattern edges. We present an example of complex, three step litho-etch patterning involving immersion scanners. We draw conclusion on edge placement control when complex images interact with wafer topography.", "As technology node has been shrinking for bit growth, various technologies have been developed for high productivity. Nevertheless, lithography technology is close to its limit. In order to overcome these limits, EUV(Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) and DSA(Directed Self-Assembly) are being developed, but there still exists problems for mass production. Currently, all lithography technology developments focus on solving the problems related to fine patterning and widening process window.\nOne of the technologies is NTD(Negative Tone Development) which uses inverse development compared to PTD(Positive Tone Development). The exposed area is eliminated by positive developer in PTD, whereas the exposed area is remained in NTD. It is well known that NTD has better characteristics compared to PTD in terms of DOF(Depth of Focus) margin, MEEF(Mask Error Enhancement Factor), and LER(Line End Roughness) for both small contact holes and isolated spaces [1]. Contact hole patterning is especially more difficult than space patterning because of the lower image contrast and smaller process window [2]. Thus, we have focused on the trend of both NTD and PTD contact hole patterns in various environments. We have analyzed optical performance of both NTD and PTD according to size and pitch by SMO(Source Mask Optimization) software. Moreover, the simulation result of NTD process was compared with the NTD wafer level performance and the process window variation of NTD was characterized through both results. This result will be a good guideline to avoid DoF loss when using NTD process for contact layers with various contact types.\nIn this paper, we studied the impact of different sources on various combinations of pattern sizes and pitches while estimating DOF trends aside from source and pattern types.", "The printing of contact holes using positive tone development typically requires the interference of more than the 0th and 1st diffracted orders. In the 2d case and cQuad illumination in a positive tone process, if (0,0), (\u00b11,0), and (0,\u00b11) are exclusively present, the relevant contrast for imaging can in the best case not rise above 0.33, which is typically insufficient for a good process window. And this maximum value can only be achieved if the (0,0) and (\u00b11,0) orders are matched to give a perfect sine wave of perfect contrast in y while the (0,0) and (0,\u00b11) orders yield perfect contrast in x. In reality, the contrast is quite a bit lower. On the other hand, for negative tone development we are interested in the minima of the intensity\u2013the dark locations in the image\u2013and if we can manage to reduce the intensity in the minima we can achieve a high contrast image. Through a choice of RET and illumination, we manage to achieve a resolution for contact holes in 2d at k1 values that can otherwise be achieved only for 1d imaging.\nEarlier work has been done on double exposures that exposed in the same resist a horizontal grating with x-dipoles and subsequently a vertical grating with y dipoles, without intermediate process steps. This yielded a high contrast image in resist at k1 <0.3.1 We show that an equivalent result can be achieved in a single exposure with a single mask, at admittedly high dose. We investigate the process parameters and the related mask tolerances, and find a non-intuitive result for the mask pattern that yields an optimized image at given mask specifications. Finally, we investigate the extension of this technique to EUV through simulations and experiments.", "With shrinking feature size, runtime has become a limitation of model-based OPC (MB-OPC). A few machine learning-guided OPC (ML-OPC) have been studied as candidates for next-generation OPC, but they all employ too many parameters (e.g. local densities), which set their own limitations. We propose to use basis functions of polar Fourier transform (PFT) as parameters of ML-OPC. Since PFT functions are orthogonal each other and well reflect light phenomena, the number of parameters can significantly be reduced without loss of OPC accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our new ML-OPC achieves 80% reduction in OPC time and 35% reduction in the error of predicted mask bias when compared to conventional ML-OPC.", "The use of optical proximity correction (OPC) demands increasingly accurate models of the photolithographic process. Model building and inference techniques in the data science community have seen great strides in the past two decades which make better use of available information. This paper aims to demonstrate the predictive power of Bayesian inference as a method for parameter selection in lithographic models by quantifying the uncertainty associated with model inputs and wafer data. Specifically, the method combines the model builder's prior information about each modelling assumption with the maximization of each observation's likelihood as a Student's t-distributed random variable. Through the use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, a model's parameter space is explored to find the most credible parameter values. During parameter exploration, the parameters' posterior distributions are generated by applying Bayes' rule, using a likelihood function and the a priori knowledge supplied. The MCMC algorithm used, an affine invariant ensemble sampler (AIES), is implemented by initializing many walkers which semiindependently explore the space. The convergence of these walkers to global maxima of the likelihood volume determine the parameter values' highest density intervals (HDI) to reveal champion models. We show that this method of parameter selection provides insights into the data that traditional methods do not and outline continued experiments to vet the method.", "Optimization of OPC recipes is not trivial due to multiple parameters that need tuning and their correlation. Usually, no standard methodologies exist for choosing the initial recipe settings, and in the keyword development phase, parameters are chosen either based on previous learning, vendor recommendations, or to resolve specific problems on particular special constructs. Such approaches fail to holistically quantify the effects of parameters on other or possible new designs, and to an extent are based on the keyword developer\u2019s intuition. In addition, when a quick fix is needed for a new design, numerous customization statements are added to the recipe, which make it more complex.\nThe present work demonstrates the application of Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique for optimizing OPC recipes. GA is a search technique that mimics Darwinian natural selection and has applications in various science and engineering disciplines. In this case, GA search heuristic is applied to two problems: (a) an overall OPC recipe optimization with respect to selected parameters and, (b) application of GA to improve printing and via coverage at line end geometries. As will be demonstrated, the optimized recipe significantly reduced the number of ORC violations for case (a). For case (b) line end for various features showed significant printing and filling improvement.", "Over the years, Lithography Engineers continue to focus on CD control, overlay and process capability to meet current node requirements for yield and device performance. Reducing or eliminating variability in any process will have significant impact, but the sources of variability in any lithography process are many. The goal from the light source manufacturer is to further enable capability and reduce variation through a number of parameters. (1, 2, 3, 4)\nRecent improvements in bandwidth control have been realized in the XLR platform with Cymer\u2019s DynaPulseTM control technology. This reduction in bandwidth variation translates in the further reduction of CD variation in device structures 5,6. The Authors will review the methodology for determining the impact that bandwidth variation has on CD dose, focus, pitch and bandwidth, which is required to build a dynamic model. This assists in understanding the impact that bandwidth variability has on the accuracy of the Source and Mask optimization and the overall OPC model, which is reviewed and demonstrated.", "The introduction of DSA for lithography is still obstructed by a number of technical issues including the lack of a comprehensive computational platform. This work presents a direct source/mask/DSA optimization (SMDSAO) method, which incorporates standard lithographic metrics and figures of merit such as the maximization of process windows. The procedure is demonstrated for a contact doubling example, assuming grapho-epitaxy-DSA. To retain a feasible runtime, a geometry-based Interface Hamiltonian DSA model is employed. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated through several results and their comparison with more rigorous DSA models.", "Self-Aligned Via (SAV) process is commonly used in back end of line (BEOL) patterning. As the technology node advances, tightening CD and overlay specs require continuous improvement in model accuracy of the SAV process. Traditional single layer Variable Etch Bias (VEB) model is capable of describing the micro-loading and aperture effects associated with the reactive ion etch (RIE), but it does not include effects from under layers. For the SAV etch, a multi-layer VEB model is needed to account for the etch restriction from metal trenches. In this study, we characterize via post-etch dimensions through pitch and through metal trench widths, and show that VEB model prediction accuracy for SAV CDs after SAV formation can be significantly improved by applying a multi-layer scheme. Using a multi-layer VEB, it is demonstrated that the output via size changes with varying trench dimensions, which matches the silicon results. The model also reports via shape post-etch as a function of trench environment, where elliptical vias are correctly produced. The multi-layer VEB model can be applied both multi-layer correction and verification in full chip flow. This paper will also suggest that the multi-layer VEB model can be used in other FEOL layers with interlayer etch process effects, such as gate cut, to support the robustness of new model.", "The Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) process is one of the most suitable techniques for the patterning of under-20 nm half-pitch lines and spaces (L/S) patterns because it requires only one lithography step, resulting in a relatively low process cost. A serious problem when applying the SAQP process to real devices is the printability of defects in the photomask to the wafer because the effect of the mask defects may be enlarged when the defects are transferred to the spacer pattern. In this study, we evaluate the mask defect printability for both opaque and clear defects in the SAQP process in order to clarify the limit size of the defects on the photomask and to clarify whether the acceptable mask defect size given by ITRS was too small. The defect sizes of both the opaque and clear defects were relaxed as the wafer process progressed from lithography to SAQP. The acceptable mask defect size in the SAQP process found to be 70 nm, which is relaxed from that in ITRS2013.", "Standard cell pin access has become one of the most challenging issues for the back-end physical design in sub-14nm technology nodes due to increased pin density, limited number of routing tracks, and complex DFM rules/constraints from multiple patterning lithography. The standard cell I/O pin access problem is very difficult also because the access points of each pin are limited and they interfere with each other. There have been several studies across various standard cell and physical design stages, including standard cell pin access optimization, placement mitigation and routing planning, to achieve overall pin access optimization. In this paper, we will introduce a holistic approach across different design stages to deal with the pin access issue while accommodating the complex DFM constraints in advanced lithography.", "The lithographic performance of a photomask is sensitive to shape uncertainty caused by manufacturing and measurement errors. This work proposes incorporating the photomask shape uncertainty in computational lithography such as inverse lithography. The shape uncertainty of the photomask is quantitatively modeled as a random \ufb01eld in a level-set method framework. With this, the shape uncertainty can be characterized by several parameters, making it computationally tractable to be incorporated in inverse lithography technique (ILT). Simulations are conducted to show the e\ufb00ectiveness of using this method to represent various kinds of shape variations. It is also demonstrated that incorporating the shape variation in ILT can reduce the mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) values of the optimized patterns, and improve the robustness of imaging performance against mask shape \ufb02uctuation.", "Modern optical applications have special demands on the lithographic fabrication technologies. This relates to the lateral shape of the structures as well as to their three dimensional surface profile. On the other hand optical nano-structures are often periodic which allows for the use of dedicated lithographic exposure principles. The paper briefly reviews actual developments in the field of optical nano-structure generation. Special emphasis will be given to two technologies: electron-beam lithography based on a flexible cell-projection method and the actual developments in diffractive mask aligner lithography. Both offer a cost effective fabrication alternative for high resolution structures or three-dimensional optical surface profiles.", "We developed a novel LED projection based direct write grayscale lithography system for the generation of optical surface profiles such as micro-lenses, diffractive elements, diffusors, and micro freeforms. The image formation is realized by a LCoS micro-display which is illuminated by a 405 nm UV High Power LED. The image on the display can be demagnified from factors 5x to 100x with an exchangeable lens. By controlling exposure time and LED power, the presented technique enables a highly dynamic dosage control for the exposure of h-line sensitive photo resist. In addition, the LCoS micro-display allows for an intensity control within the micro-image which is particularly advantageous to eliminate surface profile errors from stitching and limited homogeneity from LED illumination. Together with an accurate calibration of the resist response this leads to a superior low surface error of realized profiles below <0.2% RMS. The micro-display is mounted on a 3-axis (XY\u03b8) stage for precise alignment. The substrate is brought into position with an air bearing stage which addresses an area of 500 \u00d7 500 mm2 with a positioning accuracy of <100 nm. As the exposure setup performs controlled motion in the z-direction the system to maintain the focal distance and lithographic patterning on non-planar surfaces to some extent. The exposure concept allows a high structure depth of more than 100 \u03bcm and a spatial resolution below 1 \u03bcm as well as the possibility of very steep sidewalls with angles larger than >80\u00b0. Another benefit of the approach is a patterning speed up to 100 cm2/h, which allows fabricating large-scale optics and microstructures in an acceptable time. We present the setup and show examples of micro-structures to demonstrate the performance of the system, namely a refractive freeform array, where the RMS surface deviation does not exceed 0.2% of the total structure depth of 75 \u03bcm. Furthermore, we show that this exposure tool is suitable to generate diffractive optical elements as well as freeform optics and arrays with a high aspect ratio and structure depth showing a superior optical performance. Lastly we demonstrate a multi-level diffraction grating on a curved substrate.", "This paper introduces Firefly, an optical lithography origination system that has been developed to produce holographic masters of high quality. This mask-less lithography system has a resolution of 418 nm half-pitch, and generates holographic masters with the optical characteristics required for security applications of level 1 (visual verification), level 2 (pocket reader verification) and level 3 (forensic verification). The holographic master constitutes the main core of the manufacturing process of security holographic labels used for the authentication of products and documents worldwide. Additionally, the Firefly is equipped with a software tool that allows for the hologram design from graphic formats stored in bitmaps. The software is capable of generating and configuring basic optical effects such as animation and color, as well as effects of high complexity such as Fresnel lenses, engraves and encrypted images, among others. The Firefly technology gathers together optical lithography, digital image processing and the most advanced control systems, making possible a competitive equipment that challenges the best technologies in the industry of holographic generation around the world. In this paper, a general description of the origination system is provided as well as some examples of its capabilities.", "Shaping of light behind masks using different techniques is the milestone of the printing industry. The aerial image distribution or the intensity distribution at the printing distances defines the resolution of the structure after printing. Contrast and phase are the two parameters that play a major role in shaping of light to get the desired intensity pattern. Here, in contrast to many other contributions that focus on intensity, we discuss the phase evolution for different structures. The amplitude or intensity characteristics of the structures in a binary mask at different proximity gaps have been analyzed extensively for many industrial applications. But the phase evolution from the binary mask having OPC structures is not considered so far. The mask we consider here is the normal amplitude binary mask but having high resolution Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) structures for corners. The corner structures represent a two dimensional problem which is difficult to handle with simple rules of phase masks design and therefore of particular interest. The evolution of light from small amplitude structures might lead to high contrast by creating sharp phase changes or phase singularities which are points of zero intensity. We show the phase modulation at different proximity gaps and can visualize the shaping of light according to the phase changes. The analysis is done with an instrument called High Resolution Interference Microscopy (HRIM), a Mach-Zehnder interferometer that gives access to three-dimensional phase and amplitude images. The current paper emphasizes on the phase measurement of different optical proximity correction structures, and especially on corners of a binary mask.", "Prime silicon wafers are ideal substrates for lithographic patterning, with tight flatness specifications for focus control. Process engineers are painfully aware that in-process product wafers can substantially depart from this ideal substrate. Wafer processing can induce non-flatness leading to focus problems, or distort the wafer leading to overlay issues. Thus processes from outside the lithography sector can impact yield by ruining lithographic pattern quality. Double-sided optical interferometric metrology is the standard method to assess the flatness of blank silicon wafers. In the last several years, a similar Patterned Wafer Geometry (PWG) metrology tool is able to measure in-process patterned wafers. The apparent surface seen by an interferometer may be different than the true surface due to transparent thin films, a discrepancy that we call \"false topography\". Modeling results will demonstrate the use of a thin opaque film to reduce the problem. PWG metrology offers compelling advantages for the practical investigation of process-induced focus and overlay problems. The paper will include several examples of process learning from PWG metrology.", "Adjustment and control of the illumination pupil asymmetry is relevant for wafer alignment and overlay of lithography tools. Pupil asymmetries can cause a tilt in aerial image (Aerial Image Tilt, or AIT). This AIT, combined with a focus offset, leads to a horizontal image shift. Pupil asymmetries can be related to a shift of the entire illumination pupil (geometrical telecentricity) caused by illuminator misalign. Another type of pupil asymmetry is energetic imbalance (quantified by pupil Center of Gravity, COG). The scanner can show pupil variation across the exposure slit.\nIn general the COG at the edge of the slit is often worse than in the center part of the slit. Recently, ASML has released the NXT:1980Di that is equipped with an enhanced illuminator to improve pupil COG variation across the slit. In this paper we explore the performance of this scanner system and show that the AIT variation across the slit is also reduced significantly.", "High throughput with high resolution imaging has been key to the development of leading-edge microlithography. However, management of thermal aberrations due to lens heating during exposure has become critical for simultaneous achievement of high throughput and high resolution. Thermal aberrations cause CD drift and overlay error, and these errors lead directly to edge placement errors (EPE). Management and control of high order thermal aberrations is a critical requirement. In this paper, we will show practical performance of the lens heating with dipole and other typical illumination conditions for finer patterning. We confirm that our new control system can reduce the high-order aberrations and enable critical-dimension uniformity CDU during the exposure.", "Multiple patterning ArF immersion lithography has been expected as the promising technology to satisfy tighter leading edge device requirements. One of the most important features of the next generation lasers will be the ability to support green operations while further improving cost of ownership and performance. Especially, the dependence on rare gases, such as Neon and Helium, is becoming a critical issue for high volume manufacturing process.\nThe new ArF excimer laser, GT64A has been developed to cope with the reduction of operational costs, the prevention against rare resource shortage and the improvement of device yield in multiple-patterning lithography. GT64A has advantages in efficiency and stability based on the field-proven injection-lock twin-chamber platform (GigaTwin platform). By the combination of GigaTwin platform and the advanced gas control algorithm, the consumption of rare gases such as Neon is reduced to a half. And newly designed Line Narrowing Module can realize completely Helium free operation. For the device yield improvement, spectral bandwidth stability is important to increase image contrast and contribute to the further reduction of CD variation. The new spectral bandwidth control algorithm and high response actuator has been developed to compensate the offset due to thermal change during the interval such as the period of wafer exchange operation. And REDeeM Cloud\u2122, new monitoring system for managing light source performance and operations, is on-board and provides detailed light source information such as wavelength, energy, E95, etc.", "Immersion scanners remain the critical lithography workhorses in semiconductor device manufacturing. When progressing towards the 7nm device node for logic and D18 device node for DRAM production, pattern-placement and layer-to-layer overlay requirements keep progressively scaling down and consequently require system improvements in immersion scanners. The on-product-overlay requirements are approaching levels of only a few nanometers, imposing stringent requirements on the scanner tool design in terms of reproducibility, accuracy and stability.\nIn this paper we report on the performance of the NXT:1980Di immersion scanner. The NXT:1980Di builds upon the NXT:1970Ci, that is widely used for 16nm, 14nm and 10nm high-volume manufacturing. We will discuss the NXT:1980Di system- and sub-system/module enhancements that drive the scanner overlay, focus and productivity performance. Overlay, imaging, focus, productivity and defectivity data will be presented for multiple tools.\nTo further reduce the on-product overlay system performance, alignment sensor contrast improvements as well as active reticle temperature conditioning are implemented on the NXT:1980Di. Reticle temperature conditioning will reduce reticle heating overlay and the higher contrast alignment sensor will improve alignment robustness for processed alignment targets.\nDue to an increased usage of multiple patterning techniques, an increased number of immersion exposures is required. NXT:1980Di scanner design modifications raised productivity levels from 250wph to 275wph. This productivity enhancement provides lower cost of ownership (CoO) for customers using immersion technology.", "The semiconductor technology roadmap suggests that multiple patterning techniques will be used at the 7nm node. The final lithography accuracy is determined by what is known as the \"on-product\" performance, which includes projection lens heating, illumination condition variations, product wafer related errors, and long term stability. It is evident that on product performance improvement is imperative now, and will become even more crucial in coming years. Nikon has developed the next-generation lithography system focusing on optimizing the main factors impacting on product performance. In this paper, we will introduce the details of the next-generation Nikon scanner and provide supporting performance data.", "As feature size shrinks, better critical dimension uniformity (CDU) is highly demanded in aspects of device characteristics. Intra field CDU is one of main contributor in total CD variation budget. Especially systematic CD distribution in shot, bank and MAT boundary should be strongly considered to minimize repeated error to guarantee high yield even though it is not prominent in overall CDU value.\nIn this paper, we investigated the several factors to affect systematic CD distribution error on intra field. First of all, localized mask CD variation caused by electron-beam scattering over local region, development loading and etch loading effect directly printed in wafer. Appropriate mask fabrication suppress CD variation at boundary region. Secondly, chemical flare effect is expected to make CD gradient at boundary region. Photo acid concentration change by sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF) can reduce the CD gradient. We demonstrated SRAF size dependency in positive tone develop (PTD) and negative tone develop (NTD) case. Thirdly, out-of-field stray light (OOFSL) due to adjacent exposed field causes CD gradient at field boundary. Exposure dose reduction is expected as a solution in this case. Even though we perfectly control CDU at boundary region after mask patterning, other process issues such as etch and CMP loading effect also make worse the CD distribution at boundary region.\nThrough the consideration of above factors, we optimized systematic CD distribution error at boundary region before etch. Furthermore we compared several techniques to compensate post-etch systematic CD distribution.", "Diffractive mask-aligner lithography allows printing sub-micrometer resolution structures by using non-contact mode. For such a purpose, binary diffraction gratings are used as masks and are designed to transmit solely the \u00b11st diffraction orders. The high resolution interferogram is realized by the overlapping and the interference of the propagating beams. By applying the techniques known as Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP), it\u00b4s possible to decrease the period of the fabricated grating (350 nm) by a factor of two, and thus reaching the 90nm structure width. As application, metallic gratings have been fabricated operating as wire grid polarizer (WGP).", "In this paper we present a method to optimize the lithography process for the fabrication of interdigitated electrode arrays (IDA) for a lift-off free electrochemical biosensor. The biosensor is based on amperometric method to allow a signal amplification by redox cycling. We already demonstrated a method to fabricate IDAs with nano gaps with conventional mask aligner lithography and two subsequent deposition processes. By decreasing the distance down to the nanometer range the linewidth variation is becoming the most critical factor and can result in a short circuit of the electrodes. Therefore, the light propagation and the resist pattern of the mask aligner lithography process are simulated to optimize the lithography process. To optimize the outer finger structure assistant features (AsFe) were introduced. The AsFe allow an optimization of the intensity distribution at the electrode fingers. Hence, the periodicity is expanded and the outer structure of the IDA is practically a part of the periodic array. The better CD uniformity can be obtained by adding three assistant features which generate an equal intensity distributions for the complete finger pattern. Considering a mask optimization of the outer structures would also be feasible. However, due to the strong impact of the gap between mask and wafer at contact lithography it is not practicable. The better choice is to create the same intensity distribution for all finger structures. With the introduction of the assistant features large areas with electrode gap sizes in the sub 100 nm region are demonstrated.", "In proximity lithography, interference and diffraction effects arise when printing small features because of the proximity gap. Different techniques are used in order to control and take advantage of these effects. In this paper, the focus is set on the MO Exposure Optics developed to shape the angular spectrum of the exposure light. The MO Exposure Optics contains several elements including microlens arrays that have certain symmetry and sampling. The MO Exposure Optics allows to set the angle of illumination and can be used to define spatial coherence. We study here in detail the influence of different illumination settings on optical proximity correction (OPC) structures. We apply this concept for the first time to a LED illumination. The propagation of light after an optical proximity correction structure is measured by recording aerial images over a distance of up to 60 \u03bcm behind the mask with a high resolution microscope setup.1 As an example structure, we investigate here an optical proximity correction structure that is intended to make the edge of a line sharper. Using illumination filter plates that limit the angle of illumination and increase the coherence lead to pronounced interference effects in aerial images as expected. But special settings of the illumination allow to achieve comparable results with much larger illumination angles and higher throughput. We will show examples and analyze the results", "Laser interference lithography (LIL) is a great way to produce micro and nano scale periodic structures. The principle of LIL is that two or more coherent laser beams overlap with each other and form a standing wave in the space which can be recorded by the photoresist. However, due to the principle of LIL, exposure result is very sensitive to the light source, especially in large area exposure. Regular defects occurs in large area exposure result when the laser source has multiple longitudinal mode or mode hopping. Therefore, this paper design and build up an advanced achromatic interference lithography system to solve this problem. Due to the principle of achromatic interference lithography, the exposure result is no longer relative to the wavelength of the laser source, and the pitch of the periodic structures is half of the grating pitch. As a result, achromatic interference lithography is able to eliminate the regular defects caused by the unstable laser source. But traditional achromatic interference lithography system is not very efficient due to transmission lost and only first order light is used. This paper build up an advanced achromatic interference lithography system with two reflective blazed gratings. Because of the principle of the reflective blazed grating, we can improve the efficiency of our achromatic interference lithography system. In this paper, 20 mm2 of large area periodic structures with 420nm pitch and 130 nm linewidth have been successfully fabricated without any defects.", "As patterns shrink to the resolution limits of up-to-date ArF immersion lithography technology, negative tone development (NTD) process has been an increasingly adopted technique to get superior imaging quality through employing bright-field (BF) masks to print the critical dark-field (DF) metal and contact layers. However, from the fundamental materials and process interaction perspectives, several key differences inherently exist between NTD process and the traditional positive tone development (PTD) system, especially the horizontal/vertical resist shrinkage and developer depletion effects, hence the traditional resist parameters developed for the typical PTD process have no longer fit well in NTD process modeling. In order to cope with the inherent differences between PTD and NTD processes accordingly get improvement on NTD modeling accuracy, several NTD models with different combinations of complementary terms were built to account for the NTD-specific resist shrinkage, developer depletion and diffusion, and wafer CD jump induced by sub threshold assistance feature (SRAF) effects. Each new complementary NTD term has its definite aim to deal with the NTD-specific phenomena. In this study, the modeling accuracy is compared among different models for the specific patterning characteristics on various feature types. Multiple complementary NTD terms were finally proposed to address all the NTD-specific behaviors simultaneously and further optimize the NTD modeling accuracy. The new algorithm of multiple complementary NTD term tested on our critical dark-field layers demonstrates consistent model accuracy improvement for both calibration and verification.", "Source Mask Optimization (SMO) has played an important role in technology setup and ground rule definition since the 2x nm technology node. While improvements in SMO algorithms have produced higher quality and more consistent results, the accuracy of the overall solution is critically linked to how faithfully the entire patterning system is modeled, from mask down to substrate. Fortunately, modeling technology has continued to advance to provide greater accuracy in modeling 3D mask effects, 3D resist behavior, and resist phenomena. Specifically, the Domain Decomposition Method (DDM) approximates the 3D mask response as a superposition of edge-responses.1 The DDM can be applied to a sectorized illumination source based on Hybrid-Hopkins Abbe approximation,2 which provides an accurate and fast solution for the modeling of 3D mask effects and has been widely used in OPC modeling. The implementation of DDM in the SMO flow, however, is more challenging because the shape and intensity of the source, unlike the case in OPC modeling, is evolving along the optimization path. As a result, it gets more complicated. It is accepted that inadequate pupil sectorization results in reduced accuracy in any application, however in SMO the required uniformity and density of pupil sampling is higher than typical OPC and modeling cases. In this paper, we describe a novel method to implement DDM in the SMO flow. The source sectorization is defined by following the universal pixel sizes used in SMO. Fast algorithms are developed to enable computation of edge signals from each fine pixel of the source. In this case, each pixel has accurate information to describe its contribution to imaging and the overall objective function. A more continuous angular spectrum from 3D mask scattering is thus captured, leading to accurate modeling of 3D mask effects throughout source optimization. This method is applied on a 2x nm middle-of-line layer test case. The impact of the 3D mask model accuracy on the source profile and corresponding lithographic performance is studied in detail. Furthermore, the impact of using a compact resist model in SMO is also investigated by using the same test case.", "In this paper, we present the approach and results of layer-aware source mask target optimization. In this approach, the design target is co-optimized during source mask optimization (SMO) by considering inter-layer constraints. We tested the method on a 2x nm node metal layer by using both standard and customized cost functions for source optimization. Variable targets were defined for two process window limiting critical pattern cells, with contact-to-metal and metal-tovia coverage rules taken into consideration. The results indicate that layer-aware source mask target optimization gives consistent process window improvement over conventional SMO. The optimized targets prove to be a good balance between lithography process window and post-etch inter-layer coverage margin.", "Process window OPC (PWOPC) is widely used in advanced technology nodes as one of the most important resolution enhancement techniques (RET).1 PWOPC needs to consider not only edge placement error (EPE) from nominal condition simulations, but also constraints based on process variation simulations, such as pinch and bridge related requirements based on process variation band (PVBAND). Those constraints can be challenging to meet as feature size continues to shrink in advanced nodes.\nIn this paper a novel matrix retargeting based PWOPC was developed to find optimal OPC solutions by solving constraints-based matrix and applying minimal retargeting as needed.2 Experiment results showed enhanced process window and reasonable performance.", "Controlling critical dimension (CD) of implant blocking layers during photolithography has been challenging due to reflection caused by wafer topography. Unexpected reflection which comes from wafer topography makes severe CD variation on mask patterns of implant layer. Using bottom antireflective coatings(BARCs) can reduce the topography effect, but it could also damage wafer surface during BARCs dry etching. Developable BARCs(D-BARCs) could be alternative solution for wafer topography effect. However there are some issues that should be considered in D-BARCs process such as sensitive temperature control and managing defects. There are also papers introducing model based topography aware OPC as a solution for wafer topography effect implant layer. But building topography aware OPC model is very complex and it takes too much time to build.\nIn this paper, we will introduce experimental results of wafer topography effect using various test patterns and propose a simple method that could effectively reduce wafer topography effect.", "Triple patterning (TP) lithography becomes a feasible technology for manufacturing as the feature size further scale down to sub 14/10 nm. In TP, a layout is decomposed into three masks followed with exposures and etches/freezing processes respectively. Previous works mostly focus on layout decomposition with minimal conflicts and stitches simultaneously. However, since any existence of native conflict will result in layout re-design/modification and reperforming the time-consuming decomposition, the effective method that can be aware of native conflicts (NCs) in layout is desirable. In this paper, a bin-based library matching method is proposed for NCs detection and layout decomposition. First, a layout is divided into bins and the corresponding conflict graph in each bin is constructed. Then, we match the conflict graph in a prebuilt colored library, and as a result the NCs can be located and highlighted quickly.", "Light source technological performance is key to enabling chipmaker yield and production success. Just as important is ensuring that performance is consistent over time to help maintain as high an uptime as possible on litho-cells (scanner and track combination). While it is common to see average tool uptime of over 99% based on service intervention time, we will show that there are opportunities to improve equipment availability through a multifaceted approach that can deliver favorable results and significantly improve on the actual production efficiency of equipment.\nThe majority of chipmakers are putting light source data generated by tools such as Cymer OnLine (COL), OnPulse Plus, and SmartPulse to good use. These data sets, combined with in-depth knowledge of the equipment, makes it possible to draw powerful conclusions that help increase both chip manufacturing consistency as well as equipment productivity. This discussion will focus on the latter, equipment availability, and how data analysis can help increase equipment availability for Cymer customers.\nThere are several types of opportunities for increasing equipment availability, but in general we can focus on two primary categories: 1) scheduled downtime and 2) unscheduled downtime. For equipment that is under control of a larger entity, as the laser is to the scanner, there are additional categories related to either communication errors or better synchronization of events that can maximize overall litho-cell efficiency. In this article we will focus on general availability without highlighting the specific cause of litho-cell (laser, scanner and track). The goal is to increase equipment available time with a primary focus is on opportunities to minimize errors and variabilities.", "In response to significant neon supply constraints, Cymer has responded with a multi-part plan to support its customers. Cymer\u2019s primary objective is to ensure that reliable system performance is maintained while minimizing gas consumption. Gas algorithms were optimized to ensure stable performance across all operating conditions.\nThe Cymer neon support plan contains four elements: 1. Gas reduction program to reduce neon by >50% while maintaining existing performance levels and availability; 2. short-term containment solutions for immediate relief. 3. qualification of additional gas suppliers; and 4. long-term recycling/reclaim opportunity. The Cymer neon reduction program has shown excellent results as demonstrated through the comparison on standard gas use versus the new >50% reduced neon performance for ArF immersion light sources. Testing included stressful conditions such as repetition rate, duty cycle and energy target changes. No performance degradation has been observed over typical gas lives.", "Multiple patterning ArF immersion lithography has been expected as the promising technology to satisfy tighter leading edge device requirements. A new ArF excimer laser, GT64A has been developed to cope with the prevention against rare resource shortage and the reduction of operational costs. GT64A provides the sophisticated technologies which realize the narrow spectral bandwidth with helium free operation. A helium gas purge has usually been employed due to the low refractive index variation with temperature rises within a line narrowing module(LNM). Helium is a non-renewable resource and the world\u2019s reserves have been running out. Nitrogen gas with an affordable price has been used as an alternative purge gas of helium on the restrictive condition of low thermal loads. However, the refractive index variation of nitrogen gas is approximately ten times more sensitive to temperature rises than that of helium, and broadens a spectral bandwidth in the high duty cycle operations. The new LNM design enables heat effect in laser shooting at optical elements and mechanical components in the vicinity of an optical path to be lower. This reduces thermal wavefront deformation of a laser beam without helium gas purge within LNM, and narrows a spectrum bandwidth without helium purge. Gigaphoton proved that the new LNM enabled E95 bandwidth without control to improve a lot with nitrogen purge.", "There are growing concerns over future environmental impact and earth resource shortage throughout the world and in many industries. Our semiconductor industry is not excluded. \"Green\" has become an important topic as production volume become larger and more powerful.\nEspecially, the rare gases are widely used in semiconductor manufacturing because of its inertness and extreme chemical stability. One major component of an Excimer laser system is Neon. It is used as a buffer gas for Argon (Ar) and Krypton (Kr) gases used in deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography laser systems. Since Neon gas accounting for more than 96% of the laser gas mixture, a fairly large amount of neon gas is consumed to run these DUV lasers. However, due to country's instability both in politics and economics in Ukraine, the main producer of neon gas today, supply reduction has become an issue and is causing increasing concern. This concern is not only based on price increases, but has escalated to the point of supply shortages in 2015. This poses a critical situation for the semiconductor industry, which represents the leading consumer of neon gas in the world. Helium is another noble gas used for Excimer laser operation. It is used as a purge gas for optical component modules to prevent from being damaged by active gases and impurities. Helium has been used in various industries, including for medical equipment, linear motor cars, and semiconductors, and is indispensable for modern life. But consumption of helium in manufacturing has been increased dramatically, and its unstable supply and price rise has been a serious issue today. In this article, recent global supply issue of rare resources, especially Neon gas and Helium gas, and its solution technology to support semiconductor industry will be discussed.", "The Semiconductor Industry is making continuous progress in shrinking feature size developing technologies and process to achieve < 10 nm feature size. The required Overlay specification for successful production is in the range one nanometer or even smaller. Consequently, materials designed into metrology systems of exposure or inspection tools need to fulfill ever tighter specification on the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The glass ceramic ZERODUR\u00ae is a well-established material in critical components of microlithography wafer stepper and offered with an extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion, the tightest tolerance available on market. SCHOTT is continuously improving manufacturing processes and it\u2019s method to measure and characterize the CTE behavior of ZERODUR\u00ae. This paper is focusing on the \"Advanced Dilatometer\" for determination of the CTE developed at SCHOTT in the recent years and introduced into production in Q1 2015. The achievement for improving the absolute CTE measurement accuracy and the reproducibility are described in detail. Those achievements are compared to the CTE measurement accuracy reported by the Physikalische Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), the National Metrology Institute of Germany. The CTE homogeneity is of highest importance to achieve nanometer precision on larger scales. Additionally, the paper presents data on the short scale CTE homogeneity and its improvement in the last two years. The data presented in this paper will explain the capability of ZERODUR\u00ae to enable the extreme precision required for future generation of lithography equipment and processes.", "This paper, originally published on 15 March 2016, was retracted from the SPIE Digital Library on 14 December 2021 upon verification that it was a duplicate publication of the following paper:\n\nA.

Waveplates are basic and indispensable optical components in the polarimetric diagnosis tools for the immersion lithography system. The retardance of a birefringent waveplate is highly sensitive to the incident angle of the light, which makes the conventional waveplate not suitable to be applied in the polarimetric diagnosis for the immersion lithography system with a hyper NA. In this paper, we propose a method for the optimal design of a wideview- angle waveplate by combining two positive waveplates made from magnesium fluoride (MgF2) and two negative waveplates made from sapphire using the simulated annealing algorithm. Theoretical derivations and numerical simulations are performed and the results demonstrate that the maximum variation in the retardance of the optimally designed wide-view-angle waveplate is less than \u00b1 0.35\u00b0 for a wide-view-angle range of \u00b1 20\u00b0.", "The aberration inspection of Shack-Hartmann of lithographic lens has reached the nanometer inspection accuracy. Collimator as the key element of the system, the accurate positioning of itself is one important factor for the inspection accuracy. Based on the wavefront reconstruction with Zernike polynomials, in this paper, an optical alignment method for positioning adjustments of the collimator is presented. A sensitivity matrix is obtained from the equation that describes the correlation between Zernike coefficients and the multi-degree-of-freedom misalignment, and the positioning adjustments of collimator are acquired thereof. For the aberration inspection with Shack-Hartmann method, an engineering model of 193nm NA 0.75 projection lens is established in commercial simulating software (ZEMAX). For 0.5nm RMS aberration inspection accuracy, the positioning accuracy of collimator is analyzed and plotted with independent single freedom degree and mutual correlation with combined three freedom degrees. These analysis indicate the proposed method is a viable tool for aligning confocal position of collimator.", "The application of accurate and predictive physical resist simulation is seen as one important use model for fast and efficient exploration of new patterning technology options, especially if fully qualified OPC models are not yet available at an early pre-production stage. The methodology of using a top-down CD-SEM metrology to extract the 3D resist profile information, such as the critical dimension (CD) at various resist heights, has to be associated with a series of presumptions which may introduce such small, but systematic CD errors. Ideally, the metrology effects should be carefully minimized during measurement process, or if possible be taken into account through proper metrology modeling. In this paper we discuss the application of a fast SEM signal emulation describing the SEM image formation. The algorithm is applied to simulated resist 3D profiles and produces emulated SEM image results for 1D and 2D patterns. It allows estimating resist simulation quality by comparing CDs which were extracted from the emulated and from the measured SEM images.\nMoreover, SEM emulation is applied for resist model calibration to capture subtle error signatures through dose and defocus. Finally, it should be noted that our SEM emulation methodology is based on the approximation of physical phenomena which are taking place in real SEM image formation. This approximation allows achieving better speed performance compared to a fully physical model.", "The 2x nm logic foundry node has many challenges since critical levels are pushed close to the limits of low k1 ArF water immersion lithography. For these levels, improvements in lithographic performance can translate to decreased rework and increased yield. Source Mask Optimization (SMO) is one such route to realize these image fidelity improvements. During SMO, critical layout constructs are intensively optimized in both the mask and source domain, resulting in a solution for maximum lithographic entitlement. From the hardware side, advances in source technology have enabled free-form illumination. The approach allows highly customized illumination, enabling the practical application of SMO sources. The customized illumination sources can be adjusted for maximum versatility. In this paper, we present a study on a critical layer of an advanced foundry logic node using the latest ILT based SMO software, paired with state-of-the-art scanner hardware and intelligent illuminator. Performance of the layer's existing POR source is compared with the ideal SMO result and the installed source as realized on the intelligent illuminator of an NSR-S630D scanner. Both simulation and on-silicon measurements are used to confirm that the performance of the studied layer meets established specifications.", "As leading edge lithography moves to advanced nodes, CDU requirements have relatively increased with technologies 14nm/20nm and beyond. In this paper, we want to introduce the methodology to offer an itemized CDU budget such as Intra-field, Inter-field, wafer to wafer as well as scanner contributors vs. non-scanner contributors (including detailed analysis of reticle contributors like CD, absorber thickness and SWA variation) through Top-Down CDU and Bottom-Up CDU budget breakdown and deliver sources of CD variation with measureable value so that we can estimate CDU gain from them. The test vehicle being used in this experiment is designed based on 14nm D/R basis. Measurement structures are densely located in the slit/scan direction on the reticle for the data collection plan. Hence, we can expand on this methodology to build up the tool reference fingerprint when we release new tool fleet.

The SWMGs are intentionally created on the top surface of mask. Its polarization selectivity is deliberately designed according to the bottom mask patterns. A series of simulations and optimizations on SWMG structures were done in order to achieve better image quality. We demonstrate that the contrast of aerial image can be improved by designing the inverse polarizer on mask (iPOM) for some specific layout patterns. We also reveal that the double diffraction inevitably occurring in-between the iPOM and layout pattern may damage the image quality in most situations. This leads to narrow usage of iPOM. An alternative to overcome the double diffraction is proposed by optimizing the refractive index and thickness of layout absorber to make the polarization selection feasible without iPOM.", "The line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) transfer in a self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) process is shown for the first time.

The novel optical element, which is formed in a transparent material, generates two beam arrays at different wavelengths and allows their overlap at the process points on a workpiece. Since the splitter has a stochastically designed, complex, and deep surface profile, there is limited freedom in selecting a fabrication method. We designed the splitter using a simulated annealing algorithm and fabricated it in a photoresist through maskless exposure by using a digital micromirror device. We characterized the designed splitter, thereby corroborating the proposed beam-splitting concept.", "Today's design for photonics devices on silicon relies on non-Manhattan features such as curves and a wide variety of angles with minimum feature size below 100nm. Industrial manufacturing of such devices requires optimized process window with 193nm lithography. Therefore, Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RET) that are commonly used for CMOS manufacturing are required.\nHowever, most RET algorithms are based on Manhattan fragmentation (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0) which can generate large CD dispersion on masks for photonic designs. Industrial implementation of RET solutions to photonic designs is challenging as most currently available OPC tools are CMOS-oriented. Discrepancy from design to final results induced by RET techniques can lead to lower photonic device performance.\nWe propose a novel sizing algorithm allowing adjustment of design edge fragments while preserving the topology of the original structures. The results of the algorithm implementation in the rule based sizing, SRAF placement and model based correction will be discussed in this paper. Corrections based on this novel algorithm were applied and characterized on real photonics devices. The obtained results demonstrate the validity of the proposed correction method integrated in Inscale software of Aselta Nanographics.", "An efficient pixel-based mask optimization method via particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for inverse lithography is proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, the ease of implementation and the efficiency of convergence, PSO has been widely used in many fields. In this study, PSO is used to solve the inverse problem of mask optimization. The pixel-based mask patterns are transformed into frequency space using discrete cosine transformation and the frequency components are encoded into particles. The pattern fidelity is adopted as the fitness function to evaluate these particles. The mask optimization method is implemented by updating the velocities and positions of these particles. Simulation results show that the image fidelity has been efficiently improved after using the proposed method.", "In order to maximize yield, IC design companies spend a lot of effort to analyze what types of design styles are needed and used in their layouts (standard cells, macros, routing layers, and so forth). This paper introduces a novel methodology for full chip high performance topological pattern analysis and the applications of this methodology towards analyzing design styles in order to quantify and measure design changes and the degree of layout regularization. This new approach allows engineers to perform a full profiling across all patterns that exist in design and without needing to explicitly specify what patterns to analyze.", "At advanced technology nodes (sub-22 nm), design rules become very complicated as interactions between multiple layers become more complex, while the number of design elements within the optical radius increases. As a result, one may possibly encounter novel yield limiters in the 2D/3D design space with every new product taping out to the fab. Key to fast yield ramp is identifying novel constructs that may become yield detractors, and to address the challenge in the DFM space before actual Silicon is run. A comprehensive methodology to find such geometric constructs is proposed.", "During a new technology node process setup phase, foundries do not initially have enough product chip designs to conduct exhaustive process development. Different operational teams use manually designed simple test keys to set up their process flows and recipes. When the very first version of the design rule manual (DRM) is ready, foundries enter the process development phase where new experiment design data is manually created based on these design rules. However, these IP/test keys contain very uniform or simple design structures. This kind of design normally does not contain critical design structures or process unfriendly design patterns that pass design rule checks but are found to be less manufacturable. It is desired to have a method to generate exhaustive test patterns allowed by design rules at development stage to verify the gap of design rule and process.\nThis paper presents a novel method of how to generate test key patterns which contain known problematic patterns as well as any constructs which designers could possibly draw based on current design rules. The enumerated test key patterns will contain the most critical design structures which are allowed by any particular design rule. A layout profiling method is used to do design chip analysis in order to find potential weak points on new incoming products so fab can take preemptive action to avoid yield loss. It can be achieved by comparing different products and leveraging the knowledge learned from previous manufactured chips to find possible yield detractors.", "A pattern-based methodology for optimizing Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP)-compliant layout designs is developed based on detecting cut-induced hotspot patterns and replacing them with pre-characterized fixing solutions. A pattern library with predetermined fixing solutions is built. A pattern-based engine searches for matching patterns in the layout designs. When a match is found, the engine opportunistically replaces the detected pattern with a pre-characterized fixing solution, preserving only the design rule check-clean replacements. The methodology is demonstrated on a 10nm routed block. A small library of fourteen patterns reduced the number of cut-induced design rule check violations by 100% and lithography hotspots by 23%.", "As minimum feature sizes shrink, unexpected hotspots appear on wafers. Therefore, it is important to detect and fix these hotspots at design stage to reduce development time and manufacturing cost. Currently, as the most accurate approach, lithography simulation is widely used to detect such hotspots. However, it is known to be time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel aerial image synthesizing method using regression and minimum lithography simulation for only hotspot detection. Experimental results show hotspot detection on the proposed method is equivalent compared with the results on the conventional hotspot detection method which uses only lithography simulation with much less computational cost.", "Variability modeling at the compact transistor model level can enable statistically optimized designs in view of limitations imposed by the fabrication technology. In this work we propose a variability-aware compact model characterization methodology based on stepwise parameter selection. Transistor I-V measurements are obtained from bit transistor accessible SRAM test array fabricated using a collaborating foundry\u2019s 28nm FDSOI technology. Our in-house customized Monte Carlo simulation bench can incorporate these statistical compact models; and simulation results on SRAM writability performance are very close to measurements in distribution estimation. Our proposed statistical compact model parameter extraction methodology also has the potential of predicting non-Gaussian behavior in statistical circuit performances through mixtures of Gaussian distributions.", "In this paper, we propose a novel modular patterning technology to reduce the edge-placement errors (EPE) significantly by combining alternating-material self-aligned multiple patterning (altSAMP) and selective etching processes. It is assumed that gates and fins are fabricated by the same type of altSAMP process as mixing two different processing techniques will drive up the manufacturing costs. Process variability induced circuit performance degradation is shown to be a serious issue as FinFET devices are scaled down to sub-10nm. We analyze the dependence of FinFET-based SRAM circuit performance on supply voltage, fin-width and gate-length variations. Improved device control with narrower fins helps to increase the static noise margin (SNM) in all SRAM cell designs. Higher supply voltage is also beneficial to the SNM performance. Our simulation results show that 6-T SRAM circuit design does not meet the six-sigma yield requirement when the half pitch is scaled down to sub-7 nm. To reduce the SRAM circuit variability, we study an 8-T SRAM cell and show that it significantly improves the SRAM performance.", "Publisher\u2019s Note: This paper, originally published on March 16th, was replaced with a corrected/revised version on March 28th. If you downloaded the original PDF but are unable to access the revision, please contact SPIE Digital Library Customer Service for assistance.\nInterconnect corners should accurately reflect the effect of misalingment in LELE double patterning process. Misalignment is usually considered separately from interconnect structure variations; this incurs too much pessimism and fails to reflect a large increase in total capacitance for asymmetric interconnect structure. We model interconnect corners by taking account of misalignment in conjunction with interconnect structure variations; we also characterize misalignment effect more accurately by handling metal pitch at both sides of a target metal independently. Identifying metal space at both sides of a target metal.", "Traditional RC extraction flows mostly consider interconnect thickness variations caused by etch and CMP processes in a way of rule-based approach where a form of tables or polynomials is used. While such rulebased approaches are easily incorporated into design flows, they are not inevitably accurate since tablelook- ups in rules are inherently taking simple (mostly one dimensional) typed patterns. Moreover, rules fail to account for the length scale and cumulative effects in both etch and CMP, thereby making them less accurate compared to physics-based models. In this paper, we introduce a model-based CMP aware RC extraction flow that uses the results of thickness simulations from Cadence CMP modeling tools. We apply the proposed model-based CMP aware RC extraction flow to several blocks in a 16 nm design, and compare the results of the proposed model-based flow with those of a traditional rule-based RC extraction flow. This paper also notes that running the model-based flow in conjunction with the traditional rule-based flow should cover the full range of RC variation along critical nets, and ensure faster timing closure.", "Lithography hotspot detection in the physical verification phase is one of the most important techniques in today's optical lithography based manufacturing process. Although lithography simulation based hotspot detection is widely used, it is also known to be time-consuming. To detect hotspots in a short runtime, several machine learning based methods have been proposed. However, it is difficult to realize highly accurate detection without an increase in false alarms because an appropriate layout feature is undefined. This paper proposes a new method to automatically extract a proper layout feature from a given layout for improvement in detection performance of machine learning based methods. Experimental results show that using a deep neural network can achieve better performance than other frameworks using manually selected layout features and detection algorithms, such as conventional logistic regression or artificial neural network.", "In this paper, we introduce a fast and reasonably accurate methodology to determine patterning difficulty based on the fundamentals of optical image processing techniques to analyze the frequency content of design shapes which determines patterning difficulties via a computational patterning transfer function. In addition, with the help of Monte- Carlo random pattern generator, we use this flow to identify a set of difficult patterns that can be used to evaluate the design ease-of-manufacturability via a scoring methodology as well as to help with the optimization phases of post-tape out flows. This flow offers the combined merits of scoring-based criteria and model-based approach for early designs. The value of this approach is that it provides designers with early prediction of potential problems even before the rigorous model-based DFM kits are developed. Moreover, the flow establishes a bi-directional platform for interaction between the design and the manufacturing communities based on geometrical patterns.", "Multiple-Patterning Technology (MPT) is still the preferred choice over EUV for the advanced technology nodes, starting the 20nm node. Down the way to 7nm and 5nm nodes, Self-Aligned Multiple Patterning (SAMP) appears to be one of the effective multiple patterning techniques in terms of achieving small pitch of printed lines on wafer, yet its yield is in question. Predicting and enhancing the yield in the early stages of technology development are some of the main objectives for creating test macros on test masks. While conventional yield ramp techniques for a new technology node have relied on using designs from previous technology nodes as a starting point to identify patterns for Design of Experiment (DoE) creation, these techniques are challenging to apply in the case of introducing an MPT technique like SAMP that did not exist in previous nodes.\nThis paper presents a new strategy for generating test structures based on random placement of unit patterns that can construct more meaningful bigger patterns. Specifications governing the relationships between those unit patterns can be adjusted to generate layout clips that look like realistic SAMP designs. A via chain can be constructed to connect the random DoE of SAMP structures through a routing layer to external pads for electrical measurement. These clips are decomposed according to the decomposition rules of the technology into the appropriate mandrel and cut masks. The decomposed clips can be tested through simulations, or electrically on silicon to discover hotspots.\nThe hotspots can be used in optimizing the fabrication process and models to fix them. They can also be used as learning patterns for DFM deck development. By expanding the size of the randomly generated test structures, more hotspots can be detected. This should provide a faster way to enhance the yield of a new technology node.", "As we move to advanced technology nodes, the requirements on within chip and across wafer planarity are becoming more demanding [1]. Also, the number of Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) processes and steps used in microelectronic chip manufacturing is increasing rapidly, in an effort to meet the stringent planarity requirements [1]. However, the complex pattern dependencies inherent in CMP processes, and the cumulative nature of the topography generated by these processes make it challenging to meet the aforementioned stringent uniformity requirements for the variety of designs produced. Consequently, we expect to see an increased CMP and related hotspots on advanced node designs. Accurately detecting CMP and related hotspots (such as pooling, DOF hotspots, topography variation hotspots etc.) and providing guidelines to fix or prevent them is therefore critical for CMP process development, yield ramp up and shorter design and manufacturing cycles.\nIn this paper we present a hotspot detection and removal/prevention flow. The flow uses Cadence Design System\u2019s manufacturing modeling methodology that predicts feature scale, within chip, and wafer level topography. The modeling methodology takes into account etch depth, deposition, and CMP variations across multiple levels in the design, and across multiple process steps within a given design level.", "As technology moves towards more advanced nodes, the complexity of VLSI designs continues to grow and unexpected designs in physical layout push the process limits. In the beginning of a new technology node development there are not enough real design chips with complex structures and it is hard for foundries to comprehensively verify their process capabilities. It is necessary for foundries to generate a comprehensive set of test patterns to co-optimize the design rule manual (DRM) and manufacturing process. Furthermore, as the technology goes into an accelerated yield ramp phase, we need to find the potential process weak-points and identify the gaps between the design rules and the process.\nThis paper will present a novel methodology to enumerate initial test patterns based on other technology node products. With this novel methodology, DRM development and process capability verification can be sped up rapidly in comparison to a more traditional way. At the same time, the process weak-point signatures can be migrated from the older technology nodes to the new technology node for verification. This methodology will help foundries catch process detractor patterns at new technology early development stage.", "As feature size of the semiconductor technology scales down to 10nm and beyond, multiple patterning lithography (MPL) has become one of the most practical candidates for lithography, along with other emerging technologies such as extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), e-beam lithography (EBL) and directed self assembly (DSA). Due to the delay of EUVL and EBL, triple and even quadruple patterning are considered to be used for lower metal and contact layers with tight pitches. In the process of MPL, layout decomposition is the key design stage, where a layout is split into various parts and each part is manufactured through a separate mask. For metal layers, stitching may be allowed to resolve conflicts, while it is forbidden for contact and via layers.\nIn this paper, we focus on the application of layout decomposition where stitching is not allowed such as for contact and via layers. We propose a linear programming and iterative rounding (LPIR) solving technique to reduce the number of non-integers in the LP relaxation problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can provide high quality decomposition solutions efficiently while introducing as few conflicts as possible.", "In recent years, major advancements have been made in the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs). As a result, the insertion of DSA for IC fabrication is being actively considered for the sub-7nm nodes. At these nodes the DSA technology could alleviate costs for multiple patterning and limit the number of litho masks that would be required per metal layer. One of the most straightforward approaches for DSA implementation would be for via patterning through templated DSA, where hole patterns are readily accessible through templated confinement of cylindrical phase BCP materials.\nOur in-house studies show that decomposition of via layers in realistic circuits below the 7nm node would require at least many multi-patterning steps (or colors), using 193nm immersion lithography. Even the use of EUV might require double patterning in these dimensions, since the minimum via distance would be smaller than EUV resolution. The grouping of vias through templated DSA can resolve local conflicts in high density areas. This way, the number of required colors can be significantly reduced.\nFor the implementation of this approach, a DSA-aware mask decomposition is required. In this paper, our design approach for DSA via patterning in sub-7nm nodes is discussed. We propose options to expand the list of DSA-compatible via patterns (DSA letters) and we define matching cost formulas for the optimal DSA-aware layout decomposition. The flowchart of our proposed approach tool is presented.", "For technologies beyond 10 nm, 1D gridded designs are commonly used. This practice is common particularly in the case of Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) metal processes where Vertical Interconnect Access (VIA) connecting metal line layers are placed along a discrete grid thus limiting the number of VIA pitches. In order to create a Vertical Interconnect Access (VIA) layer, graphoepitaxy Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) is the prevailing candidate. The technique relies on the creation of a confinement guide using optical microlithography methods, in which the BCP is allowed to separate into distinct regions. The resulting patterns are etched to obtain an ordered VIA layer.\nGuiding pattern variations impact directly on the placement of the target and one must ensure that it does not interfere with circuit performance. To prevent flaws, design rules are set. In this study, for the first time, an original framework is presented to find a consistent set of design rules for enabling the use of DSA in a production flow using Self Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) for metal line layer printing.\nIn order to meet electrical requirements, the intersecting area between VIA and metal lines must be sufficient to ensure correct electrical connection. The intersecting area is driven by both VIA placement variability and metal line printing variability. Based on multiple process assumptions for a 10 nm node, the Monte Carlo method is used to set a maximum threshold for VIA placement error.\nIn addition, to determine a consistent set of design rules, representative test structures have been created and tested with our in-house placement estimator: the topological skeleton of the guiding pattern [1]. Using this technique, structures with deviation above the maximum tolerated threshold are considered as infeasible and the appropriate set of design rules is extracted. In a final step, the design rules are verified with further test structures that are randomly generated using percolation in order to emulate a Placed and Routed (P&R) standard cell block.", "To overcome the prohibitive barriers of edge-placement errors (EPE) in the cut/block/via step of complementary lithography, we propose a modular patterning approach by combining layout stitching, selective etching, and alternating-material self-aligned multiple patterning (altSAMP) processes. In this patterning approach, altSAMP is used to create line arrays with two materials alternatively which allow a highly selective etching process to remove one material without attacking the other, therefore more significant EPE effect can be tolerated in line-cutting step. With no need of connecting vias, the stitching process can form 2-D features by directly stitching two components of patterns together to create 2-D design freedom as well as multiple-CD/pitch capability. By adopting this novel approach, we can potentially achieve higher processing yield and more 2-D design freedom for continuous IC scaling down to 5 nm. We developed layout decomposition and synthesis algorithms for critical layers, and the fin/gate/metal layer from NSCU open cell library is used to test the proposed algorithms.", "One of the key challenges while scaling logic down to N7 and N5 is the requirement of self-aligned multiple patterning for the metal stack. This comes with a large cost of the backend cost and therefore a careful stack optimization is required. Various layers in the stack have different purposes and therefore their choice of pitch and number of layers is critical. Furthermore, when in ultra scaled dimensions of N7 or N5, the number of patterning options are also much larger ranging from multiple LE, EUV to SADP/SAQP. The right choice of these are also needed patterning techniques that use a full grating of wires like SADP/SAQP techniques introduce high level of metal dummies into the design. This implies a large capacitance penalty to the design therefore having large performance and power penalties. This is often mitigated with extra masking strategies. This paper discusses a holistic view of metal stack optimization from standard cell level all the way to routing and the corresponding trade-off that exist for this space.", "In a sub 2Xnm node process, the feedback of pattern weak points is more and more significant. Therefore, it is very important to extract the systemic defect in Double Patterning Technology(DPT), however, it is impossible to predict exact systemic defect at the recent photo simulation tool.[1] Therefore, the method of Process Window Qualification (PWQ) is very serious and essential these days.\nConventional PWQ methods are die to die image comparison by using an e-beam or bright field machine. Results are evaluated by the person, who reviews the images, in some cases. However, conventional die to die comparison method has critical problem. If reference die and comparison die have same problem, such as both of dies have pattern problems, the issue patterns are not detected by current defect detecting approach. Aside from the inspection accuracy, reviewing the wafer requires much effort and time to justify the genuine issue patterns. Therefore, our company adopts die to data based matching PWQ method that is using NGR machine. The main features of the NGR are as follows. First, die to data based matching, second High speed, finally massive data were used for evaluation of pattern inspection.[2] Even though our die to data based matching PWQ method measures the mass data, our margin decision process is based on image shape. Therefore, it has some significant problems.\nFirst, because of the long analysis time, the developing period of new device is increased. Moreover, because of the limitation of resources, it may not examine the full chip area. Consequently, the result of PWQ weak points cannot represent the all the possible defects. Finally, since the PWQ margin is not decided by the mathematical value, to make the solid definition of killing defect is impossible.\nTo overcome these problems, we introduce a statistical values base process window qualification method that increases the accuracy of process margin and reduces the review time. Therefore, it is possible to see the genuine margin of the critical pattern issue which we cannot see on our conventional PWQ inspection; hence we can enhance the accuracy of PWQ margin.", "The concept of the multi-source focus correlation method was presented in 2015 [1, 2]. A more accurate understanding of real on-product focus can be obtained by gathering information from different sectors: design, scanner short loop monitoring, scanner leveling, on-product focus and topography.\nThis work will show that chip topography can be predicted from reticle density and perimeter density data, including experimental proof. Different pixel sizes are used to perform the correlation in-line with the minimum resolution, correlation length of CMP effects and the spot size of the scanner level sensor. Potential applications of the topography determination will be evaluated, including optimizing scanner leveling by ignoring non-critical parts of the field, and without the need for time-consuming offline topography measurements.", "In this paper, we examine two types of 2-D layout design methodology (via connecting and direct stitching) for future IC scaling. The yield model for via landing process is first developed based on the probability-of-success (POS) function, which incorporates the overlay errors and via CD variations. A layout library is constructed using the 2-D patterns in 45-nm and 15-nm open cell libraries, and the basic stitching structures are identified. Six commonly seen stitching structures in our layout library are analyzed. The optimization methods for via landing and direct stitching are discussed. We compare the yield performance of via landing and direct stitching (with and without optimization). It is found that direct-stitching yield is better than the via-landing yield for all types of vias in the 2-D layouts we examined, regardless of whether the optimization procedure is performed.", "Looking for the highest density and best performance, the 14nm technological node saw the development of aggressive designs, with design rules as close as possible to the limit of the process. Edge placement error (EPE) budget is now tighter and Reticle Enhancement Techniques (RET) must take into account the highest number of parameters to be able to get the best printability and guaranty yield requirements. Overlay is a parameter that must be taken into account earlier during the design library development to avoid design structures presenting a high risk of performance failure.\nThis paper presents a method taking into account the overlay variation and the Resist Image simulation across the process window variation to estimate the design sensitivity to overlay. Areas in the design are classified with specific metrics, from the highest to the lowest overlay sensitivity. This classification can be used to evaluate the robustness of a full chip product to process variability or to work with designers during the design library development. The ultimate goal is to evaluate critical structures in different contexts and report the most critical ones.\nIn this paper, we study layers interacting together, such as Contact/Poly area overlap or Contact/Active distance. ASML-Brion tooling allowed simulating the different resist contours and applying the overlay value to one of the layers. Lithography Manufacturability Check (LMC) detectors are then set to extract the desired values for analysis.\nTwo different approaches have been investigated. The first one is a systematic overlay where we apply the same overlay everywhere on the design. The second one is using a real overlay map which has been measured and applied to the LMC tools. The data are then post-processed and compared to the design target to create a classification and show the error distribution. Figure:", "Memory industry has been pursuing endless shrinking technology which increases fabrication complexity. It poses problems between adjacent layers as well as within a single layer. To verify the interlayer design, we have developed the interlayer design verification methodology using contour image. Our methodology makes it possible to verify interlayer design visually by extracting the contour image from the real patterns. And we can verify interlayer design even during the fabrication process and conduct a non-destructive inspection. Also this methodology provides a statistical analysis of massive measured data. Through this methodology, we can calculate the margin of current interlayer design and suggest the requirement of design.", "In order to resolve the causality dilemma of which comes first, accurate design rules or real designs, this paper presents a flow for exploration of the layout design space to early identify problematic patterns that will negatively affect the yield.\nA new random layout generating method called Layout Schema Generator (LSG) is reported in this paper, this method generates realistic design-like layouts without any design rule violation. Lithography simulation is then used on the generated layout to discover the potentially problematic patterns (hotspots). These hotspot patterns are further explored by randomly inducing feature and context variations to these identified hotspots through a flow called Hotspot variation Flow (HSV). Simulation is then performed on these expanded set of layout clips to further identify more problematic patterns.\nThese patterns are then classified into design forbidden patterns that should be included in the design rule checker and legal patterns that need better handling in the RET recipes and processes.", "Design and technology co-optimization (DTCO) can satisfy the needs of the design, generate robust design rule, and avoid unfriendly patterns at the early stage of design to ensure a high level of manufacturability of the product by the technical capability of the present process. The DTCO methodology in this paper includes design rule translation, layout analysis, model validation, hotspots classification and design rule optimization mainly. The correlation of the DTCO and double patterning (DPT) can optimize the related design rule and generate friendlier layout which meets the requirement of the 14/10nm technology node. The experiment demonstrates the methodology of DPT-compliant DTCO which is applied to a metal1 layer from the 14/10nm node. The DTCO workflow proposed in our job is an efficient solution for optimizing the design rules for 14/10 nm tech node Metal1 layer. And the paper also discussed and did the verification about how to tune the design rule of the U-shape and L-shape structures in a DPT-aware metal layer.", "Self-Aligned-Double-Patterning (SADP) is a potential technology for metal layers in N10 and beyond nodes. SADP manufacturing process comes with lots of challenges. Several approaches were introduced to manufacture SADP. The most major SADP manufacturing approach is the Spacer-Is-Dielectric (SID). One of the main advantages of SADP over Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch (LELE) Double Patterning (DP) is better Mask Overlay Control. In addition, SADP results in better process tolerance and lower Line-Width Roughness. In this paper, we propose a model-based manufacturing flow for SID-SADP approach. The flow includes: (1) SADP Patterns Decomposition, (2) Etch Retargeting, (3) Sub Resolution Assist Features (SRAF) Insertion, (4) Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) process, and finally (5) Verification. The motivation beyond developing this flow is to find the least number of needed masks to achieve satisfactory imaging quality, and to characterize possible challenges in each step of the flow. Consequently, we highlight the challenges and the proposed techniques we examined to meet this objective.", "At the advanced technology node, logic design has become extremely complex and is getting more challenging as the pattern geometry size decreases. The small sizes of layout patterns are becoming very sensitive to process variations. Meanwhile, the high pressure of yield ramp is always there due to time-to-market competition. The company that achieves patterning maturity earlier than others will have a great advantage and a better chance to realize maximum profit margins.\nFor debugging silicon failures, DFT diagnostics can identify which nets or cells caused the yield loss. But normally, a long time period is needed with many resources to identify which failures are due to one common layout pattern or structure. This paper will present a new yield diagnostic flow, based on preliminary EFA results, to show how pattern analysis can more efficiently detect pattern related systematic defects. Increased visibility on design pattern related failures also allows more precise yield loss estimation.", "Among various electron-beam lithography (EBL) techniques, variable-shaped beam (VSB) and character projection (CP) methods have attracted many EBL users for their high-throughput feature, but they are considered to be more suited to small-featured VLSI fabrication with regularly-arranged layouts like standard-cell logics and memory arrays. On the other hand, non-VLSI applications like photonics, MEMS, MOEMS, and so on, have not been fully utilized the benefit of CP method due to their wide variety of layout patterns. In addition, the stepwise edge shapes by VSB method often causes intolerable edge roughness to degrade device characteristics from its intended performance with smooth edges.\nWe proposed an overall EBL methodology applicable to wade-variety of EBL applications utilizing VSB and CP methods. Its key idea is in our layout data conversion algorithm that decomposes curved or oblique edges of arbitrary layout patterns into CP shots. We expect significant reduction in EB shot count with a CP-bordered exposure data compared to the corresponding VSB-alone conversion result. Several CP conversion parameters are used to optimize EB exposure throughput, edge quality, and resultant device characteristics.\nWe demonstrated out methodology using the leading-edge VSB/CP EBL tool, ADVANTEST F7000S-VD02, with high resolution Hydrogen Silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist. Through our experiments of curved and oblique edge lithography under various data conversion conditions, we learned correspondence of the conversion parameters to the resultant edge roughness and other conditions. They will be utilized as the fundamental data for further enhancement of our EBL strategy for optimized EB exposure.", "A fast and inexpensive scheme for etch rate prediction using flexible continuum models and Bayesian statistics is demonstrated. Bulk etch rates of MgO are predicted using a steady-state model with volume-averaged plasma parameters and classical Langmuir surface kinetics. Plasma particle and surface kinetics are modeled within a global plasma framework using single component Metropolis Hastings methods and limited data. The accuracy of these predictions is evaluated with synthetic and experimental etch rate data for magnesium oxide in an ICP-RIE system. This approach is compared and superior to factorial models generated from JMP, a software package frequently employed for recipe creation and optimization.", "The utilization of a cut-mask in semiconductor patterning processes has been in practice for logic devices since the inception of 32nm-node devices, notably with unidirectional gate level printing. However, the microprocessor applications where cut-mask patterning methods are used are expanding as Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) processes become mainstream for 22/14nm fin diffusion, and sub-14nm metal levels. One common weakness for these types of lithography processes is that the initial pattern requiring the follow-up cut-mask typically uses an extreme off-axis imaging source such as dipole to enhance the resolution and line-width roughness (LWR) for critical dense patterns. This source condition suffers from poor process margin in the semi-dense (forbidden pitch) realm and wrong-way directional design spaces. Common pattern failures in these limited design regions include bridging and extra-printing defects that are difficult to resolve with traditional mask improvement means. This forces the device maker to limit the allowable geometries that a designer may use on a device layer.\nThis paper will demonstrate methods to expand the usable design space on dipole-like processes such as unidirectional gate and SADP processes by utilizing the follow-up cut mask to improve the process window. Traditional mask enhancement means for improving the process window in this design realm will be compared to this new cut-mask approach. The unique advantages and disadvantages of the cut-mask solution will be discussed in contrast to those customary methods.", "Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) has been a critical enabling technology in shallow trench isolation (STI), which is used in current integrated circuit fabrication process to accomplish device isolation. Excessive dishing and erosion in STI CMP processes, however, create device yield concerns. This paper proposes characterization and modeling techniques to address a variety of concerns in STI CMP. In the past, majority of CMP publications have been addressed on interconnect layers in backend- of-line (BEOL) process. However, the number of CMP steps in front-end-of-line (FEOL) has been increasing in more advanced process techniques like 3D-FinFET and replacement metal gate, as a results incoming topography induced by FEOL CMP steps can no longer be ignored as the topography accumulates and stacks up across multiple CMP steps and eventually propagating to BEOL layers. In this paper, we first discuss how to characterize and model STI CMP process. Once STI CMP model is developed, it can be used for screening design and detect possible manufacturing weak spots. We also work with process engineering team to establish hotspot criteria in terms of oxide dishing and nitride loss.\nAs process technologies move from planar transistor to 3D transistor like FinFet and multi-gate, it is important to accurately predict topography in FEOL CMP processes. These incoming topographies when stacked up can have huge impact in BEOL copper processes, where copper pooling becomes catastrophic yield loss. A calibration methodology to characterize STI CMP step is developed as shown in Figure 1; moreover, this STI CMP model is validated from silicon data collected from product chips not used in calibration stage. Additionally, wafer experimental setup and metrology plan are instrumental to an accurate model with high predictive power.\nAfter a model is generated, spec limits and threshold to establish hotspots criteria can be defined. Such definition requires working closely with foundry process engineering and integration team and reviewing past failure analysis (FA) to come up a reasonable metrics. Conventionally, a potential STI weak point can be found when nitride residues remains in the active region after nitride strip. Another source of STI hotspots occurs when nitride erosion is too much, and active region can suffer severe damage.", "This paper presents an automated DFM solution to generate Bit Line Pattern Dummy (BLPD) for memory devices. Dummy shapes are aligned with memory functional bits to ensure uniform and reliable memory device. This paper will present a smarter approach that uses an analysis based technique for adding the dummy shapes that have different types according to the space available. Experimental results based on layout of Mobile dynamic random access memory (DRAM).", "As technology development advances into deep-sub-wavelength nodes, multiple patterning is becoming more essential to achieve the technology shrink requirements. Recently, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) technology has proposed simultaneous correction of multiple mask-patterns to enable multiple patterning awareness during OPC correction. This is essential to prevent inter-layer hot-spots during the final pattern transfer. In state-of-art literature, multi-layer awareness is achieved using simultaneous resist-contour simulations to predict and correct for hot-spots during mask generation. However, this approach assumes a uniform etch shrink response for all patterns independent of their proximity, which isn\u2019t sufficient for the full prevention of inter-exposure hot-spot, for example different color space violations post etch or via coverage/enclosure post etch.\nIn this paper, we explain the need to include the etch component during multiple patterning OPC. We also introduce a novel approach for Etch-aware simultaneous Multiple-patterning OPC, where we calibrate and verify a lumped model that includes the combined resist and etch responses. Adding this extra simulation condition during OPC is suitable for full chip processing from a computation intensity point of view. Also, using this model during OPC to predict and correct inter-exposures hot-spots is similar to previously proposed multiple-patterning OPC, yet our proposed approach more accurately corrects post-etch defects too.", "Traditional model-based Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and rule-based Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET) methods have been the workhorse mask synthesis methods in volume production for logic and memory devices for more than 15 years. Rule-based OPC methods have been in standard use for over 20 years now. With continuous technical enhancements, these methods have proven themselves robust, flexible and fast enough to meet many of the technical needs of even the most advanced nodes. Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) methods are well known to have strong benefits in finding flexible mask pattern solutions to improve process window for the most advanced design locations where traditional methods are not sufficient.\nHowever, OPC/RET requirements at each node have changed radically in the last 20 years beyond just technical requirements. The volume of engineering work to be done has also skyrocketed. The number of device layers which need OPC/RET can be 10X higher than in earlier nodes. Additionally, the number of mask layers per device layer is often 2X or more times higher with multiple patterning. Finally, the number of features to correct per mask increases ~2X with each node. These factors led to a large increase in the number of OPC engineers needed to develop the complex new OPC/RET recipes for advanced nodes.\nIn this paper, we describe new developments which significantly improve the productivity of OPC engineers to deploy Rule Based OPC (RBOPC), Model Based OPC (MBOPC), AF, and ILT recipes in modern manufacturing flows. In addition to technical improvements such as novel multiple segment hotspot fixing solvers and ILT hot-spot fixing necessary to support correction needs, we have re-architected the entire flow based on how OPC engineers now develop and maintain OPC/RET recipes. The re-architecture of the flow takes advantages of more recent developments in modular and structured programming methods which are known to benefit ease engineering software development applications. Therefore, this improved OPC/RET development methodology includes specifically targeted advanced new technical functions; new types of modular structures for much faster reuse of customizations; and new interfaces to flexible programming capabilities to enable easier development and integration of deep customizations for the most challenging technical needs.", "A hybrid multi-step method for Sub-Resolution Assist Feature (SRAF) placement is presented. The process window, characterized by process variation bands (PV-bands), is subjected to optimization. By applying a state-of-the-art advanced pattern matching based approach, the SRAF placement is optimized to maximize the process window. Due to the complexity of building a complete Rule-Based SRAF (RBSRAF) solution and the performance limitation of the Model-Based SRAF solution (MBSRAF), the hybrid pattern based SRAF reduces the complexity and improves performance. In this paper, the hybrid pattern-based SRAF algorithm and its implementation, as well as testing results, are discussed with respect to process window and performance.", "As device design rule has been made pattern size shrink, LELE (Litho-Etch- Litho-Etch) process is used in advance pattern process more and more. The CD control is one of the most critical factors for semiconductor manufacturing. However, the numbers of current in-line measurement points are not sufficient for the whole wafer CD monitoring. It\u2019s the goal to increase inline monitor capacity without suffering process cycle time. To generate an innovation pattern to reach the goal is the purpose for the advance pattern process.\nThis paper is going to introduce the detection of CD variation by using overlay metrology in LELE process. The target mark was designed from AIM (Advanced Imaging Metrology) overlay mark. By placing Layer 1 and Layer 2 AIM pattern side by side, CD variation will cause related position changed. And it is able to be detected by overlay tool. On the other hand, overlay shift will not influence this model. It has an advantage over the conventional CD measurement tool. First, the overlay tool throughput is 5~10 times faster than traditional CDSEM and the measurement time is saved. Second, we are able to measure CD and overlay at the same time. Both CD/AA performances are considered and the throughput is also gained.", "Optical metrology is the workhorse metrology in manufacturing and key enabler to patterning process control. Recent advances in device architecture are gradually shifting the need for process control from the lithography module to other patterning processes (etch, trim, clean, LER/LWR treatments, etc..). Complex multi-patterning integration solutions, where the final pattern is the result of multiple process steps require a step-by-step holistic process control and a uniformly accurate holistic metrology solution for pattern transfer for the entire module. For effective process control, more process \u201cknobs\u201d are needed, and a tighter integration of metrology with process architecture.", "Multiple patterning integrations for sub 193nm lithographic resolution are becoming increasingly creative in pursuit of cost reduction and achieving desired critical dimension. Implementing these schemes into production can be a challenge. Aimed at reducing cost associated with multiple patterning for the 10nm node and beyond, we will present a self-aligned quadruple patterning strategy which uses 193nm immersion lithography resist pattern as a first mandrel and a spacer on spacer integration to enable a final pitch of 30nm. This option could be implemented for front end or back end critical layers such as Fin and Mx. Investigation of combinations of low temperature ALD films such as TiO, Al2O3 and SiO2 will be reviewed to determine the best candidates to meet the required selectivities, LER/LWR and CDs.", "For sub-10nm technologies, the semiconductor industry is facing the limits of conventional lithography to achieve narrow dimensions. DSA (Directed Self-Assembly) of Block Copolymers (BCP) is one of the most promising solutions to reach sub-10nm patterns with a high density. One challenge for DSA integration is the removal of PMMA selectively to PS. In this paper, we propose to study PMMA removal selectively to PS by screening different plasma etch chemistries. These chemistries developed on blanket wafers have been tested on cylindrical and lamellar patterned wafers.", "The need for continued device scaling along with the increasing demand for high precision have lead to the development of atomic layer etch processes in semiconductor manufacturing. We have tested this new methodology with regard to patterning applications. While these new plasma-enhanced atomic layer etch (PE-ALE) processes show encouraging results, most patterning applications are best realized by optimizations through discharge chemistry and/or plasma parameters. While PE-ALE approaches seem to have limited success for trilayer patterning applications, significant improvements were obtained when applying them to small pitch. In particular the increased selectivity to OPL seems to offer a potential benefit for patterning high aspect ratio features.", "Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) is targeted to support the sub 10nm technology nodes. It is consisted of several process steps starting with lithography and Etch to define the pattern backbone. Followed by additional set of processes based on thin-films deposition and etch that quadruple the number of patterns, shrinking pattern and pitch sizes.\nPattern roughness is derived from the physical and chemical characteristics of these process steps. It is changing with each of the SAQP process steps, based on material stack and the etch process characteristics. Relative to a sub 10 nm pattern sizes pattern, edge roughness can significantly impact pattern physical dimensions. Unless controlled it can increase the variability of device electrical performance, and reduce yield.\nIn this paper we present the SAQP process steps and roughness characterization, performed with Power Spectral Density (PSD) methodology. Experimental results demonstrates the ability of PSD analysis to sensitively reflect detailed characterization of process roughness, guiding process development improvements, and enabling roughness monitoring for production.", "Sub-nm precision is increasingly being required of many critical plasma etching processes in the semiconductor industry. Accurate control over ion energy and ion/radical composition is needed during plasma processing to meet these stringent requirements. Described in this work is a new plasma etch system which has been designed with the requirements of atomic precision plasma processing in mind. In this system, an electron sheet beam parallel to the substrate surface produces a plasma with an order of magnitude lower electron temperature Te (~ 0.3 eV) and ion energy Ei (< 3 eV without applied bias) compared to conventional radio-frequency (RF) plasma technologies. Electron beam plasmas are characterized by higher ion-to-radical fraction compared to RF plasmas, so a separate radical source is used to provide accurate control over relative ion and radical concentrations. Another important element in this plasma system is low frequency RF bias capability which allows control of ion energy in the 2-50 eV range. Presented in this work are the results of etching of a variety of materials and structures performed in this system. In addition to high selectivity and low controllable etch rate, an important requirement of atomic precision etch processes is no (or minimal) damage to the remaining material surface. It has traditionally not been possible to avoid damage in RF plasma processing systems, even during atomic layer etch. The experiments for Si etch in Cl2 based plasmas in the aforementioned etch system show that damage can be minimized if the ion energy is kept below 10 eV. Layer-by-layer etch of Si is also demonstrated in this etch system using electrical and gas pulsing.", "The directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers offers a promising route for scaling feature sizes below 20 nm. At these small dimensions, plasmas are often used to define the initial patterns. It is imperative to understand how plasmas interact with each block in order to design processes with sufficient etch contrast and pattern fidelity. Symmetric lamella forming block copolymers including, polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) and several high-\u03c7 silicon-containing and tin-containing block copolymers were synthesized, along with homopolymers of each block, and exposed to various oxidizing, reducing, and fluorine-based plasma processes. Etch rate kinetics were measured, and plasma modifications of the materials were characterized using XPS, AES, and FTIR. Mechanisms for achieving etch contrast were elucidated and were highly dependent on the block copolymer architecture. For several of the polymers, plasma photoemissions were observed to play an important role in modifying the materials and forming etch-resistant protective layers. Furthermore, it was observed for the silicon- and tin-containing polymers that an initial transient state exists, where the polymers exhibit an enhanced etch rate, prior to the formation of the etch-resistant protective layer. Plasma developed patterns were demonstrated for the differing block copolymer materials with feature sizes ranging from 20 nm down to approximately 5 nm.", "In the Global 450mm Equipment Development Consortium (G450C), a 193i guided directed self-assembly (DSA) pattern has been used to create structures at the 14nm node and below. The first guided DSA patterned wafer was ready for etch process development within a month of the G450C\u2019s first 193i patterned wafer availability with one litho pass. Etch processes were scaled up from 300mm to 450mm for a 28nm pitch STI stack and a 40nm pitch M1 BEOL stack. The effects of various process parameters were investigated to fine tune each process. Overall process window has been checked and compared. Excellent process stability results were shown for current etch chambers.", "For the first time, process impact on line-edge roughness (LER) and line-width roughness (LWR) in a back-end-of-line (BEOL) self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) flow has been systematically investigated through predictive 3D virtual fabrication. This frequency dependent LER study shows that both deposition and etching effectively reduce high frequency LER, while deposition is much more effective in reducing low frequency LER. Spacer-assisted patterning technology reduces LWR significantly by creating correlated edges, and further LWR improvement can be achieved by optimizing individual process effects on LER. Our study provides a guideline for the understanding and optimization of LER and LWR in advanced technology nodes.", "Accurate prediction of etch bias has become more important as technology node shrinks. A simulation is not feasible solution in full chip level due to excessive runtime, so etch proximity correction (EPC) often relies on empirically obtained rules or models. However, simple rules alone cannot accurately correct various pattern shapes, and a few empirical parameters in model-based EPC is still not enough to achieve satisfactory OCV. We propose a new approach of etch bias modeling through machine learning (ML) technique. A segment of interest (and its surroundings) are characterized by some geometric and optical parameters, which are received by an artificial neural network (ANN), which then outputs predicted etch bias of the segment. The ANN is used as our etch bias model for new EPC, which we propose in this paper. The new etch bias model and EPC are implemented in commercial OPC tool and demonstrated using 20nm technology DRAM gate layer.", "Directed self-assembly is a candidate process for sub-15-nm patterning applications. It will be necessary to develop the DSA process fully and consider process integration to adapt the DSA process for use in semiconductor manufacturing. We investigated the reactive ion etching (RIE) process for the fabrication of sub-10-nm metal wires using the DSA process and the process integration requirements for electrical yield verification. We evaluated the process using an organic high-chi block copolymer (BCP) with a lamellar structure. One critical issue during DSA pattern transfer involves the BCP bottom connection. The BCP bottom connections could be removed without BCP mask loss by using the optimum bias power and the optimum BCP film thickness. The sub-10-nm DSA line-and-space (L/S) patterns were successfully transferred to a SiO2 layer with sufficient film thickness for the fabrication of the metal wire. We also evaluated the overlay technique used in the process. The connect patterns and cut patterns were overlaid on 10-nm trenches fabricated by the DSA process.", "Critical back end of line (BEOL) Mx patterning at 7nm technology node and beyond requires sub-36nm pitch line/space pattern in order to meet the scaling requirements. This small pitch can be achieved by either extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography or 193nm-immersion-lithography based self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP). With enormous challenges being faced in production readiness of EUV lithography, SAQP is expected to be the front up approach for Mx grid patterning for most of industry. In contrast to the front end of line (FEOL) fin patterning, which has successfully deployed SAQP approach since 10nm node technology, BEOL Mx SAQP is challenging owing to the required usage of significantly lower temperature budgets for film stack deposition. This has an adverse impact on the material properties of the as-deposited films leading to emergence of several challenges for etch including selectivity, uniformity and roughness. In this presentation we will highlight those unique etch challenges associated with our BEOL Mx SAQP patterning strategy and summarize our efforts in optimizing the patterning stack, etch chemistries & process steps for meeting the 7nm technology node targets. We will present comparison data on both organic and in-organic mandrel stacks with respect to LER/LWR & CDU. With LER being one of the most critical targets for 7nm BEOL Mx, we will outline our actions for optimization of our stack including resist material, mandrel material, spacer material and others. Finally, we would like to update our progress on achieving the target LER of 1.5 nm for 32nm pitch BEOL SAQP pattern.", "EUV photons expose photoresists by complex interactions starting with photoionization that create primary electrons (~80 eV), followed by ionization steps that create secondary electrons (10-60 eV). Ultimately, these lower energy electrons interact with specific molecules in the resist that cause the chemical reactions which are responsible for changes in solubility. The mechanisms by which these electrons interact with resist components are key to optimizing the performance of EUV resists. An electron exposure chamber was built to probe the behavior of electrons within photoresists. Upon exposure and development of a photoresist to an electron gun, ellipsometry was used to identify the dependence of electron penetration depth and number of reactions on dose and energy. Additionally, our group has updated a robust software that uses first-principles based Monte Carlo model called \u201cLESiS\u201d, to track secondary electron production, penetration depth, and reaction mechanisms within materials-defined environments. LESiS was used to model the thickness loss experiments to validate its performance with respect to simulated electron penetration depths to inform future modeling work.", "Both fundamental measurements of resist exposure events and measurements of line-edge roughness for similar exposure latitude images for e-beam and EUV patterning tools have been used to assess the relative role of exposure shot-noise in lithographic performance. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) has been performed to quantify the probability of absorption of 100 keV electrons in two commercially available EUV resists. About 1/3 of the incident electrons lose at least 2 eV in the materials and this absorption probability is larger than that for EUV photons in the two modern EUV resists. Exposure event count densities between EUV and e-beam differ by 11-13%, which results in an expected difference in the variation in exposure shot noise of only 6%. With matched image exposure latitudes and accounting for EUV mask LER contribution the measured LER distributions indicate a high (76% and 94%) confidence that EUV resist performance is currently not dominated by exposure event counts for two leading chemically amplified EUV resists.", "Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) lithography is a next generation lithographic technique using 13.5 nm wavelength light (91.7eV photon energy) to define sub-20 nm features. This high energy radiation generates lower energy electrons (LEEs) after being absorbed. The mean free path of LEEs increases rapidly below ca. 30 eV allowing them to migrate several nanometers from their point of origin. As LEEs can still have sufficient energy to react with the surrounding resist, this may give rise to pattern blurring, posing a challenge for sub 10 nm features. Here, we introduce Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM) as an extremely useful technique to investigate the interactions of LEEs with EUV resists. Using LEEM we can expose the resist with precise electron energies and doses. We also report the initial results of LEE exposures on poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA. We have studied the LEE-PMMA interaction depth as a function of electron energy; a distinct exposure threshold is found at ~15 eV, below which the resist responds only very weakly to electron exposure.", "This paper describes the development and evolution of the critical architecture for a laser-produced-plasma (LPP) extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) source for advanced lithography applications in high volume manufacturing (HVM). In this paper we discuss the most recent results from high power sources in the field and testing on our laboratory based development systems, and describe the requirements and technical challenges related to successful implementation of those technologies on production sources. System performance is shown, focusing on pre-pulse operation with high conversion efficiency (CE) and with dose control to ensure high die yield. Finally, experimental results evaluating technologies for generating stable EUV power output for a high volume manufacturing (HVM) LPP source will be reviewed.", "We have been developing CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source which is the most promising solution as the 13.5nm high power light source for HVM EUVL. Unique and original technologies such as: combination of pulsed CO2 laser and Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser pulses shooting, and mitigation with magnetic field, have been developed in Gigaphoton Inc. The theoretical and experimental data have clearly showed the advantage of our proposed strategy. Based on these data we are developing first practical source for HVM - \u201cGL200E\u201d. This data means 250W EUV power will be able to realize around 20kW level pulsed CO2 laser. We have reported engineering data from our recent test such around 43W average clean power, CE=2.0%, with 100kHz operation and other data 19). We have already finished preparation of higher average power CO2 laser more than 20kW at output power cooperate with Mitsubishi Electric Corporation 14). Recently we achieved 92W with 50kHz, 50% duty cycle operation 20). We have reported component technology progress of EUV light source system.\nWe report promising experimental data and result of simulation of magnetic mitigation system in Proto #1 system. We demonstrated several data with Proto #2 system: (1) emission data of 140W in burst under 70kHz 50% duty cycle during 10 minutes. (2) emission data of 118W in burst under 60kHz 70% duty cycle during 10 minutes. (3) emission data of 42W in burst under 20kHz 50% duty cycle (10000pls/0.5ms OFF) during 3 hours (110Mpls). Also we report construction of Pilot #1 system. Final target is week level operation with 250W EUV power with CE=4%, more than 27kW CO2 laser power by the end of Q2 of 2015.", "Recent years have seen great strides in the development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) laser-produced plasma sources. Field deployed EUV exposure tools are now capable of facilitating advanced technology node development. Nevertheless, as the required manufacturing exposure dose scales, EUV sources must follow suit and provide 500- 1000 W to maintain production throughputs. A free-electron laser (FEL) offers a cost effective, single-source alternative for powering an entire EUV lithography program. FEL integration into semiconductor fab architecture will require both unique facility considerations as well as a paradigm shift in lithography operations. Critical accelerator configurations relating to energy recovery, multi-turn acceleration, and operational mode are discussed from engineering/scientific, cost-minimization, and safety perspectives. Furthermore, the individual components of a FEL (electron injector, RF systems, undulator, etc.) are examined with respect to both design and cost, considering existing technology as well as prospective innovations. Finally, FEL development and deployment roadmaps are presented, focusing on manufacturer deployment for the 5 nm or 3 nm technology nodes.[1-3]", "The combination of a 10.6 \u03bcm main pulse CO2 laser and a 1064 nm pre-pulse Nd:YAG laser in EUV source concepts for HVM would require collector mirrors with an integrated spectral purity filter that suppresses both laser wavelengths. This paper discusses a new approach of a dual-wavelength spectral purity filter to suppress 10.6 \u03bcm and 1064 nm IR radiation at the same time. The dual-wavelength spectral purity filter combines two binary phase gratings that are optimized for 10.6 \u03bcm and 1064 nm, respectively. The dual phase grating structure has been realized on spherical sub-aperture EUV collector mirrors having an outer diameter of 150 mm. IR suppression factors of 260 at 10.6 \u03bcm and 620 at 1064 nm have been measured on the sub-aperture EUV collector while its EUV reflectance exceeded 64 % at 13.5 nm.", "Actinic mask inspection manufactures are currently searching for high-radiance EUV sources for their tools. LDP source, which was previously used for lithography purposes, was found to be a good candidate as it can provide sufficient power and radiance. Introduction of new techniques, modified modules and fine tuning of operational conditions (discharge pulse energy, discharge frequency, laser) has brought radiance level to 180 W/mm2/sr at plasma or 145 W/mm2/sr as clean-photon. The source has been modified in such a way to improve modules reliability, lifetime and radiance stability even though there is still a room for further improvement. Size of the source system is much smaller than that of the lithography source. A debris mitigation system has been tested. Optical transmission was improved to 77 % and several 8-nm-thick Ru samples were exposed to evaluate contamination and erosion of optics. Preliminary results show low sputter and deposition rates, which supports sufficiently long lifetime of the optics.", "Light sources for extreme ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) are continued to face challenges in the demanding performance for high volume manufacture. Currently EUV and beyond EUV (BEUV) community are focused on the dual-pulse laser produced plasma (LPP) using droplets of mass-limited targets. These systems require extensive optimization to enhance the conversion efficiency (CE) and increase components lifetime that requires significant experimental and development efforts. We continued to enhance our comprehensive HEIGHTS simulation package and upgrade our CMUXE laboratories to study and optimize LPP sources and to make projections and realistic predictions of near future powerful devices. HEIGHTS package includes 3-D detail description of all physical processes involved in LPP devices. The models continued to be well benchmarked in each interaction physics phase of plasma evolution and EUV/BEUV production as well as in the integrated LPP systems. We simulated LPP sources in full 3-D geometry using Sn and Gd droplets and fragmented targets composed of microdroplets as a result of prepulse or from mist of tiny droplets distribution. We studied mass dependence, laser parameters effects, atomic and ionic debris generation, and optimization of EUV/BEUV radiation output, the requirements for mitigating systems to reduce debris effects. Our enhanced modeling and simulation include all phases of laser target evolution: from laser/droplet interaction, energy deposition, target vaporization and fragmentation, ionization, plasma hydrodynamic expansion, thermal and radiation energy redistribution, and EUV/BEUV photons collection as well as detail mapping of photons source location and size. Modeling results were benchmarked against experimental studies for the in-band photons production and for debris and ions generation.", "Ion Beam Deposition (IBD) has been the primary technique used to deposit EUV mask blanks since 1995 when it was discovered it could produce multilayers with few defects. Since that time the IBD technique has been extensively studied and improved and is finally approaching usable defectivities. But in the intervening years, the defectivity of magnetron sputtering has been greatly improved. This paper evaluates the suitability of a modern magnetron tool to produce EUV mask blanks and the ability to support HVM production. In particular we show that the reflectivity and uniformity of these tools are superior to current generation IBD tools, and that the magnetron tools can produce EUV films with defect densities comparable to recent best IBD tool performance. Magnetron tools also offer many advantages in manufacturability and tool throughput; however, challenges remain, including transitioning the magnetron tools from the wafer to mask formats. While work continues on quantifying the capability of magnetron sputtering to meet the mask blank demands of the industry, for the most part the remaining challenges do not require any fundamental improvements to existing technology. Based on the recent results and the data presented in this paper there is a clear indication that magnetron deposition should be considered for the future of EUV mask blank production.", "In this paper we compare the imaging performance of several options currently under consideration for use in 0.33 and higher numerical aperture (NA) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask stacks, Mo/Si ML reflective coatings with 40 bilayers, Ru/Si multilayer (ML) reflective coatings with 20 bilayers, and a new thinner Ni-based absorber layer on each of these mask stacks. The use of a Ru/Si ML coating with its shallower effective reflectance plane and a 2x thinner Ni-based absorber is expected to significantly reduce both shadow bias requirements and mask telecentricity errors. The conclusions of the paper are supported with the results of both experimental measurements and rigorous simulations.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) mask multi-layer (ML) blank surface roughness specification historically comes from blank defect inspection tool requirement. Later, new concerns on ML surface roughness induced wafer pattern line width roughness (LWR) arise. In this paper, we have studied wafer level pattern LWR as a function of EUVL mask surface roughness via High-NA Actinic Reticle Review Tool. We found that the blank surface roughness induced LWR at current blank roughness level is in the order of 0.5nm 3\u03c3 for NA=0.42 at the best focus. At defocus of \u00b140nm, the corresponding LWR will be 0.2nm higher. Further reducing EUVL mask blank surface roughness will increase the blank cost with limited benefit in improving the pattern LWR, provided that the intrinsic resist LWR is in the order of 1nm and above.", "A critical component of high-performance EUV lithography source optics is the reflecting multilayer coating. The ideal multilayer will have both high reflectance and high stability to thermal load. Additionally the capping layers must provide resistance to degradations from exposure to an EUV source, and also be compatible with, or enhance, the systems used for cleaning an exposed multilayer coating. We will report on the results of development of C and B4C stabilized Mo/Si multilayers used to increase the as-deposited peak reflectivity (Rp) as well as decreasing the loss of peak reflectivity (Rp) as a function of annealing temperature. Previous results demonstrate that these layers prevent loss of Rp for temperatures up to 600\u00ba C. Results on the use of reactively-sputtered oxide capping layers such as SiO2 and ZrO2 will be presented as well, along with results of exposure testing. The deposition is performed in a dual processchamber inline magnetron system, using reactive sputtering for the production of capping layers. The reflectometer and exposure apparatus at the NIST Physics Laboratory is used for evaluation of the performance. Exposure results on the resistance to oxidation in the presence of water vapor will be presented and discussed.", "EUV lithography is needed by the semiconductor industry for both its resolution and for the process simplification it provides compared to multiple patterning. However it needs innovations to make it a success. One area where innovation is needed is resist performance. Resists that are commercially available for EUV use are typically based on conventional chemically amplified resist chemistry. So far, this has not provided the required performance at fast enough photo speed. Many innovative resist systems have been introduced in the last few years that have novel mechanisms and/or incorporate novel chemical elements with high EUV absorbance. These new systems are promising enough for EUV use that work on many of them now needs to shift to characterizing their functional parameters and optimizing their performance. For the future, new systems beyond these will have to focus on reducing the inherent noise in resist imaging. The concept of pixelated resists is introduced and it is suggested pixelated resists are one possible avenue for imaging sub 10nm features with sufficient feature size and profile control.", "Stochastic noise has strong impact on local variability such as LWR (Line Width Roughness), LCDU (Local Critical Dimension Uniformity) and LPE (Local Placement Error), and it is basically originated from the particle nature of photon. Statistical uncertainties of particles, same as the stochastic noises, can be analytically calculated by considering aerial image as a probability density function of photons. Contact-hole is the best pattern for counting its photon, so LCDU of contact-hole array is estimated and compared with experimental results. Among several possible statistical events from mask to resist pattern, three independent events of aerial image formation, photon absorption in resist, and chemical reaction including acid generation are considered to predict stochastic noise for both EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet) and ArF immersion lithography.", "Manipulation of dissolution properties by changing organic solvent developer and rinse material provides a novel technology to obtain fine pattern beyond the limitation of imaging system based on alkaline developer. QCM study showed no swelling character in negative-tone imaging (NTI) process even for current developer of n-butyl acetate (nBA). Actually, NTI process has shown advantages on resolution and line-width roughness (LWR) in loose pitch around 30 ~ 45 nm hp as a consequence of its non-swelling character. On the other hand, bridge and collapse limited its resolution below 20 nm hp, indicating that non-negligible amount of swelling still exists for tight pitch resolution. We investigated effects of solubility parameter of organic solvents on resolution below 20 nm hp. A bridge was reduced with a decrease in the solubility parameter dp from nBA. On the other hand, much lower dp caused film remaining due to its extremely slow Rmax. Based on these results, we newly developed FN-DP301 containing organic solvent with smaller dp than nBA. Although rinse solvent gave negligible effects on bridge, there is a clear improvement on pattern collapse only in case of using new rinse solvent of FN-RP311. Lithographic performances of NTI process using nBA and FN-DP301 together with the other organic solvents were described in this paper under exposures with an E-beam and a EUV light. It is emphasized that 14 nm hp resolution was obtained only using FN-DP301 as a developer and FN-RP311 as a rinse under E-beam exposure. NTI showed 43% faster photospeed in comparison with PTI at 16 nm hp, indicating that NTI is applicable to obtain high throughput with maintaining resolution. In addition, sub-20 nm trench was obtained using NTI without bridge under EUV exposure, all of which are attributed to the low swelling character of NTI process. Similarly, NTI was able to print 20 nm dots using NXE:3100 with only a little peeling. Conversely CH patterning was significantly worse with NTI compared to PTI, that is, only 36 nm contacts with 60 nm pitch was resolved under EUV exposure.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is the most promising candidate for the high-volume production of semiconductor devices with half-pitches of sub 10nm. An anion-bound polymer(ABP), in which at the anion part of onium salts is polymerized, has attracted much attention from the viewpoint of the control of acid diffusion. In this study, the acid generation mechanism in ABP films was investigated using \u03b3 and EUV radiolysis. On the basis of experimental results, the acid generation mechanism in anion-bound chemically amplified resists was proposed. The protons of acids are considered to be mainly generated through the reaction of phenyl radicals with diphenylsulfide radical cations that are produced through the hole transfer to the decomposition products of onium salts.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has emerged as a promising candidate for the manufacturing of semiconductor devices at the sub-14nm half pitch lines and spaces (LS) pattern for 7 nm node and beyond. The success of EUV lithography for the high volume manufacturing of semiconductor devices depends on the availability of suitable resist with high resolution and sensitivity. It is well-known that the key challenge for EUV resist is the simultaneous requirement of ultrahigh resolution (R), low line edge roughness (L) and high sensitivity (S). In this paper, we investigated and developed new chemically amplified resist (CAR) materials to achieve sub-14 nm hp resolution. We found that both resolution and sensitivity were improved simultaneously by controlling acid diffusion length and efficiency of acid generation using novel PAG and sensitizer. EUV lithography evaluation results obtained for new CAR on Micro Exposure Tool (MET) and NXE3300 system are described and the fundamentals are discussed.", "The availability of defect-free masks is considered to be a critical issue for enabling extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) as the next generation technology. Since completely defect-free masks will be hard to achieve, it is essential to have a good understanding of the printability of the native EUV mask defects. In this work, we performed a systematic study of native mask defects to understand the defect printability caused by them. The multilayer growth over native substrate mask blank defects was correlated to the multilayer growth over regular-shaped defects having similar profiles in terms of their width and height. To model the multilayer growth over the defects, a novel level-set multilayer growth model was used that took into account the tool deposition conditions of the Veeco Nexus ion beam deposition tool. The same tool was used for performing the actual deposition of the multilayer stack over the characterized native defects, thus ensuring a fair comparison between the actual multilayer growth over native defects, and modeled multilayer growth over regular-shaped defects. Further, the printability of the characterized native defects was studied with the SEMATECH-Berkeley Actinic Inspection Tool (AIT), an EUV mask-imaging microscope at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Printability of the modeled regular-shaped defects, which were propagated up the multilayer stack using level-set growth model was studied using defect printability simulations implementing the waveguide algorithm. Good comparison was observed between AIT and the simulation results, thus demonstrating that multilayer growth over a defect is primarily a function of a defect\u2019s width and height, irrespective of its shape. This would allow us to predict printability of the arbitrarily-shaped native EUV mask defects in a systematic and robust manner.", "EUV lithography is one of the main candidates for enabling the next generation of devices, primarily by enabling a lithography process that reduces complexity, and eventually, cost. IBM has installed the latest tool sets at the IBM EUV Center of Excellence in Albany to accelerate EUV lithography development for production use. Though the EUV cluster is capable of enabling the pitch requirements for the 7nm node, the dimensions in question represent a new regime in defectivity. Additionally, new classes of patterning materials are being explored, for which there is very little known up-front regarding known defect mechanisms. We will discuss the baseline cluster performance and the improvement strategy in terms of defectivity and pattern collapse in this paper by utilizing coater/developer techniques based on the new platform.", "In this paper, we will present the experimental comparison results on contact holes (CHs) and pillars patterning in EUV lithography with several candidate processes. Firstly, we have compared the normalized image log-slope (NILS), local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) and dose-to-size (DtS) with respect to positive tone imaging (PTI) and negative tone imaging (NTI) process by EUV stochastic simulation. From the simulation results, we found that NTI process has higher absorbed photon density that can reduce the DtS and the LCDU of pillars pattern is improved with higher NILS compared to CHs patterning with similar DtS. So we have experimentally evaluated the pillars patterning process with 0.25NA EUV scanner system and compared the process margin, LCDU and DtS with the same parameters of the CHs pattering process. Further, we have demonstrated the CHs patterning with reverse process from pillars by using the dry development rinse process (DDRP). Different to the simulation results, the experimental LCDU results of pillars pattern and CHs pattern by DDRP show worse values comparing with the reference resist CHs pattern. In order to analyze these results, we have investigated the effect of flare, target CD, PR thickness and mask stack of the experimental conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the pillar patterning with NTD resist and by DDRP.", "The successful demonstration of 637 wafer exposures in 24 hours on the EUV scanner at the IBM EUV Center for Excellence in July marked the transition from research to process development using EUV lithography. Early process development on a new tool involves significant characterization, as it is necessary to benchmark tool performance and process capability. This work highlights some key learning from early EUV process development with a focus on identifying the largest sources of variability for trench and via hole patterning through the patterning process. The EUV scanner demonstrated stable overlay on a 40 lot test run using integrated wafers. The within field and local critical dimension uniformity (CDU) are the largest contributors to CD variations. The line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) in EUV resist will be compared to the post etch value to determine the effect of processing. While these numbers are generally used to describe the robustness of 1D trenches or circular vias, the need to accurately evaluate the printability of irregular 2D features has become increasingly important. In the past 5 years, models built from critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CDSEM) contours has become a hot topic in computational lithography. Applying this methodology, the CDSEM contour technique will be used to assess the uniformity of these irregular patterns in EUV resist and after etching. CDSEM contours also have additional benefits for via pattern characterization.", "The introduction of EUV lithography will happen at a critical feature pitch which corresponds to a k1 factor of roughly 0.45. While this number seems not very aggressive compared to recent ArF lithography nodes, the number is sufficiently low that the introduction of assist features has to be considered. While the small NA makes the k1 factor larger, the depth of focus still needs to be scaled down with wavelength. However the exposure tool's focus control is not greatly improved over the ArF tools, so other solutions to improve the depth of focus, e.g. SRAFs, are needed. On the other hand, sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) require very small mask dimensions, which make masks more costly to write and inspect. Another disadvantage of SRAFs is the fact that they may cause pattern-dependent best focus shift due to thick mask effects. Those effects can be predicted, but the shift of best focus and the associated tilt of Bossung curves make the process more difficult to control. We investigate the impact of SRAFs on printing in EUV lithography and evaluate advantages and disadvantages. By using image quality parameters such as best focus (BF), and depth of focus (DOF), respectively with and without SRAFs, we will answer the question if we can gain a net benefit for 1D and 2D patterns by adding SRAFs. SRAFs will only be introduced if any net improvement in process variation (PV) outweighs the additional expense of assist patterning on the mask. In this paper, we investigate the difference in printing behavior of symmetric and asymmetric SRAF placement and whether through slit effect needs to be considered in SRAF placement for EUV lithography.", "In this paper, rigorous simulation is used to explore the limits of high-NA EUV lithography for printing real circuits containing 1D and 2D patterns. First, a new, non-conforming mesh pseudo-spectral time-domain formulation suitable for simulating complicated EUV mask layouts is described. Then, an exact mathematical explanation of the waveguide effect in high-NA EUV lithography is presented. This effect serves to overcome much of the problem of shadowing in high-NA EUV lithography. Next, the printing of a DRAM circuit with 4-nm feature size using optical proximity correction and single exposure is demonstrated. Finally, the possibility of printing a SRAM circuit with 4-nm feature size using single exposure is discussed.", "We have performed a systematic study regarding the diblock composition to keep the size of the cylinders relatively constant despite the shape of the guiding pattern. We have also explored how some guiding patterns shapes provide acceptable cylindrical assembly using an EUV exposure system. This study assumes that LER is a random phenomenon which conformably follows the shape of the guiding pattern. While the edges of the guiding pattern have fluctuations related to the LER of the EUV resist, as long as the centroid of the guiding pattern remains constant, the rectification characteristics of DSA permits adequate hole formation. In this paper we include the level of LER a guiding pattern can exhibit given a pre-determined diblock copolymer / homopolymer mixture. As the amount of homopolymer increases, the size and placement of the assembled diblock becomes less sensitive to the guiding pattern\u2019s edge roughness. This study also explores how the addition of homopolymer is only effective up to a point, as a homopolymer-rich blend is not able to assemble properly. One of the concerns about homopolymer-rich mixtures is the effect it has in the formation of defects. Such effect has not been fully characterized but this study serves as the basis for testing optimal combinations of materials and lithography settings for an EUV system, with the end goal to enable contact/via printing at lower EUV source power requirements.", "The best focus shift due to thick mask effects is well known, both in ArF, and more importantly in EUV, where the shorter wavelength is small compared to both mask openings and absorber height. While the effect is stronger in opaque features in clear field masks, the best focus shift is visible in dark field masks as well, and it becomes even more pronounced when scattering bars are added to non-dense features. This pattern dependent focus variation can be predicted in both exact EMF simulations and fast image calculations that are used for optical proximity correction (OPC). Even though this focus shift can be predicted and patterns can be corrected in OPC, we would like to understand the mechanism that causes this focus shift. This can help us understand if, in addition to best focus shift, the image quality is further deteriorated due to the thick mask effects. The best focus shift is found to be an interplay of the complex diffraction coefficient due to thick mask effects and the direction of the light that is incident on the mask, or coherence value \u03c3. A change in focus adds a phase term to each of the complex diffraction coefficients, causing their rotation in a phasor diagram. Best focus is found when the phasors have an angle of 0 or 180 degrees to each other and depending on which diffracted orders are caught in the pupil and contribute to imaging. We investigate the effect of partial coherence, mask thickness, and assist feature placement on best focus shift. We observe a waveguide effect in the absorber gaps because of the reduced real index of refraction in the absorber layer, making vacuum the optically dense medium. We suggest ways to lessen the best focus shifts through assist feature placement or the use of alternative absorbers that are closer matched to the dielectric index of vacuum.", "Due to the use of reflective optics in extreme-ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), the chief ray angle of incidence at the object (mask) side (CRAO) cannot be zero. If the conventional resolution enhancement technique (RET) of off-axis illumination (OAI) is used, such mask-side non-telecentricity degrades aerial image contrast partly because of asymmetry (w.r.t. the mask) of the two beams in an incident beam pair and partly because of asymmetry (w.r.t. the mask) of the two diffraction orders of either incident beam. The former leads to intensity imbalance of the two incident beams (after leaving the mask) and the latter leads to amplitude and phase imbalance of the two diffraction orders of either incident beam. Solutions proposed previously only alleviate the former and have little help for the latter. In this paper, we introduce n=1 absorber to eliminate the phase imbalance so that the transverse shift between the two aerial images formed by the two incident beams can be minimized and the contrast of the final aerial image (by superposition of the two) can be restored.", "Monte Carlo simulations are used in the semiconductor industry to evaluate variability limits in design rule generation, commonly for interaction between different layers. The variability of the geometry analyzed is determined mainly by the lithography, process and OPC used. Monte Carlo methods for design rule evaluation can provide the requisite level of accuracy, and are suitable for two or more layer interactions because the variations on one can be assumed to be independent of variations on the other(s). The variability parameters and budget utilized in optical Monte Carlo simulations is well-established. With the upcoming implementation of EUV lithography the variability budget will be impacted. EUV has an off-axis illumination angle that complicates the lithography process by causing telecentricity and shadowing errors. Telecentricity errors manifest as a printed feature being shifted relative to the design. The amount the feature is shifted is a function of the pattern density and design. Shadowing is caused by the 3D nature of the mask combined with EUV reflective mask technology. A shadow occurs at feature edges, where the source does not fully illuminate. Telecentricity and shadowing errors, although small at the 10 nm node, will increase in relative size compared to the features printed beyond the 7 nm node. Telecentricity and shadowing errors are complex in nature and can\u2019t be compensated for with a flat bias. These errors unique to EUV are incorporated into Monte Carlo simulations and evaluated against the standard cell design layers. The effect of these variability parameters is evaluated on critical 7 nm node layout clips.", "The suppression of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresist-related outgassing is one of the challenges in high-volume manufacturing with EUV lithography (EUVL), because it contributes to the contamination of the EUV scanner mirror optics, resulting in reflectivity loss. Witness sample pragmatic outgas qualification has been developed into the general method for clarifying commercially available, chemically amplified resists. Preliminary results have suggested a linear correlation between contamination thickness in the electron-beam-based and the EUV-based evaluation systems. In fact, a positive relationship was observed between contamination thickness and exposure dose. However, recent experiments indicate that in some resists, this relationship is not linear. In the present study, a resist outgas model is proposed and tested to investigate the contamination thickness\u2019 dependency on exposure dose. The model successfully explains the experimental outgas phenomenon. It is estimated that increasing exposure dose, in resists with low activation energies (Ea) in deprotection reactions, results in extreme increase in contamination thickness. Furthermore, the low-Ea resists have high contamination risk when exposure is extensive.", "In this paper, we present the first results of witness sample based outgas resist family test to improve the efficiency of outgas testing using EUV resists that have shown proven imaging performance. The concept of resist family testing is to characterize the boundary conditions of outgassing scale from three major components for each resist family. This achievement can significantly reduce the cost and improve the resist outgas learning cycle. We also report the imaging performance and outgas test results of state of the art resists and discuss the consequence of the resist development with recent change of resist outgassing specifications. Three chemically amplified resists selected from higher outgassing materials are investigated, but no significant improvement in resist performance is observed.", "This paper reports on an all-out effort to reduce the intersite gap of the resist outgassing contamination growth in the results obtained under the round-robin scheme. All test sites collaborated to determine the causes of such gaps. First, it was determined that wafer temperature during exposure could impact the amount of contamination growth. We discovered a huge intersite gap of wafer temperatures among the sites by using a wafer-shaped remote thermometer with wireless transmitting capability. Second, whether the contamination-limited regime was attained during testing could have been another primary root cause for such a difference. We found that for one of the model resists whose protecting unit had lower activation energy and molecular weight the contamination-limited regime was insufficient at one test site. Third, the ratio of the exposed area to pumping speed is necessary to equalize contamination growth. We validated the effect of matching the ratio of exposure area to pumping speed on reducing the intersite gap. This study and the protocols put in place should reduce the intersite gap dramatically.", "After having developed metrology with synchrotron radiation at the storage rings BESSY I and BESSY II for more than 25 years, particularly also for the characterization of EUV optical components and detectors, PTB extended its capabilities for EUV metrology with respect to polarization resolved measurements, particularly in the spectral region around 13.5 nm. With the development of larger numerical aperture optics for EUV and advanced illumination concepts for lithographic imaging, the polarization performance of the optical elements and EUV photomasks with respect to high-NA EUV imaging becomes ever more important. At PTB, we use monochromatized bending magnet radiation for the characterization of the optical elements because of the superior temporal stability and rapid tuneability of the wavelength. Thus the polarization of the radiation is almost linear, depending on the vertical beamline acceptance angle, and cannot be manipulated. Therefore, we decided to equip the soft X-ray beamline which delivers particularly well collimated and highly linearly polarized radiation with a sample manipulator which allows freely setting the orientation of the plane of deflection. Thus we are able to characterize samples in any orientation with respect to the linear polarized direction. We additionally can add a linear polarization analyzer working with a rotatable Brewster reflector to analyze the state of polarization of the reflected beam.\nWe present first results on the polarization properties of EUV multilayer mirrors close to the Brewster angle where polarization selectivity up to s104 is predicted from model calculations. We also present polarization resolved measurements of the EUV diffraction of absorber line patterns at EUV photomasks.", "We present a method to extract aberrations from through-focus aerial images of mask roughness on an Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography mask. The algorithm uses a phase recovery algorithm based on the Weak Object Transfer Function to recover the phase and amplitude of the roughness, while considering aberrations and partially coherent illumination. Using the self-consistency of the recovered object, aberrations, and measured images as a metric, we optimize over the space of aberrations to estimate aberrations. Partially coherent illumination is needed to allow the effects of the object field and aberrations to be separated. We apply the algorithm to the EUV aerial image microscope, SHARP, using a parameterized ray tracing model to calculate the aberrations from a lower dimensional parameter space.", "We present an approach to image-based EUV aberration metrology using binary mask targets and iterative model-based solutions to extract both the amplitude and phase components of the aberrated pupil function. The approach is enabled through previously developed modeling, fitting, and extraction algorithms. We examine the flexibility and criticality of the method using two experimental case studies. The first extracts the pupil phase behavior from an ASML NXE:3100 exposure system and shows primary aberration sensitivity below 0.2 m\u03bb. The second experiment extracts both components of the pupil function from the SHARP EUV microscope.", "One challenge of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask defectivity is the severe printability of defects of the multi-layer (ML) mirror on the mask. These ML-defects are just nanometer high or deep local distortions of this ML mirror. Dedicated blank inspection tools have become available over time. One of them is the actinic blank inspection tool under development through EIDEC (Lasertec ABI). EIDEC and imec have jointly correlated its blank defect detection capability to wafers printed on ASML NXE3100 and NXE3300 scanners. Printing ML-defects were identified by wafer inspection, followed by subsequent repeater analysis, and correlated back to blank inspection. Forward correlation of ABI detections to the printed wafer was also successfully undertaken. The focus of this work has been on native defects. This paper will discuss the obtained results from the perspective of how to use ABI to assess which kind of native ML defects need to be avoided during blank fabrication.", "Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography mask defects were examined on the actinic mask imaging system, SHARP, at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. A quantitative phase retrieval algorithm based on the Weak Object Transfer Function was applied to the measured through-focus aerial images to examine the amplitude and phase of the defects. The accuracy of the algorithm was demonstrated by comparing the results of measurements using a phase contrast zone plate and a standard zone plate. Using partially coherent illumination to measure frequencies that would otherwise fall outside the numerical aperture (NA), it was shown that some defects are smaller than the conventional resolution of the microscope. Programmed defects of various sizes were measured and shown to have both an amplitude and a phase component that the algorithm is able to recover.", "This paper proposes a new method for the characterization of multilayer defects of EUV masks. The method uses measured or simulated EUV projection images at different focus positions. The Transport of Intensity Equation (TIE) is applied to retrieve the phase distribution of the reflected light in the vicinity of the defect. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is applied to correlate the optical properties of the intensity and recovered phase of the defect with the defect geometry parameters and to reconstruct the defect geometry parameters from though-focus-images of unknown defects.", "The EUV mask infrastructure is of key importance for the successful introduction of EUV lithography into volume production. In particular, for the production of defect free masks an actinic review of potential defect sites is required. To realize such an actinic review tool, Carl Zeiss and the SEMATECH EUVL Mask Infrastructure consortium started a development program for an EUV aerial image metrology system, the AIMS\u2122 EUV. In this paper, we discuss the current status of the prototype integration and show recent results.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) microscopy is invaluable for the development of EUV photomasks, providing detailed information for the creation of new mask processes, and reliable feedback for comparison with printing studies. The SHARP microscope at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is dedicated to photomask research. It was developed with forward-looking specifications that make it well suited to the emulation of current EUV lithography tools and a variety of possible future directions. Some recent examples include (1) the demonstration of imaging with 4x numerical aperture values up to 0.625, measuring patterns with feature sizes down to 30-nm half-pitch, created with a tin-based photoresist serving as the absorber. (2) The emulation of complex, free-form illuminators used in source-mask optimization, including grayscale pupil fills. (3) Point by point phase measurement from aerial image measurements using several techniques. (4) Direct observation of non-telecentric, through-focus imaging effects that arise from the angular-dependence of the mask\u2019s multilayer coating properties. In addition, we are preparing to extend SHARP imaging to include anamorphic optics, an emerging area of EUV lithography research.", "Availability of defect-free reflective mask has been one of the most critical challenges to extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). To mitigate the risk, significant progress has been made on defect detection, pattern shifting, and defect repair. Clearly such mitigation strategies are based on the assumption that defect counts and sizes from incoming mask blanks must be below practical levels depending on mask specifics. The leading industry consensus for early mask product development is that there should be no defects greater than 80 nm in the quality area, 132 mm x 132 mm. In addition less than 10 defects smaller than 80 nm may be mitigable. SEMATECH has been focused on EUV mask blank defect reduction using Veeco Nexus TM IBD platform, the industry standard for mask blank production, and assessing if IBD technology can be evolved to a manufacturing solution. SEMATECH has recently announced a breakthrough reduction of defects in the mask blank deposition process resulting in the production of two defect-free EUV mask blanks at 54 nm inspection sensitivity (SiO2 equivalent). This paper will discuss the dramatic reduction of baseline EUV mask blank defects, review the current deposition process run and compare results with previous process runs. Likely causes of remaining defects will be discussed based on analyses as characterized by their compositions and whether defects are embedded in the multilayer stack or non-embedded.", "In this paper, we present an experimental verification of Zernike phase contrast enhanced EUV multilayer (ML) blank defect detection using the SHARP EUV microscope. A programmed defect as small as 0.35 nm in height is detected at focus with signal to noise ratio (SNR) up to 8. Also, a direct comparison of the through-focus image behavior between bright field and Zernike phase contrast for ML defects ranging from 40 nm to 75 nm in width on the substrate is presented. Results show the advantages of using the Zernike phase contrast method even for defects with both phase and absorption components including a native defect. The impact of pupil apodization combined with Zernike phase contrast is also demonstrated, showing improved SNR is due to the stronger reduction of roughness dependent noise than defect signal, confirming our previous simulation results. Finally we directly compare Zernike phase contrast, dark field and bright field microscopes.", "The detection of EUV mask adder defects has been investigated with an optical wafer defect inspection system employing a methodology termed Die-to-\u201cgolden\u201d Virtual Reference Die (D2VRD). Both opaque and clear type mask absorber programmed defects were inspected and characterized over a range of defect sizes, down to (4x mask) 40 nm. The D2VRD inspection system was capable of identifying the corresponding wafer print defects down to the limit of the defect printability threshold at approximately 30 nm (1x wafer). The efficacy of the D2VRD scheme on full chip wafer inspection to suppress random process defects and identify real mask defects is demonstrated. Using defect repeater analysis and patch image classification of both the reference die and the scanned die enables the unambiguous identification of mask adder defects.", "We demonstrate numerically that oblique off-axis illumination could enhance the contrast and extend the depth of focus of EUV phase defects detection. In addition to quantitative observation, it also allows us to extract the resolution-limited defect phase profiles quantitatively. This scheme can be easily implemented in both full field and scanning mask inspection tools.", "EUV lithography for resolutions below 8 nm half pitch requires the numerical aperture (NA) of the projection lens to be significantly larger than the current state-of-the-art 0.33NA. In order to be economically viable, a throughput in the range of 100 wafers per hour is needed. As a result of the increased NA, the incidence angles of the light rays at the mask increase significantly. Consequently the shadowing deteriorates the aerial image contrast to unacceptably low values at the current 4x magnification. The only solution to reduce the angular range at the mask is to increase the magnification. Simulations show that we have to double the magnification to 8x in order to overcome the shadowing effects. Assuming that the mask infrastructure will not change the mask form factor, this would inevitably lead to a field size that is a quarter of the field size of current 0.33NA step and scan systems. This would reduce the throughput of the high-NA scanner to a value significantly below 100 wafers per hour unless additional measures are taken. This paper presents an anamorphic step and scan system capable to print fields that are half the field size of the current full field. The anamorphic system has the potential to achieve a throughput in excess of 150 wafers per hour by increasing the transmission of the optics as well as increasing the acceleration of the wafer- and mask stage. This makes it an economically viable lithography solution. Furthermore, the simulated imaging behavior of the system is demonstrated and its impact on the rest of the lithographic system is discussed.", "EUV lithography for resolution below 9 nm requires the numerical aperture of the projection optics to be significantly larger than 0.45. A configuration of 4x magnification, full field size and 6\u2019\u2019 reticle is not feasible anymore. The increased chief ray angle and higher NA at reticle lead to non-acceptable shadowing effects, which can only be controlled by increasing the magnification, hence reducing the system productivity. We demonstrate that the best compromise in imaging, productivity and field split is a so-called anamorphic magnification and a half field of 26 x 16.5 mm\u00b2. We discuss the optical solutions for anamorphic high-NA lithography.", "New design solutions are available for high-NA EUV optics, maintaining simultaneously superior imaging performance and productivity below 9nm resolution by means of anamorphic imaging. We investigate the imaging properties of these new optics configurations by rigorous simulations, taking into account mask induced effects as well as characteristics of the new optics. We compare the imaging behavior to other, more traditional optics configurations, and show that the productivity gain of our new configurations is indeed obtained at excellent imaging performance.", "Due to the exponential growth of mobile wireless devices, low-power logic chips continue to drive device scaling. To enable sub-10 nm device scaling at an affordable cost, there is a strong need for single exposure advanced lithography. Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is one of the most promising candidates to support the design rules for sub-10 nm. The aggressive mobile device design rules continue to push the critical dimension (CD) and pitch and put very stringent demands on the lithography performance such as pattern placement control, image contrast, critical dimension uniformity (CDU), and line width roughness (LWR). In this paper we report the latest advances in resolution enhancement techniques to address low k1 challenges in EUV lithography, specifically: minimizing the pattern placement error, enhancing the through-focus contrast, and reducing the impact of stochastic effects. We have developed an innovative source-mask optimization (SMO) method to significantly reduce edge placement errors (EPE) [1] [2]. Aggressive design rules using the state-of-the-art NA of 0.33 of the NXE:3300B and its successor tools can have imaging below k1 = 0.4, which can extend the current process capabilities for single exposure high volume manufacturing (HVM). Burkhardt et al. reported in a previous study that inserting a sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF) within semi-isolated features introduces strong Bossung tilts and best focus shifts, and a general solution for random pitches is not apparent [3]. Kang observed the same issues and proposed to introduce spherical aberrations to correct these effects while having a global impact on the full-chip [4]. In this work we introduce a new methodology to apply SRAFs to improve contrast, reduce best focus shift, and improve process window. Finally, the lower number of photons of EUV and the small feature size brings serious issue of the stochastic effect that causes the line-edge-roughness (LER) and local CD uniformity (LCDU). Source power, photoresist, mask bias, and feature size all impact the stochastic effects that can result in large LER for low-k1 patterning. We incorporate an empirical LER model in the SMO NXE frame work to study how the pupil, mask, dose, and target CD can be optimized to reduce stochastic edge placement errors (SEPE). We believe that these advanced EUV RET techniques can support imaging k1 below 0.4 and extend single exposure for an NA of 0.33, as is used in the NXE:3300B and its successor tools.", "Characterizing and removing optical aberrations remains a key part of achieving ultimate resolution in EUV exposure tools. Common-path approaches such as lateral shearing interferometry (LSI) have had success at moderate numerical apertures (NA \u2248 0:3); however, these techniques run into several obstacles when applied at higher NA (NA > 0:4). Chief among these obstacles are systematic aberrations due to high incident angles on the diffraction grating and non-planar Talbot surfaces that create regions of low fringe contrast across the pupil. In this paper, we present strategies for addressing these obstacles to extend LSI to high numerical apertures. These strategies will be employed in the installation and alignment of the 0.5-NA SEMATECH Berkeley Microfield Exposure Tool (MET5).", "Beyond EUV lithography at 6.X nm wavelength has a potential to extend EUVL beyond the 11 nm node. To implement B-based mirrors and to enable their industrial application in lithography tools, a reflectivity level of > 70% has to be reached in near future. The authors will prove that transition from conventional La/B4C to promising LaN/B4C multilayer coatings leads to enhanced optical properties. Currently a near normal-incidence reflectivity of 58.1% @ 6.65 nm is achieved by LaN/B4C multilayer mirrors. The introduction of ultrathin diffusion barriers into the multilayer design to reach the targeted reflectivity of 70% was also tested. The optimization of multilayer design and deposition process for interface-engineered La/C/B4C multilayer mirrors resulted in peak reflectivity of 56.8% at the wavelength of 6.66 nm. In addition, the thermal stability of several selected multilayers was investigated and will be discussed.", "As EUV lithography moves toward high-volume manufacturing (HVM), a key need for the lithography materials makers is access to EUV photons and imaging. The SEMATECH Resist Materials Development Center (RMDC) provided a solution path by enabling the Resist and Materials companies to work together (using SUNY Polytechnic Institute\u2019s Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (SUNY Poly CNSE) -based exposure systems), in a consortium fashion, in order to address the need for EUV photons. Thousands of wafers have been processed by the RMDC (leveraging the SUNY Poly CNSE/SEMATECH MET, SUNY Poly CNSE Alpha Demo Tool (ADT) and the SEMATECH Lawrence Berkeley MET) allowing many of the questions associated with EUV materials development to be answered. In this regard the activities associated with the RMDC are continuing. As the major Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) have continued to purchase EUV scanners, Materials companies must now provide scanner based test data that characterizes the lithography materials they are producing. SUNY Poly CNSE and SEMATECH have partnered to evolve the RMDC into \u201cThe Patterning Center of Excellence (CoE)\u201d. The new CoE leverages the capability of the SUNY Poly CNSE-based full field ASML 3300 EUV scanner and combines that capability with EUV Microexposure (MET) systems resident in the SEMATECH RMDC to create an integrated lithography model which will allow materials companies to advance materials development in ways not previously possible.", "The cleaning requirements for EUV masks are more complex than optical masks due to the absence of available EUVcompatible pellicles. EUV masks must therefore be capable of undergoing more than 100 cleaning cycles with minimum impact to lithographic performance. EUV masks are created on substrates with 40 multilayers of silicon and molybdenum to form a Bragg reflector, capped with a 2.5nm-thick ruthenium layer and a tantalum-based absorber; during usage, both ruthenium and absorber are exposed to the cleaning process. The CrN layer on the backside is used to enable electrostatic clamping. This clamp side must also be free of particles that could impact printing and overlay, and particles could also potentially migrate to the frontside and create defects. Thus, the cleaning process must provide decent particle removal efficiencies on both front- and backside while maintaining reflectivity with minimal surface roughness change. In this paper, we report progress developing a concurrent patterned-side and clamped-side cleaning process that achieves minimal reflectivity change over 120 cleaning cycles, with XPS and EDS indicating the presence of ruthenium after 125 cleaning cycles. The change in surface roughness over 100 cleaning cycles is within the noise (0.0086nm) on a mask blank, and SEM inspection of 100nm and 200nm features on patterned masks after undergoing 100 cleaning cycles show no indications of ruthenium pitting or significant surface damage. This process was used on test masks to remove particles from both sides that would otherwise inhibit these masks from being used in the scanner.", "Moore's Law (Moore's Observation) has been driving the progress in semiconductor technology for the past 50 years. The semiconductor industry is at a juncture where significant increase in manufacturing cost is foreseen to sustain the past trend of dimensional scaling. At N10 and N7 technology nodes, the industry is struggling to find a cost-friendly solution. At a device level, technologists have come up with novel devices (finFET, Gate-All-Around), material innovations (SiGe, Ge) to boost performance and reduce power consumption. On the other hand, from the patterning side, the relative slow ramp-up of alternative lithography technologies like EUVL and DSA pushes the industry to adopt a severely multi-patterning-based solution. Both of these technological transformations have a big impact on die yield and eventually die cost. This paper is aimed to analyze the impact on manufacturing cost to keep the Moore\u2019s law alive. We have proposed and analyzed various patterning schemes that can enable cost-friendly scaling. We evaluated the impact of EUVL introduction on tackling the high cost of manufacturing. The primary objective of this paper is to maintain Moore\u2019s scaling from a patterning perspective and analyzing EUV lithography introduction at a die level.", "The out-of-band (OoB) radiation that can cause serious aerial image deformation on the wafer is reported. In order to check the maximum allowable OoB radiation reflectivity at the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) pellicle, we simulated the effect of OoB radiation and found that the maximum allowable OoB radiation reflectivity at the pellicle should be smaller than 15 % which satisfy our criteria such as aerial image critical dimension (CD), contrast, and normalized image log slope (NILS). We suggested a new multi-stack EUV pellicle that can have high EUV transmission, minimal OoB radiation reflectivity, and enough deep ultra-violet transmission for inspection and alignment of the mask through the EUV pellicle.", "Multiple NXE:3300 are operational at customer sites. These systems, equipped with a Numerical Aperture (NA) of 0.33, are being used by semiconductor manufacturers to support device development. Full Wafer Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU) of 1.0 nm for 16nm dense lines and 1.1 nm for 20nm isolated space and stable matched overlay performance with ArF immersion scanner of less than 4nm provide the required lithographic performance for these device development activities. Steady progresses in source power have been achieved in the last 12 months, with 100Watts (W) EUV power capability demonstrated on multiple machines. Power levels up to 90W have been achieved on a customer machine, while 110W capability has been demonstrated in the ASML factory. Most NXE:3300 installed at customers have demonstrated the capability to expose 500 wafers per day, and one field system upgraded to the 80W configuration has proven capable of exposing 1,000 wafers per day. Scanner defectivity keeps being reduced by a 10x factor each year, while the first exposures obtained with full size EUV pellicles show no appreciable difference in CDU when compared to exposures done without pellicle. The 4th generation EUV system, the NXE: 3350, is being qualified in the ASML factory.", "In this paper we discuss edge placement error (EPE) for multi-patterning application and compare the EPE budget with the one for EUV single expose application case. These two patterning methods are candidate for the manufacturing of 10-nm and 7-nm logic semiconductor devices. EUV will enable 2D random pattern layout, while in the multi-patterning case a more restricted 1D design layout is needed. For the 1D design approach we discuss the patterning control spacer pitch division resulting in complex multi-layer alignment and EPE optimization strategies. Solutions include overlay and CD metrology based on angle resolved scatterometry, scanner actuator control to enable high order overlay corrections and computational lithography optimization to minimize imaging induced pattern placement errors of devices and metrology targets. We use 10-nm node experimental data and extrapolate the error budgets towards the 7-nm technology node. The experimental data will be based on NXE:3300B and NXT:1960Bi/NXT:1970Ci exposure systems. The results are compared to the more straightforward alternative of using single expose patterning with EUV for all critical layers.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) stands as the most promising solution for the fabrication of future technology nodes in the semiconductor industry. Nonetheless, the successful introduction of EUVL into the extremely competitive and stringent high-volume manufacturing (HVM) phase remains uncertain partly because of the still limiting performance of EUV resists below 16 nm half-pitch (HP) resolution. Particularly, there exists a trade-off relationship between resolution (half-pitch), sensitivity (dose) and line-edge roughness (LER) that can be achieved with existing materials. This trade-off ultimately hampers their performance and extendibility towards future technology nodes. Here we present a comparative study of highly promising chemically amplified resists (CARs) that have been evaluated using the EUV interference lithography (EUV-IL) tool at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) synchrotron facility in the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). In this study we have focused on the performance qualification of different resists mainly for 18 nm and 16 nm half-pitch line/space resolution (L/S = 1:1). Among the most promising candidates tested, there are a few choices that allow for 16 nm HP resolution to be achieved with high exposure latitude (up to ~ 33%), low LER (down to 3.3 nm or ~ 20% of critical dimension CD) and low dose-to-size (or best-energy, BE) < 41 mJ/cm2 values. Patterning was even demonstrated down to 12 nm HP with one of CARs (R1UL1) evaluated for their extendibility beyond the 16 nm HP resolution. 11 nm HP patterning with some pattern collapse and well resolved patterns down 12 nm were also demonstrated with another CAR (R15UL1) formulated for 16 nm HP resolution and below. With such resist it was possible even to obtain a small process window for 14 nm HP processing with an EL ~ 8% (BE ~ 37 mJ/cm2, LER ~ 4.5 nm). Though encouraging, fulfilling all of the requirements necessary for high volume production, such as high resolution, low LER, high photon sensitivity (dose), and high exposure latitude (EL) simultaneously still remains challenging below 16 nm HP.", "In this paper, we proposed a new design of the test mask to measure the amount of the out-of-band (OOB) light from an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) light source by detuning the period of the multilayer (ML), rather than changing the material of the absorber, to suppress reflection of EUV light. The new OOB test mask also reflects essentially the same OOB light as that of the production mask at each wavelength in the whole OOB spectral range. With the help of the new OOB test mask, the contributions to the background intensity from in-band flare and OOB light can be correctly separated and an accurate optical-proximity-correction (OPC) model can be established.", "As EUV reaches high volume manufacturing, scanner source power and reticle defectivity attract a lot of attention. Keeping a EUV mask clean after mask production is as essential as producing a clean EUV mask. Even though EUV pellicle is actively investigated, we might expose EUV masks without EUV pellicle for some time. To keep clean EUV mask under pellicle-less lithography, EUV scanner cleanliness needs to meet the requirement of high volume manufacturing. In this paper, we will show the cleanliness of EUV scanners in view of mask particle adders during scanner exposure. From this we will find several tendencies of mask particle adders depending on mask environment in scanner. Further we can categorize mask particle adders, which could show the possible causes of particle adders during exposure in scanners.", "In NXE laser-produced-plasma (LPP) light sources, extreme-ultra-violet (EUV) light is created by exciting small droplets of Sn with a pre-pulse and main pulse laser. The Sn droplet is converted into plasma, which emits the desired light wavelength. Under non-optimal conditions, tin debris fragments can be created that can contaminate the light source optics. The current presentation describes experiments with a novel metrology technique that can detect and quantify debris in the source. The results can be used to optimize source settings to significantly reduce contamination and increase lifetime and availability.\nA novel optical technique uses a pulsed double cavity laser at 532 nm with beam-shaping optics that is fired at a synchronized time delay after the EUV burst. The light is converted to a thin light sheet that illuminates possible debris fragments in the direct region around the plasma.\nMie scattering theory is applied to convert the intensity of the incoming individual particles to an estimated diameter estimation and the two frames are correlated with advanced particle tracking algorithms to capture the velocity and direction of each individual particle. Because light intensity is used for particle sizing, small individual particles can be detected. The technique provides particle count, diameter, direction and velocity information.\nThis technique has successfully been applied on operating NXE test sources. It has proven to directly identify plasma conditions with significant debris reduction. Furthermore, it has potential to correlate the plasma settings to lifetime estimations and thus can be used for both source optimization and design.", "EIDEC has built a high-power EUV irradiation tool equipped with a laser-produced plasma source to investigate the effect of EUV power and pulsed irradiation on the resist outgassing and durability of the mask and pellicle elements. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility study on the impact of high-power EUV irradiation on key elements through the application of a high-power EUV irradiation tool. The equipment comprises a laser-produced plasma source similar to those used in presently available EUV scanners and relay mirrors which facilitates the EUV irradiation on the sample plane. The equipped laser-produced plasma source has lower power at the intermediate focus than those expected in future high-volume manufacturing EUV scanners. However, with fewer relay mirrors compared to these EUV scanners, sufficient EUV power density is emulated on the sample plane i.e. EUV power equivalent to what is expected in future high volume manufacturing EUV scanners can be obtained. The basic design configuration and performance of the laser-produced plasma source and the entire system are discussed. Tests for investigating the effect of EUV power density on the outgassing and durability of mask blanks have commenced, and the preliminary results are presented in this paper.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology is a promising candidate for a semiconductor process for 18nm half pitch and beyond. So far, the studies of EUV for manufacturability have been focused on particular aspects. It still requires fine resolution, uniform and smooth patterns, and low defectivity, not only after lithography but also after the etch process. Tokyo Electron Limited and imec are continuously collaborating to improve manufacturing quality of the process of record (POR) on a CLEAN TRACKTM LITHIUS ProTMZ-EUV. This next generation coating/developing system has been upgraded with defectivity reduction enhancements which are applied along with TELTM best known methods. We have evaluated process defectivity post lithography and post etch. Apart from defectivity, FIRMTM rinse material and application compatibility with sub 18nm patterning is improved to prevent line pattern collapse and increase process window on next generation resist materials. This paper reports on the progress of defectivity and patterning performance optimization towards the NXE:3300 POR.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is the most promising option for future manufacturing of IC devices at sub-10nm node. However, resist pattern collapse is one concern for high volume manufacturing. To mitigate resist pattern collapse, rinse material is applied for EUVL. However at narrow pitches, it was found that some rinse materials caused pattern bridging and critical dimension (CD) shift. In this study, we suggest a model of resist deformation by surfactant penetration to resist pattern. Moreover, we focused on affinity between resist and surfactant which is main components in rinse material to clarify the pattern bridging and CD-shift issue by inducing surfactant penetration to resist pattern. To define the affinity between each material, Solubility Parameter (SP) value and Difference of Solubility Parameter value (DSP) of each material was calculated. The relation between surfactant penetration and DSP of each material was investigated. To clarify the relation, stress test was applied to enhance pattern deformation. As a result, it can be said that there is good correlation between surfactant penetration and SP value. Using these studies, rinse material design with low affinity surfactant for resist was able to achieve no CD-shift and less pattern bridging defect number.", "Predicting the lithographic impact of a phase defect, that is embedded in an Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) mask, on a wafer printed image is one of the most challenging tasks. In this study, to characterize the phase defects, two types of measurement tools were employed and the data thus obtained from them were then evaluated for comparisons. One measurement tool was a scanning probe microscope used for measuring the surface topography of phase defects, and the other one was an at-wavelength dark-field inspection tool capable of capturing phase defect and then calculating the defect detection signal intensity (DSI) from those images. A programmed phase defect mask with various lateral sizes and depths was prepared. The sizes and DSIs were then measured. The measured data indicated that the DSIs did not directly correlate with the phase defect volumes. The influence of the phase defects on a wafer printed images was also calculated using a lithography simulator. The calculated results indicated that the printed critical dimensions (CDs) were strongly correlated with the DSIs rather than with the phase defect volumes. As a result, the influence of the phase defect on the printed CD can be predicted from the values of the DSIs.", "Pure thin films of organotin compounds have been lithographically evaluated using extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL, 13.5 nm). Twenty-one compounds of the type R2Sn(O2CR\u2019)2 were spin-coated from solutions in toluene, exposed to EUV light, and developed in organic solvents. Exposures produced negative-tone contrast curves and dense-line patterns using interference lithography. Contrast-curve studies indicated that the Emax values were linearly related to molecular weight when plotted separately depending upon the hydrocarbon group bound directly to tin (R = butyl, phenyl and benzyl). Additionally, Emax was found to be linearly related to free radical stability of the hydrocarbon group bound directly to tin. Dense-line patterning capabilities varied, but two resists in particular show exceptionally good line edge roughness (LER). A resist composed of an amorphous film of (C6H5CH2)2Sn(O2CC(CH3)3)2 (13) achieved 1.4 nm LER at 22 nm half-pitch patterning and a resist composed of (C6H5CH2)2Sn(O2CC6H5)2 (14) achieved 1.1 nm LER at 35 nm half-pitch at high exposure doses (600 mJ/cm2). Two photoresists that use olefin-based carboxylates, (C6H5CH2)2Sn(O2CCH=CH2)2 (11) and (C6H5CH2)2Sn(O2CC(CH3)=CH2)2 (12), demonstrated much improved photospeeds (5 mJ/ cm2 and 27 mJ/cm2) but with worse LER.", "Ligand stabilized metal oxide nanoparticle resists are promising candidates for EUV lithography due to their high sensitivity for high-resolution patterning and high etching resistance. As ligand exchange is responsible for the patterning mechanism, we systematically studied the influence of ligand structures of metal oxide EUV nanoparticles on their sensitivity and dissolution behavior. ZrO2 nanoparticles were protected with various aromatic ligands with electron withdrawing and electron donating groups. These nanoparticles have lower sensitivity compared to those with aliphatic ligands suggesting the structures of these ligands is more important than their pka on resist sensitivity. The influence of ligand structure was further studied by comparing the nanoparticles\u2019 solubility for a single type ligand to mixtures of ligands. The mixture of nanoparticles showed improved pattern quality.", "Line width roughness (LWR) remains a critical issue when moving towards smaller feature sizes in EUV lithography. At the same time, negative-tone develop (NTD) resist has become a promising process to get wide process margin at narrow trenches and for block mask layers in optical lithography. Here, we present a study on printing behavior of an EUV NTD resist which was exposed at IMEC on the AMSL NXE:3100 EUV tool. In particular, we analyzed the line width roughness, which was found to be pattern dependent. We calibrated a stochastic resist model to the experimental CD and LWR data. The resulting model was used to analyze and understand the pattern dependent LWR behavior. Simulation results for different LWR process window between iso trench, dense line and iso line was verified with measurement results.", "EUVL patterned mask defect detection is one of the major issues to realize device fabrication with EUV lithography.1-6 We have already designed a novel Projection Electron Microscope (PEM) optics that has been integrated into a new inspection system named EBEYE-V30 (\u201cModel EBEYE\u201d is an EBARA\u2019s model code), and which seems to be quite promising for hp 16 nm node EUVL patterned mask inspection. The PEM system performs well for hp 16 nm EUVL patterned mask inspection. Moreover, we discuss the system extendibility to 11 nm node defect detection. High-speed image sensor, high-speed image processing circuit, and bright/stable electron source are necessary for hp 11 nm defect inspection. We describe the experimental results of the EUVL patterned mask inspection using the abovementioned system for hp 11 nm node. Programmed defects in hp 11 nm (44 nm on mask) are applied for defect detection sensitivity evaluation.", "Defect detectability using electron beam (EB) inspection for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask was investigated by comparing a projection electron microscope (PEM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) inspection system. The detectability with EB does not coincide with the printability data because the contrasts of EUV aerial image and EB image for EUV mask are reversed. The detectability for 16 nm sized defect on a half pitch 64 nm line and space pattern is acceptable under 2-nm-line edge roughness (LER) (3 sigma) in both PEM and SEM inspections by applying a special algorithm for image processing. The required and robust inspection conditions such as the number of electrons per pixel and pixel size (resolution) are examined for SEM inspection system. Throughput of a PEM inspection system corresponds to that of a multi-beam SEM one with 250 \u2013 1000 beams.", "The EUV photoreactivity of platinum and palladium mononuclear complexes has been investigated. Many platinum and palladium complexes show little or no EUV sensitivity, however, we have found that metal carbonates and metal oxalates (L2M(CO3) and L2M(C2O4); M = Pt or Pd) are sensitive to EUV. The metal-carbonates give negative tone behavior. The most interesting result is that the metal oxalates give first positive-tone EUV resists based on mono-nuclear organometallic compounds. In particular, (dppm)Pd(C2O4) (dppm = 1,1-Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) (25) prints 30-nm dense lines with Esize of 50 mJ/cm2. To improve the lithographic performance of (25), the processing conditions were studied. A bake study showed that bake affected sensitivity and dark loss very little, while dark loss worsened with development time. Derivatives of (25) were synthesized to explore the effect of molecular weight on resist sensitivity, but the study showed no correlation between molecular weight and sensitivity.", "Scaling the power of the tin droplet laser-produced-plasma (LPP) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source to 500W has eluded the industry after a decade of effort. In 2014 we proposed [2] a solution: placing the laser-plasma interaction region within an argon plasma in a magnetic cusp. This would serve to ionize tin atoms and guide them to a large area annular beam dump. We have since demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. We present first results from a full-scale test plasma at power levels relevant to the generation of at least 200W, showing both that the argon cusp plasma is very stable, and that its geometrical properties are ideal for the transport of exhaust power and tin to the beam dump.", "The authors report on experimental and simulative scattering analyses of phase and amplitude defects found in extreme ultraviolet multilayer mirrors, such as mask blanks for EUV lithography. The goal of the analyses is to develop a novel mask blank inspection procedure using one single inspection tool that allows to determine whether a defect is a surface type (amplitude) defect, or a buried type (phase) defect. The experiments were carried out with an actinic dark-field reflection microscope. Programmed defects of both types were fabricated, using different nanostructuring techniques. Analytical and rigorous scattering simulations were carried out to predict and support the experimental results.", "EUV lithography (EUVL) is well known to be a strong candidate for next generation, single exposure sub-30nm half-pitch lithography.[1] Furthermore, a high-NA EUV exposure tool released two years ago gave a strong impression for finer pattern results. On one hand, it seems that the coat develop track process remains very similar and in many aspects returns to KrF or ArF dry process fundamentals, but in practice the 26-32nm pitch patterning coat-develop track process also has challenges with EUV resist. As access to EUV lithography exposures has become more readily available over the last five (5) years, several challenges and accomplishments in the track process have been reported, such as the improvement of ultra-thin film coating, CD uniformity, defectivity, line width roughness (LWR) and so on.[2-6] The coat-develop track process has evolved along with novel materials and metrology capability improvements. Line width roughness (LWR) and defect control are demonstrated utilizing the SOKUDO DUO coat-develop track system with an ASML NXE:3100 in the IMEC (Leuven, Belgium) clean room environment. Additionally, we will show the latest lithographic results obtained by novel processing approaches in an EUV coat-develop track system.", "It is challenging to implement extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for mass production because the demands for the EUV resist materials are very strict. Under such circumstances, it is important in EUV resist design to clarify the dissolution behavior of the resist film into alkaline developer. In particular, the dissolution in exposed area of resist films is one of the most critical processes. However, the details in dissolution process of EUV resist have not been investigated thus far. In this study, the dissolution of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS) polymer and PHS partially-protected with t-butoxycarbonyl group (t-BOC-PHS) with and without additives such as acid generator and amines was studied by using the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method. The dissolution behavior of thin films was investigated by varying the exposure dose and the acid generator concentration from the standpoint of a systematic understanding of the effects of each resist component on dissolution kinetics. The dissolution speed became slower with increase of TPS-tf concentration in PHS and t-BOC-PHS. It is important for the EUV resist design to take into account the concentration of undecomposed PAG.", "The resist underlayer (UL) has been shown to beneficially impact the exposure latitude in photolithography techniques. As a result, the development of the resist UL is in progress for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) as well. Since the aspect ratio of patterns increases as the feature size decreases, a high-performance EUV UL is expected to be in high demand. In this study, we evaluated the optical properties of the EUV UL by using the lithography simulation tool PROLITH X5 (KLA-Tencor). We quantified the imaging properties of a 14 nm half-pitch (HP) line and space (L/S) pattern by varying the refractive index, extinction coefficient and thickness of the UL under 0.5 numerical aperture (NA) conditions with a conventional binary intensity mask. These simulations reveal that the number of photons absorbed in the photoresist increases as the refractive index of the UL decreases; this results from the increase in reflectivity from the UL/photoresist interface. Therefore, the line critical dimension (CD) mean value decreases and stochastic imaging properties improve in the observation plane. As the refractive index of the UL is reduced, however, the light intensity in resist and the distribution of photons is distorted by the standing wave effect, resulting in roughness and non-uniformity in the pattern sidewall. Therefore, the refractive index of the UL should be similar to that of the photoresist in order to get the optimized performance.", "In this paper, we discuss a new approach to improve the resist roughness, which is applied after the lithography process. The ERC (Edge Roughness Controller) process is composed of two steps, 1) To deliver resist softening material at the resist surface 2) To give thermal flow at that region in the bake step. Several samples were prepared based on this concept and consistent improvement was observed. Finally, by optimizing ERC chemistry using HSP (Hansen Solubility Parameter), LWR improvement of 14.8% could be achieved.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography sources produce EUV photons by means of a hot, dense, highly-ionized Sn plasma. This plasma expels high-energy Sn ions and neutrals, which deposit on the collector optic used to focus the EUV light. This Sn deposition lowers the reflectivity of the collector optic, necessitating downtime for collector cleaning and replacement. A method is being developed to clean the collector with an in-situ hydrogen plasma, which provides hydrogen radicals that etch the Sn by forming gaseous SnH4. This method has the potential to significantly reduce collector-related source downtime. EUV reflectivity restoration and Sn cleaning have been demonstrated on multilayer mirror samples attached to a Sn-coated 300mm-diameter steel dummy collector driven at 300W RF power with 500sccm H2 and a pressure of 260mTorr. Use of the in-situ cleaning method is also being studied at industriallyapplicable high pressure (1.3 Torr). Plasma creation across the dummy collector surface has been demonstrated at 1.3 Torr with 1000sccm H2 flow, and etch rates have been measured. Additionally, etching has been demonstrated at higher flow rates up to 3200sccm. A catalytic probe has been used to measure radical density at various pressures and flows. The results lend further credence to the hypothesis that Sn removal is limited not by radical creation but by the removal of SnH4 from the plasma. Additionally, further progress has been made in an attempt to model the physical processes behind Sn removal.", "A stochastic resist simulator has first been calibrated to experimental results performed on a commercially available EUV resist, and subsequently has been used to study the influence of acid/base quenching rate and the polymer deprotection rate on resist LER for 22 nm half-pitch lines/spaces. Results indicate that larger quenching rates and smaller deprotection rates result in improved LER performance by causing an increase in the dose to size. With nominal quenching rate determined from literature, halving the deprotection rate relative to nominal value reduces the LER by 33%, while the dose to size increases by 2x. With nominal deprotection rate determined from literature, results indicate a low sensitivity of LER to quenching rate. Expected noise at the line edge calculated by using a shot noise model accounting for absorbed photons, acid, and base count, provides a good explanation for the LER trends calculated for several reaction rate scenarios.", "EUV sources with high brightness and stability are required for actinic photomask inspection. High availability and cleanliness after IF are additional stringent requirements. EUV lithography is only production ready, if these tools are available with HVM specifications. At the Laboratory for Energy Conversion, ETH Zurich, droplet-based EUV LPP sources have been designed, developed and tested at the system level for the last 8 years and has been commercialized by Adlyte AG. The most advanced facility, namely ALPS II, has been operated as a prototype source for hundreds of hours. In the present work, the EUV plasma is imaged with the help of a pinhole camera. The dimension of the plasma in the direction of the laser axis and the direction of the train equal 60 \u03bcm and 70 \u03bcm, respectively. The plasma is also imaged using an ICCD with an exposure time of 5 ns. The observed droplet plasma has a characteristic kidney shape. The ICCD is a valuable diagnostic as inspection tools require high pulse-to-pulse reproducibility that cannot be assessed to the full extend using a EUV pinhole camera. Various collector configurations, using either NI or GI, have been integrated into the source. The measurements of the emission characteristics at IF for a GI collector configuration reveal a Gaussian spot shape at IF and a pulse-to-pulse stability of 6.8 % (\u03c3), which matches previous stabilities at the source level. The debris mitigation system employs a three layer strategy between the plasma and IF. Introducing a high momentum flow as a first layer of debris mitigation, the load of tin spots on the collector could be reduced by a factor of 9, hence a significant increase of source life-time is obtained. A quantification by Adlyte of IF cleanliness after 24 hours source operation revealed no relevant contamination with respect to the requirements for Blank Inspection Cleanliness after IF.", "Our group previously explored methods for measuring simulation parameter for advanced chemically amplified (CA) resists, including development parameters [1]. Dill\u2019s C parameter [2-3] , acid diffusion length generated from PAG [4], and de-protection reaction parameters [5-6]. We performed simulations of EUV resists using these parameters, the results of which allowed us to examine the conditions for reducing LER and improving resolution. This paper discusses a method for measuring the Dill\u2019s B parameter, which had been difficult to measure with conventional methods. We also confirmed that enhancing the resist polymer\u2019s EUV light absorption is effective in improving the sensitivity of the CA resist.", "It is shown that the power consumption in the double-pulse bi-spectral primary source for EUV lithography can be substantially decrease by replacing pre-amplifiers in power CO2 laser with the SRS converters wavelength 1.06 \u03bcm to 10.6 \u03bcm while maintaining efficiency of EUV radiation output of illuminated plasma.", "A new systematic error calibration method in lateral shearing interferometry (LSI) is proposed for extreme ultraviolet lithography. This method is used to remove the most significant errors: geometric optical path difference (OPD) and detector tilt error. The difference fronts of 0th and \u00b11st order diffracted waves are used to reconstruct wavefront. The Zernike coefficients of the reconstructed wavefront are used to calculate the distance among different diffracted light converging points (d). The difference front of 0th and +1st order diffracted waves is mirrored and added to the difference front of 0th and \u20131st order diffracted waves. The sum is used to calculate detector tilt angle. The geometric OPD and detector-tilt induced systematic errors are removed based on the calculated d and detector tilt angle. Simulations show that the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the residual systematic error is smaller than 0.1nm. The proposed method can be used to accurately measure the aberration of EUV optics with large numerical aperture (NA 0.5) in LSI.", "This paper introduces key components technology update of 100 W HVM LPP-EUV (laser produced plasma extreme ultraviolet) source which enable sub-10 nm critical layer patterning. This light source system is composed of several key components and each has its innovating, key and original technology. They are perfectly controlled and work harmoniously to produce stable plasma and provide high power EUV light in long term to the photolithography equipment. This paper describes the latest results obtained from our proto systems and test stands which support one hundred watt HVM LPP-EUV light source. Key components performance with experimental data and measurements are reported, such as high power short pulse CO2 drive laser, unique pre-pulse laser technology, very small droplet generation, magnetic debris mitigation, laser-droplet shooting control and etc.", "A Free Electron Laser (FEL) is a highly coherent, highly collimated light source capable of creating extremely high power beams of precisely controlled wavelengths. The semiconductor industry is currently examining these as sources extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light for photolithography applications. An important factor to achieve high quality FEL emission is the careful development of the amplifying RF system as a complete integrated unit, considering each component as part of the amplification chain to maximise RF stability and FEL beam quality. In this paper we review methods to optimise RF amplifier systems without compromising on output stability, compare solid-state with tube based technologies, and discuss the state-of-the-art in RF amplifier technology, highlighting recent case studies. We conclude by examining the benefits of integrated systems and highlight the solutions offered by available technologies to a range of technological challenges, in order to design and build the best possible systems with maximum possible efficiency for the demanding requirements of the semiconductor industry.", "In recent years major advancements have been made in the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP). Insertion of DSA for IC fabrication is seriously considered for the 7nm node. At this node the DSA technology could alleviate costs for double patterning and limit the number of masks that would be required per layer. At imec multiple approaches for inserting DSA into the 7nm node are considered. One of the most straightforward approaches for implementation would be for via patterning through templated DSA (grapho-epitaxy), since hole patterns are readily accessible through templated hole patterning of cylindrical phase BCP materials. Here, the pre-pattern template is first patterned into a spin-on hardmask stack. After optimizing the surface properties of the template the desired hole patterns can be obtained by the BCP DSA process. For implementation of this approach to be implemented for 7nm node via patterning, not only the appropriate process flow needs to be available, but also appropriate metrology (including for pattern placement accuracy) and DSA-aware mask decomposition are required. In this paper the imec approach for 7nm node via patterning will be discussed.", "In this paper, we present an optimization methodology for the template designs of sub-resolution contacts using directed self-assembly (DSA) with grapho-epitaxy and immersion lithography. We demonstrate the flow using a 60nm-pitch contact design in doublet with Monte Carlo simulations for DSA. We introduce the notion of Template Error Enhancement Factor (TEEF) to gauge the sensitivity of DSA printing infidelity to template printing infidelity, and evaluate optimized template designs with TEEF metrics. Our data shows that SMO is critical to achieve sub-80nm non- L0 pitches for DSA patterns using 193i.", "Diminishing error tolerance renders the customization of patterns created through directed self-assembly (DSA) extremely challenging at tighter pitch. A self-aligned customization scheme can be achieved using a hybrid prepattern comprising both organic and inorganic regions that serves as a guiding prepattern to direct the self-assembly of the block copolymers as well as a cut mask pattern for the DSA arrays aligned to it. In this paper, chemoepitaxy-based self-aligned customization is demonstrated using two types of organic-inorganic prepatterns. CHEETAH prepattern for \u201cCHemoepitaxy Etch Trim using a self-Aligned Hardmask\u201d of preferential hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ, inorganic resist), non-preferential organic underlayer is fabricated using electron beam lithography. Customized trench or hole arrays can be achieved through co-transfer of DSA-formed arrays and CHEETAH prepattern. Herein, we also introduce a tone-reversed version called reverse-CHEETAH (or rCHEETAH) in which customized line segments can be achieved through co-transfer of DSA-formed arrays formed on a prepattern wherein the inorganic HSQ regions are nonpreferential and the organic regions are PMMA preferential. Examples of two-dimensional self-aligned customization including 25nm pitch fin structures and an 8-bar \u201cIBM\u201d illustrate the versatility of this customization scheme using rCHEETAH.", "Laser thermal annealing of PS-b-PMMA is shown to modify phase segregation within the milliseconds timeframe at temperatures from the glass transition to far above the order-disorder transition temperature. We report the kinetics of phase segregation of cylinder forming PS-b-PMMA (53.8 kg/mol, fPS = 0.7) as probed by micro-beam grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering. Structure evolution was probed as a function of peak temperature, time at temperature, and quench rate, with phase segregation readily occurring on millisecond time scales and at peak quench rates up to 107 K/s. The final film morphology is dependent on both the anneal time and the quench rate to ambient. With heating to sufficiently high temperatures, the thermal history is erased yielding a final state is purely dependent on the quench rate.", "Imprint lithography has been shown to be an effective technique for replication of nano-scale features. Jet and Flash Imprint Lithography (J-FIL) involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is cross-linked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. Criteria specific to any lithographic process for the semiconductor industry include overlay, throughput and defectivity. The purpose of this paper is to describe the technology advancements made and introduce the new imprint systems that will be applied for the fabrication of advanced devices such as NAND Flash memory and DRAM. Overlay of better than 5nm (mean + 3sigma) has been demonstrated, and throughputs of 10 wafers per imprint station are now routinely achieved. Defectivity has been reduced by more than two orders of magnitude and particle adders within the tool have come down by approximately four orders of magnitude. A pilot line tool, the FPA-1100 NZ2, was used to generate most of the results in this work and conceptual plans are in place to address the requirements necessary for high volume manufacturing with an attractive cost of ownership relative to other HVM solutions for the semiconductor industry.", "Performances of the nanoimprint lithography templates were discussed considering the readiness toward the high volume manufacturing of nanoimprint lithography application along with the requirement for the templates and its fabrication process. The current status of the three major performances of the templates was shown.", "The routine \u201con demand\u201d fabrication of features smaller than 10 nm opens up new possibilities for the realization of many novel nanoelectronic, NEMS, optical and bio-nanotechnology-based devices. Based on the thermally actuated, piezoresistive cantilever technology we have developed a first prototype of a scanning probe lithography (SPL) platform able to image, inspect, align and pattern features down to single digit nano regime. The direct, mask-less patterning of molecular resists using active scanning probes represents a promising path circumventing the problems in today\u2019s radiation-based lithography. Here, we present examples of practical applications of the previously published electric field based, current-controlled scanning probe lithography on molecular glass resist calixarene by using the developed tabletop SPL system. We demonstrate the application of a step-and-repeat scanning probe lithography scheme including optical as well as AFM based alignment and navigation. In addition, sequential read-write cycle patterning combining positive and negative tone lithography is shown. We are presenting patterning over larger areas (80 x 80 \u03bcm) and feature the practical applicability of the lithographic processes.", "This article describes two- and three-dimensional optical simulations for determining optimal conditions for near-field scanning optical lithography. It was found that a combination of 30-nm thick photoresist and 50-nm thick anti-reflective coating will yield optimal results with 405 nm incident light and a hollow-cantilever probe with 100-nm aperture width. In addition to identifying the optimal conditions, the sensitivity of the resolution with respect to each parameter is explored and plotted. The mechanisms behind each trend are described with supporting simulation data.", "To demonstrate the possibility of using EBID masks for sub-10 nm pattern transfer into silicon, first experiments were carried out by using 20-40 nm EBID masks, that were etched by different chemistries. It is experimentally verified that recipes based on hydrogen bromide, chlorine and boron trichloride can selectively etch silicon when using 20-40 nm masks made by EBID. We observed an enhancement of the height ratio, i.e. the ratio of the height of structures before and after etching, up to a factor of 3.5 when using the chlorine chemistry. To demonstrate the pattern transfer of sub-10 nm structures, further experiments were carried out using 8-20 nm EBID masks in combination with hydrogen bromide, chlorine and fluorine chemistries. Fluorine chemistry provided the best results in terms of surface smoothness and height ratio. In this case, 7.4 nm lines were successfully transferred into silicon, resulting in 14.3 nm wide lines with a height ratio of approximately 5.", "By the combination of focused ion beam (FIB) local gallium implantation and selective silicon etching and diffusive boron doping it is presented a fast and flexible fabrication method that allows the creation of silicon structures of various geometries. The structures obtained by this resistless approach are electrically conductive. Free suspended mechanical resonators of different dimensions and geometries had been fabricated and measured. The resulting devices present a good electrical conductivity which is employed to characterize their high frequency mechanical response by electrical methods. Combining this method with other fabrication approaches it is feasible to fabricate singular devices adapted to specific applications.", "High defect density in thermodynamics driven DSA flows has been a major cause of concern for a while and several questions have been raised about the relevance of DSA in high volume manufacturing. The major questions raised in this regard are: 1. What is the intrinsic level of DSA-induced defects, 2. Can we isolate the DSA-induced defects from the other processes-induced defects, 3. How much do the DSA materials contribute to the final defectivity and can this be controlled, 4. How can we understand the root causes of the DSA-induced defects, their kinetics of annihilation and finally, 5. Can we have block co-polymer anneal durations that are compatible with standard CMOS fabrication techniques (in the range of minutes) with low defect levels. This manuscript addresses these important questions and identifies the issues and the level of control needed to achieve a stable DSA defect performance.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a promising technology for advanced patterning at future technology nodes, but significant hurdles remain for commercial implementation. While chemoepitaxy processes employing poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate) (PS-PMMA) are most widely studied for DSA line/space patterning, graphoepitaxy processes using more strongly segregated \u201chigh-X;\u201d block copolymers have recently shown a lot of promise, with lower defectivity and line-width roughness (LWR) than comparative chemoepitaxy processes. This paper reports on some of the design considerations for optimizing line/space patterning with these materials. We have found that brush and block copolymer selection are critical to achieve high quality DSA. For example, brush thickness must be optimized to achieve matching space critical dimensions, and brush surface energy impacts kinetics of assembly. The X parameter of the block copolymer should be optimized to balance LWR, kinetics of assembly, and process window. Glass transition temperature (Tg) of the blocks showed little impact on performance. Overall, parameters of both BCP and brush must be simultaneously optimized to achieve high quality DSA.", "A new imprint directed self-assembly (DSA) route is developed for creating high resolution line patterns consisting of in-plane polystyrene-block-polydimethylsiloxane (PS-b- PDMS) cylinders. Resist line prepatterns are prepared by nanoimprint and trimmed by oxygen plasma to proper feature geometry and dimension. Registered block copolymer line patterns with exceptional long-range order are generated after DSA then, with the smallest half-pitch of 6 nm or so. Excellent stretching capability of PS-b-PDMS polymer chains indicates a broad process window for DSA. Initial pattern transfer results at 16.5 nm pitch imply the potential of this approach for future nanodevice fabrication at ultra-high pattern resolution.", "Significant progresses on 300 mm wafer level DSA (Directed Self-Assembly) performance stability and pattern quality were demonstrated in recent years. DSA technology is now widely regarded as a leading complementary patterning technique for future node integrated circuit (IC) device manufacturing. We first published SMARTTM DSA flow in 2012. In 2013, we demonstrated that SMARTTM DSA pattern quality is comparable to that generated using traditional multiple patterning technique for pattern uniformity on a 300 mm wafer. In addition, we also demonstrated that less than 1.5 nm/3\u03c3 LER (line edge roughness) for 16 nm half pitch DSA line/space pattern is achievable through SMARTTM DSA process. In this publication, we will report impacts on SMARTTM DSA performances of key pre-pattern features and processing conditions. 300mm wafer performance process window, CD uniformity and pattern LER/LWR after etching transfer into carbon-hard mask will be discussed as well.", "A 27nm-pitch Graphoepitaxy directed self-assembly (DSA) process targeting fin formation for FinFET device fabrication is studied in a 300mm pilot line environment. The re-designed guiding pattern of graphoepitaxy DSA process determines not only the fine DSA structures but also the fin customization in parallel direction. Consequently, the critical issue of placement error is now resolved with the potential of reduction in lithography steps. However, challenges in subsequent pattern transfer are observed due to insufficient etch budget. The cause of the issues and process optimization are illustrated. Finally, silicon fins with 100nm depth in substrate with pre-determined customization is demonstrated.", "In this paper, we present a route for making smart functionalized plastic parts by injection molding with sub-micrometer surface structures. The method is based on combining planar processes well known and established within silicon micro and sub-micro fabrication with proven high resolution and high fidelity with truly freeform injection molding inserts. The link between the planar processes and the freeform shaped injection molding inserts is enabled by the use of nanoimprint with flexible molds for the pattern definition combined with unidirectional sputter etching for transferring the pattern. With this approach, we demonstrate the transfer of down to 140 nm wide holes on large areas with good structure fidelity on an injection molding steel insert. The durability of the sub-micrometer structures on the inserts have been investigated by running two production series of 102,000 and 73,000 injection molded parts, respectively, on two different inserts and inspecting the inserts before and after the production series and the molded parts during the production series.", "Due to its high resolution and applicability for large area patterning, Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) is a promising technology for photovoltaic (PV) applications. However, a successful industrial application of NIL processes is only possible if large-area processing on thin, brittle and potentially rough substrates can be achieved in a high-throughput process. In this work, the development of NIL processes using the novel SmartNILTM technology from EV Group with a focus on PV applications is described. We applied this tooling to realize a honeycomb texture (8 \u03bcm period) on the front side of multicrystalline silicon solar cells leading to an improvement in optical efficiency of 7% relative and a total efficiency gain of 0.5% absolute compared to the industrial standard texture (isotexture). On the rear side of monocrystalline silicon solar cells, we realized diffraction gratings to make use of light trapping effects. An absorption enhancement of up to 35% absolute at a wavelength of 1100 nm is demonstrated. Furthermore, we combined photolithography and NIL processes to introduce features for metal contacts into honeycomb master structures, which initially were realized using interference lithography. As final application, we investigated the realization of very fine contact fingers with prismatic shape in order to minimize reflection losses.", "Nanosculpting, the fabrication of two- and three-dimensional shapes at the nanoscale, enables applications in photonics, metamaterials, multi-bit magnetic memory, and bio-nanoparticles. A promising high resolution and high throughput method for nanosculpting is nanoimprint lithography (NIL). A key requirement to achieving manufacturing viability of nanosculptures in NIL is maintaining image fidelity through each step of the imprinting process. In particular, polymer densification during UV curing can distort the imprinted image. Here we study the shape changes introduced by polymer densification and develop a forward method for predicting changes in nanoscale geometries from UV curing. We show that shape changes by polymer densification are governed by the Poisson\u2019s ratio, the shrinkage coefficient of the polymer resist, and the geometric aspect ratios of the nanosculpted shape. We also show that the size of the residual layer does not impact the final profile of the imprinted shape.", "The incident surface power density in Massive Electron-beam Direct Write (MEBDW) during exposure is ~105 W/cm2, much higher than ~8 W/cm2 ArF scanners and 2.4 W/cm2 EUV. In addition, the wafer\u2019s exposure in vacuum environment makes energy dissipation even harder. This thermal effect can cause mechanical distortion of the wafer during exposure and have has a direct influence on pattern placement error and image blur. In this paper, the thermo mechanical distortions caused by wafer heating for MEB system of different electron acceleration voltages have been simulated with finite element method (FEM). The global thermal effect affected by the friction force between the wafer and the wafer chuck as well as different thermal conductivities of the chuck material are simulated. Furthermore, the thermal effects of different lithography systems such as EUV scanners and conventional optical scanners are compared. The thermal effects of MEBDW systems are shown to be acceptable.", "E-beam Direct Write (EBDW) process window simulations were performed on critical layers in Altera designs of the 20 nm node (minimum metal half-pitch 32 nm). For selected layout clips, a direct comparison is made with 193i simulation results. Local Interconnect and Via0 (single patterning) and Metal1 (Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch (LELE) double patterning) layers are considered. The EBDW dose latitude was found to exceed that of the 193i process by a factor 4. As the electron beam total spot size is of the order of the Critical Dimension (CD) for the considered node, interplay between neighboring features is low. This results in straightforward data preparation with typically 2 kernels and \u2018clean\u2019 process windows. The latter are mainly limited by Edge Placement Errors of Line Ends. The curves for the various simulation sites roughly overlap, as opposed to the 193i case in which they differ significantly. In EBDW the performance of square vias equals that of rectangular vias, enabling a denser via packing.", "In this study a novel stitching method other than Soft Edge (SE) and Smart Boundary (SB) is introduced and benchmarked against SE. The method is based on locally enhanced Exposure Latitude without cost of throughput, making use of the fact that the two beams that pass through the stitching region can deposit up to 2x the nominal dose. The method requires a complex Proximity Effect Correction that takes a preset stitching dose profile into account. On a Metal clip at minimum half-pitch of 32 nm for MAPPER FLX 1200 tool specifications, the novel stitching method effectively mitigates Beam to Beam (B2B) position errors such that they do not induce increase in CD Uniformity (CDU). In other words, the same CDU can be realized inside the stitching region as outside the stitching region. For the SE method, the CDU inside is 0.3 nm higher than outside the stitching region. 5 nm direct overlay impact from B2B position errors cannot be reduced by a stitching strategy.", "Making the best use of the characteristic features in nanocrystalline Si (nc-Si) ballistic hot electron source, the alternative lithographic technology is presented based on the two approaches: physical excitation in vacuum and chemical reduction in solutions. The nc-Si cold cathode is a kind of metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) diode, composed of a thin metal film, an nc-Si layer, an n+-Si substrate, and an ohmic back contact. Under a biased condition, energetic electrons are uniformly and directionally emitted through the thin surface electrodes. In vacuum, this emitter is available for active-matrix drive massive parallel lithography. Arrayed 100\u00d7100 emitters (each size: 10\u00d710 \u03bcm2, pitch: 100 \u03bcm) are fabricated on silicon substrate by conventional planar process, and then every emitter is bonded with integrated complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) driver using through-silicon-via (TSV) interconnect technology. Electron multi-beams emitted from selected devices are focused by a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) condenser lens array and introduced into an accelerating system with a demagnification factor of 100. The electron accelerating voltage is 5 kV. The designed size of each beam landing on the target is 10\u00d710 nm2 in square. Here we discuss the fabrication process of the emitter array with TSV holes, implementation of integrated ctive-matrix driver circuit, the bonding of these components, the construction of electron optics, and the overall operation in the exposure system including the correction of possible aberrations. The experimental results of this mask-less parallel pattern transfer are shown in terms of simple 1:1 projection and parallel lithography under an active-matrix drive scheme.\nAnother application is the use of this emitter as an active electrode supplying highly reducing electrons into solutions. A very small amount of metal-salt solutions is dripped onto the nc-Si emitter surface, and the emitter is driven without using any counter electrodes. After the emitter operation, thin metal (Cu, Ni, Co, and so on) and elemental semiconductors (Si and Ge) films are uniformly deposited on the emitting surface. Spectroscopic surface and compositional analyses indicate that there are no significant contaminations in deposited thin films. The implication is that ballistic hot electrons injected into solutions with appropriate kinetic energies induce preferential reduction of positive ions in solutions with no by-products followed by atom migration, nuclei formation, and the subsequent thin film growth. The availability of this technique for depositing thin SiGe films is also demonstrated by using a mixture solution. When patterned fine emission windows are formed on the emitter surface, metal and semiconductor wires array are directly deposited in parallel.", "A viable pattern customization strategy is a critical to continue fin pitch scaling. Analysis shows that a self-aligned customization scheme will be required for fin pitch scaling beyond 20nm. In this paper, we explore scaling of the Tone-Inverted Grapho-Epitaxy technique with 24nm pitch PS-b-PMMA polymer to create groups of fins with self-aligned spaces in between. We discuss material selection, self-aligned customization, and etch processes to form 24-nm-pitch fins on silicon on insulator substrates. We demonstrate two-dimensional pattern customization at 24nm pitch, confirming scalability of this approach. FinFET device integration results at both 28 and 24 nm pitches shows a promising path for continued fin pitch scaling.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of lamellae-forming block copolymers (BCP) via chemo-epitaxy is a potential lithographic solution to achieve patterns of dense features. Progress to date demonstrates encouraging results, but in order to better understand the role of all parameters, systematic analysis of each factor needs to be assessed. Small changes in the volume fraction of a lamellae-forming BCP have been shown to change the connectivity of unguided domains. When an asymmetric lamellae-forming BCP is assembled on chemical patterns generated with the LiNe flow, the patterning performance and defect modes change depending on whether the majority or minority volume fraction phase is guided by the chemical pattern. Asymmetric BCP formulations were generated by blending homopolymer with a symmetric BCP. The patterning performance of the BCP formulations was assessed for different pattern pitches, guide stripe widths, backfill materials and annealing times. Optical defect inspection and SEM review are used to track the majority defect mode for each formulation. Formulation-dependent trends in defect modes show the importance of optimizing the BCP formulation in order to minimize the defectivity.", "In this study, half-pitch (HP) 15 nm line-and-space (L/S) metal wires were successfully fabricated and fully integrated on a 300 mm wafer by applying directed self-assembly (DSA) lithography and pattern transfer for semiconductor device manufacturing. In order to evaluate process performances of DSA, we developed a simple sub-15 nm L/S patterning process using polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) lamellar block copolymer (BCP), which utilizes trimming resist and shallow etching spin-on-glass (SOG) as pinning guide[1]-[4]. From the results of defect inspection after SOG etch using Electron Beam (EB) inspection system, defects were classified as typical DSA defects or defects relating to DSA pattern transfer. From the evaluation of DSA L/S pattern Critical Dimension (CD), roughness and local placement error using CD-SEM, it is considered that isolated PS lines are placed at the centerline between guides and that placement of paired PS lines depends on the guide width. The control of the guide resist CD is the key to local placement error and the paired lines adjacent to the guide shifted toward the outside (0.5 nm) along the centerline of the isolated line after SOG etch. We demonstrated fabrication of HP 15 nm metal wires in trenches formed by the DSA process with reactive ion etching (RIE), followed by metal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). By SEM observation of alignment errors between the trenches and connect spaces, overlay shift patterns (-4 nm) in guide lithography mask were fabricated without intra-wafer alignment errors.", "Density multiplication and contact shrinkage of patterned templates by directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) stands out as a promising alternative to overcome the limitations of conventional lithography. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the potential of DSA to address contact and via levels patterning with high resolution by performing either CD shrink or contact multiplication. Different DSA processes are benchmarked based on several success criteria such as: CD control, defectivity (missing holes) as well as placement control. More specifically, the methodology employed to measure DSA contact overlay and the impact of process parameters on placement error control is detailed. Using the 300mm pilot line available in LETI and Arkema\u2019s materials, our approach is based on the graphoepitaxy of PS-b-PMMA block copolymers. Our integration scheme, depicted in figure 1, is based on BCP self-assembly inside organic hard mask guiding patterns obtained using 193i nm lithography. The process is monitored at different steps: the generation of guiding patterns, the directed self-assembly of block copolymers and PMMA removal, and finally the transfer of PS patterns into the metallic under layer by plasma etching. Furthermore, several process flows are investigated, either by tuning different material related parameters such as the block copolymer intrinsic period or the interaction with the guiding pattern surface (sidewall and bottom-side affinity). The final lithographic performances are finely optimized as a function of the self-assembly process parameters such as the film thickness and bake (temperature and time). Finally, DSA performances as a function of guiding patterns density are investigated. Thus, for the best integration approach, defect-free isolated and dense patterns for both contact shrink and multiplication (doubling and more) have been achieved on the same processed wafer. These results show that contact hole shrink and multiplication approach using DSA is well compatible with the conventional integration used for CMOS technology.", "In this paper we address an important topic for the development of block copolymer directed self assembly, which is the lack of the third dimensional information. The three-dimensional shape of the DSA feature directly impacts the ability to transfer the DSA pattern into etched patterns. Through TEM sample preparation by in-situ focused ion beam (FIB) Pt deposition and milling, we show cross-sectional images for the two most elemental building blocks of directed self assembled block copolymers, namely, the single and double-hole (peanut shape) etched in Si structures with great contrast at the interface formed by PS and PMMA. Additionally, a hard-mask single hole structure processed with a different template material is shown as well. Elemental mapping with energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) was shown to assist interpretation of images. 3D reconstruction of the holes formed in the hard-mask sample was performed using dark field (DF) STEM. A reduction in the SOC and SOG thickness was observed post in-situ Pt deposition for the hard mask structure. Further TEM sample preparation improvements will be needed to minimize the compression observed.", "SEMATECH aims to identify and enable disruptive technologies to meet the ever-increasing demands of semiconductor high volume manufacturing (HVM). As such, a program was initiated in 2012 focused on high-speed e-beam defect inspection as a complement, and eventual successor, to bright field optical patterned defect inspection [1]. The primary goal is to enable a new technology to overcome the key gaps that are limiting modern day inspection in the fab; primarily, throughput and sensitivity to detect ultra-small critical defects. The program specifically targets revolutionary solutions based on massively parallel e-beam technologies, as opposed to incremental improvements to existing e-beam and optical inspection platforms. Wafer inspection is the primary target, but attention is also being paid to next generation mask inspection. During the first phase of the multi-year program multiple technologies were reviewed, a down-selection was made to the top candidates, and evaluations began on proof of concept systems. A champion technology has been selected and as of late 2014 the program has begun to move into the core technology maturation phase in order to enable eventual commercialization of an HVM system. Performance data from early proof of concept systems will be shown along with roadmaps to achieving HVM performance. SEMATECH\u2019s vision for moving from early-stage development to commercialization will be shown, including plans for development with industry leading technology providers.", "Targeting mass production of nanostructures, nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is one of the most cost-effective ways to do so. One of the most critical topics is the pattern quality of the imprint master template. Therefore the new Vistec SB4050 VSB e-beam writer has been evaluated regarding its capability for state-of-the-art NIL template and DOE making. Equipped with a new air bearing stage the tool can expose a wide variety of substrates including large and heavy ones. For 9035 substrates a placement accuracy of 9nm (3sigma) as well as an overlay accuracy of 7nm (3sigma) with a mean error below 2nm has been achieved. Targeting for minimum feature size, a resolution below 30nm has been achieved for both, dense lines and holes pattern even using CAR. In addition, 3D structuring capability has been proved by applying GenISys\u2019 Layout Beamer calibrated for an appropriate negative tone resist. Further investigation has been done on shot count optimization regarding circular holes respective pillars. Using a feature size dependent segmentation, writing time reduction could be achieved keeping the original feature shape. Besides screening of typical tool parameter an application driven evaluation has been done by fabricating different type of templates based on silicon and quartz. 2D and 3D features have been realized. Furthermore holograms have been fabricated and proved for their performance by optical measurements.", "Electron beam direct write lithography (EBDW) potentially offers advantages for low-volume semiconductor manufacturing, rapid prototyping or design verification due to its high flexibility without the need of costly masks. However, the integration of this advanced patterning technology into complex CMOS manufacturing processes remains challenging. The low throughput of today\u2019s single e-Beam tools limits high volume manufacturing applications and maturity of parallel (multi) beam systems is still insufficient [1,2]. Additional concerns like transistor or material damage of underlying layers during exposure at high electron density or acceleration voltage have to be addressed for advanced technology nodes. In the past we successfully proved that potential degradation effects of high-k materials or ULK shrink can be neglected and were excluded by demonstrating integrated electrical results of 28nm node transistor and BEOL performance following 50kV electron beam dry exposure [3]. Here we will give an update on the integration of EBDW in the 300mm CMOS manufacturing processes of advanced integrated circuits at the 28nm SRAM node of GLOBALFOUNDRIES Dresden. The work is an update to what has been previously published [4]. E-beam patterning results of BEOL full chip metal and via layers with a dual damascene integration scheme using a 50kV VISTEC SB3050DW variable shaped electron beam direct writer at Fraunhofer IPMSCNT are demonstrated. For the patterning of the Metal layer a Mix & Match concept based on the sequence litho - etch -litho -etch (LELE) was developed and evaluated wherein several exposure fields were blanked out during the optical exposure. Etch results are shown and compared to the POR. Results are also shown on overlay performance and optimized e-Beam exposure time using most advanced data prep solutions and resist processes. The patterning results have been verified using fully integrated electrical measurement of metal lines and vias on wafer level. In summary we demonstrate the integration capability of EBDW into a productive CMOS process flow at the example of the 28nm SRAM technology node.", "Maskless electron beam lithography is an attractive solution to address sub-90 nm technology nodes with high throughput and manufacturing costs reduction. One of the key challenges is to meet entirely process/integration specifications in terms of resolution, resist sensitivity, roughness and etch transfer into underlayers. In this paper, we evaluate and identify the optimal stack to fit printing performance using e-beam exposures and etch transfer patterning. Besides imaging performance, other key parameters such as outgassing and charge dissipation due to high current density are also considered to fully achieve targets for the machine developed by MAPPER Lithography.", "In E-beam lithography, the double or multiple Gaussian kernels used to describe the electron scattering behavior have been discussed extensively for critical dimensions (CDs) larger than the e-beam blur size. However in e-beam direct write on wafer, CD dimensions are close to the beam blur size because of requirements in both resolution and throughput. This situation gives rise to a severe iso-dense CD bias. Hence the accuracy of the modeling kernel is required to achieve a larger common process window. In this paper we present contour-based kernel modeling and verification for e-beam lithography. The edge contours of CD-SEM images of the contact hole array pattern with duty ratio splits are used in this Gaussian kernel modeling study. A 2-step optimization sequence is proposed to improve the fitting efficiency and robustness. In the first step, roundness is the primary and the most effective index at the corner region which is sensitive to determine the beam blur size. The next step is to minimize the deviation of the through-pitch proximity effect by adjusting the ratio of the electron backscattering to the electron forward scattering. The more accurate cost index, edge placement error, is applied in the subsequent optimization step with constrained beam blur sizes extracted from the previous step. The optimum modeling kernel parameters can be obtained by the lowest cost deviation of the simulation contours and the CD-SEM extracted edge contours after optimization iterations. For early study of the proximity impact on future EBDW systems, the exposure experiment is performed on an EBM-8000 mask writer to build the modeling kernel. The prediction accuracy of the optimum modeling kernel on 60-nm features with different pattern densities is also verified experimentally to be within 1.5 nm.", "Verification of full-chip DSA guide patterns (GPs) through simulations is not practical due to long runtime. We develop a decision function (or functions), which receives n geometry parameters of a GP as inputs and predicts whether the GP faithfully produces desired contacts (good) or not (bad). We take a few sample GPs to construct the function; DSA simulations are performed for each GP to decide whether it is good or bad, and the decision is marked in n-dimensional space. The hyper-plane that separates good marks and bad marks in that space is determined through machine learning process, and corresponds to our decision function. We try a single global function that can be applied to any GP types, and a series of functions in which each function is customized for different GP type; they are then compared and assessed in 10nm technology.", "Cylindrical directed self-assembly (DSA) nanostructures is a promising candidate for patterning the contacts and vias in integrated circuits. To match the contact patterns in an IC layout, physical guiding templates have been adopted to generate aperiodic DSA patterns, and templates of different sizes could lead to various DSA patterns. It is found in the experiment that the density of guiding templates has a strong influence on the DSA patterns. At a low template density, templates tend to become overfilled and result in DSA defects. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate an effective solution to counteract the influence of template pattern density on the quality of DSA using sub-DSA-resolution Assist Features (SDRAFs). We show that SDRAFs can reduce the DSA defects significantly.", "DSA-aware optical or EUV lithography assist features (AFs) extend the capabilities of both traditional SRAFs and printable AFs (PrAFs). For instance, in a graphoepitaxy DSA process, where confinement wells are formed by DUV lithography, the process window of the DUVL process may be further improved by using PrAFs, as long as the confinement wells resulting from these PrAFs are sized and shaped so that they are \u201csealed\u201d by the etch resistant outcomes of the DSA process. A method to optimize placement of such DSA-aware PrAFs is presented, along with a method utilizing a regular array of etch resistant confinement wells with localized modifications of their size or shape to form etch transferrable features. Both methods are tested and verified in simulations of DUV lithography and DSA.", "A major challenge in the application of block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) to advanced lithography is the exploration of large design spaces, including the selection of confinement shape and size, surface chemistry to affect wetting conditions, copolymer chain length and block fraction. To sweep such large spaces, a computational model is ideally both fast and accurate. In this study, we investigate various incarnations of the density functional theory (DFT) approach and evaluate their suitability to DSA applications. We introduce a new optimization scheme to capitalize on the speed advantages of DFT, while minimizing loss of accuracy relative to the benchmark of self-consistent field theory (SCFT). Although current DFT models afford a 100-fold reduction in computational complexity over SCFT, even the best optimized models fail to match SCFT density profiles and make extremely poor predictions of commensurability windows and defect energetics. These limitations suggest that SCFT will remain the gold standard for DSA simulations in the near future.", "Chemoepitaxial guidance of block copolymer (BCP) directed self-assembly (DSA) in thin films is explored. The underlayers studied are line-space patterns composed of repeating highly preferential pinning stripes separated by larger, more neutral, background regions. Studies have shown that varying the properties of such a chemical pattern can have a large effect on processing window, but the effect of changing the chemical pattern on many properties of interest such as footing of the BCP are hard to measure experimentally. This study uses a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model to study a 2x density multiplying underlayer by varying the pinning stripe width and background region chemical interactions and analyzing the effect on self-assembled BCP lines. Decreasing pinning stripe width or making the background region more neutral is found to increase the LER of the lines. An undersized pinning stripe width with a neutral background region is found to give the straightest sidewalls for the formed lines, while a larger pinning stripe causes the pinned line to foot (expand near the substrate) and a preferential background region causes the unpinned line to undercut (contract near the substrate). A simple model was developed to predict the optimal conditions to eliminate footing. Using this model, conditions are found that decrease footing of the pinned line but these conditions increase undercutting in the unpinned line. Deformations in either the pinned or unpinned line propagate to the other line. There exists a tradeoff between LER and the footing/undercutting, that is, decreasing LER increases footing/undercutting and vice versa.", "Directed self-assembly of block copolymers over chemically patterned substrates has proven to be an effective method for sublithographic patterning. Features on these chemical patterns can be multiplied by the natural domain-spacing of the block copolymer assembled on top of the substrate through pattern interpolation. The LiuNealey (LiNe) chemoepitaxy flow for directed self-assembly allows for modification of the geometry and chemistry of the nanopatterned substrate. The critical dimensions and period along with the chemical composition of the patterned features in the LiNe flow govern the equilibrium morphology of the assembled block copolymer. We demonstrate how the construction of the chemical pattern affects the selection for desired, well-registered assembly of block copolymer melts by using a theoretically informed coarse-grained many-body model of block copolymers. The molecular simulations are used to provide an explanation for how to best design the chemical pattern in the LiNe flow for the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers to achieve desired line-andspace structures.", "Many high \u03c7 block copolymer (BCP) systems often have one block which shows a strong preference to wet the free interface at the top of the film. This property makes it difficult to form vertically aligned lamellae which are desired for many directed self-assembly (DSA) applications. To better understand this behavior, simulations of thin films of BCPs were carried out using a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) model. The property that leads one block to preferentially wet the free interface over the other is a difference in cohesive energy density (CED) between the two blocks. Our simulation allows for the systematic variation in the CED of each block to investigate how the magnitude of these differences affects self-assembly behavior. BCPs with no CED differences between the blocks show large ranges of underlayer compositions where vertical lamellae will form that are minimally affected by changing \u03c7 of the BCP. The range where vertical lamellae will form can be thought of as a process window. Increasing the CED asymmetry of the BCP (i.e. the difference in CED between blocks) causes a reduction in the process window and also causes a shift in the underlayer composition that is the center of the window. Increasing \u03c7 increases the process window for vertical lamellae in CED asymmetric systems. This behavior is determined by the trade-off in energy due to three interfacial interactions: A-B interface, film-free surface interface, and film-underlayer interface. At the limits of very high CED asymmetry and low \u03c7, there may be no underlayer compositions where vertical lamellae will form. A simplified model was also developed that can accurately predict these process windows for different CED asymmetry and \u03c7 values on the order of seconds and minutes compared to hours and days for the full simulation.", "Nano-imprinting technology, as one of the most promising fabrication technologies, has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for large-area replication up to wafer-level, with features down to nanometer scale. This study aims to develop capabilities in patterning nano structure using thermal nano-imprint lithography (NIL). 30nm Si molds are patterned by electron-beam lithography (EBL) using NEB22 A2 negative e-beam resist. The NEB22 A2 negative e-beam resist possess a variety of characteristics desirable for NIL, such as low viscosity, low bulk-volumetric shrinkage, high Young's modulus, high thermal stability, and excellent dry-etch resistance. The excellent oxygenetch resistance of the barrier material enables a final transfer pattern that is about three times higher than that of the original NIL mold. Based on these imprint on negative electron beam resist approach is used for pattern transfer into silicon substrates. The result is a high-resolution pattern with feature sizes in the range of nanometer to several microns.", "The methodology suggested in this research provides the great possibility of creating nanostructures composed of various materials, such as soft polymer, hard polymer, and metal, as well as Si. Such nanostructures are required for a vast range of optical and display devices, photonic components, physical devices, energy devices including electrodes of secondary batteries, fuel cells, solar cells, and energy harvesters, biological devices including biochips, biomimetic or biosimilar structured devices, and mechanical devices including micro- or nano-scale sensors and actuators.", "About 13-Terabyte data for Massive e-beam direct-write lithography (MEBDW) system, a potential solution for highvolume manufacturing (HVM) of 10-nm and beyond technology nodes in a 26 mm x 33 mm field of layout, is required. Therefore cost reduction on data storage and transmission through development of high compression rate of lossless data and high throughput real time decompression algorithms is necessary. In this paper, an instruction-based hybrid method (IBHM) is proposed. It is an asymmetric scheme to hybrid simple compression methods. The decompression is achieved by instruction-based decoding. The input layout image is partitioned into different fragments, compressed and encoded into instructions. On the MEBDW system side, the encoded bit-stream is decoded by the IBHM decoder. The function of this decoder is to execute only a minimal number of simple instructions, thus the decoder can be implemented with low gate-count on ASIC. Simulation results show that a single IBHM decoder is capable of providing an output data rate as high as ~50 Gbps in various masking layers.", "In addition to sub-20 nm technology nodes, multi-beam lithography at low-energy has also the capability to address mature CMOS technologies [130-45nm nodes] with high throughput and significant manufacturing costs reduction. It requires both \u201cfast\u201d resists for throughput gain and cost of ownership and \u201cthick\u201d resists matched with the current post-lithography processes such as etching and implant steps. We successfully demonstrated patterning of 45-130 nm nodes structures on different thick resists (up to 160 nm) with a 5 keV Mapper pre-alpha tool. In parallel, we developed a theoretical model to simulate 3D patterning showing good agreement with our experimental results.", "In this paper, we investigate an electric-field assisted assembly approach to create dense arrays of contact hole patterns with complex feature geometries. This hybrid strategy uses a spatially varying dielectrophoretic (DEP) force created by lithographically defined guiding features to assemble dense arrays of nanoparticles within the features, thereby replicating features within the starting pattern. For close-packed particle arrays, the half- and full-pitch of the contact hole array is defined by the starting nanoparticle core and shell diameter.", "Novel metallic light-interfering fixtures were designed and fabricated in order to achieve a laser interference pattern of constant-pitch, concentric and sinusoidal light variations. These fixtures consisted of annular rings with the inner diameter shaped conically. Azobenzene-containing solid thin-films were subsequently placed behind the fixture and circular surface-relief diffraction gratings were inscribed due to the azo molecules photochemical isomerization process. Gratings pitches were dependent on the fixture dimensions and ranged from 600 to 1400 nm with depths up to 250 nm.", "Recent work with dielectric resonant reflector underlayers has shown improvements in high aspect ratio imaging via solid immersion evanescent interference lithography in the ultra-high numerical aperture (UHNA) regime. Controlling the gap at the prism/sample interface has proven to be a problem for good reproducibility, uniformity and quality of UHNA regime, high aspect ratio, resist structures. Here we present simulated and experimental results for fine tuning of the prism/sample interface to achieve greater uniformity of high aspect ratio resist structures over large exposure fields in the evanescent regime. These results highlight our solid immersion Lloyd\u2019s mirror interference lithography (SILMIL) system\u2019s limitations in the absence and presence of an index-matching layer (IML) through the use of gap control measurements and attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) measurements with various index mismatched prism/IML pairs. Finally, we present simulated results for a system that will produce uniform, high aspect ratio resist structures over large exposure fields.", "We report computational study for directed self-assembly (DSA) on morphologies\u2019 dislocation caused by block copolymers\u2019 (BCPs\u2019) thermal fluctuation in grapho-epitaxial cylindrical guides. The dislocation factor expressed as DSA-oriented placement errors (DSA-PEs) was numerically evaluated by historical data acquisition utilizing dissipative particle dynamics simulation. Calculated DSA-PEs was compared with experimental results on two kinds of guide pattern, resist guide with no surface modifications (REF guide) and resist guide with polystyrene coated (PS-brush guide). Vertical distribution of DSA-PEs within the cylindrical guides was calculated and relatively high DSA-PEs near top region was deduced particularly in REF guide. The tendency of experimental DSA-PEs was well explained by the calculation including a fluctuation parameter on the wall particles. In PS-brush guide, calculated DSA-PEs was drastically increased with becoming the guide more fluctuating. This result indicates to fabricate hard and steady guide condition in PS-brush guide so as to achieve better placements. From the variety of guide critical dimension (CD) computation, it is suggested that smaller guide CD is better to obtain good placements. The smallest DSA-PE value in this study was observed in PS-brush guide with smaller guide CD because of the strong restriction of BCP arrangement flexibility.", "Directed self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) is a process that has received great interest in the field of nanomanufacturing in the past decade, and great strides towards forming high quality aligned patterns have been made. But state of the art methods still yield defectivities orders of magnitude higher than is necessary in semi-conductor fabrication even though free energy calculations suggest that equilibrium defectivities are much lower than is necessary for economic semi-conductor fabrication. This disparity suggests that the main problem may lie in the kinetics of defect removal. This work uses a coarse-grained model to study the rates, pathways, and dependencies of healing a common defect to give insight into the fundamental processes that control defect healing and give guidance on optimal process conditions for BCP-DSA. It is found that infinitely thick films yield an exponential drop in defect heal rate above \u03c7N ~ 30. Below \u03c7N ~ 30, the rate of transport was similar to the rate at which the transition state was reached so that the overall rate changed only slightly. The energy barrier in periodic simulations increased with 0.31 \u03c7N on average. Thin film simulations show no change in rate associated with the energy barrier below \u03c7N ~ 50, and then show an increase in energy barrier scaling with 0.16\u03c7N. Thin film simulations always begin to heal at either the free interface or the BCP-underlayer interface where the increased A-B contact area associated with the transition state will be minimized, while the infinitely thick films must start healing in the bulk where the A-B contact area is increased. It is also found that cooperative chain movement is required for the defect to start healing.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers has attracted attention for its use as a simple, cost- effective patterning tool for creating vertical interconnect access (VIA) channels in nanoelectronic devices.1, 2 This technique supplements existing lithographic technologies to allow for the creation of high-resolution cylindrical holes whose diameter and placement can be precisely controlled. In this study, we use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulations to investigate the equilibrium configurations of under-filled DSA systems with air-polymer interactions. We report on a series of SCFT simulations of our three species (PMMA-b-PS diblock and air) model in cylindrical confinement to explore the role of template diameter, under-fill fraction (i.e. volume fraction of air), air-polymer surface interaction and polymer-side wall/substrate interactions on equilibrium morphologies in an under-filled template with a free top surface. We identify parameters and system configurations where a meniscus appears and explore cases with PMMA-attractive, PS-attractive, and all-neutral walls to understand the effects of wall properties on meniscus geometry and DSA morphology. An important outcome is an understanding of the parameters that control the contact angle of the meniscus with the wall, as it is one of the simplest quantitative measures of the meniscus shape. Ultimately, we seek to identify DSA formulations, templates, and surface treatments with predictable central cylinder diameter and a shallow contact angle, as these factors would facilitate broad process windows and ease of manufacturing.", "Thin films of lamellar poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-PMMA) block copolymers were prepared on brushed silicon substrates with a range of thicknesses. The brushes are expected to eliminate preferential interactions at the substrate, thereby enabling perpendicular domain orientations relative to the interfaces. Using a combination of surface microscopy and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering, we demonstrate that i) the brushed substrates are weakly preferential to PMMA; and ii) the average lamellar domain orientation is perpendicular to the substrate, but some domains are mis-oriented by up to 40\u00ba. We propose that PMMA domains deform to increase their contact area at the slightly preferential substrate, and this behavior drives the formation of out-of-plane defects such as bent or tilted domains. These outcomes suggest that depth-resolved measurements are needed to fully optimize materials and processes for block copolymer lithography.", "Bottom-up alternative lithographic masks from directed self-assembly systems have been extending the limits of critical dimensions in a cost-effective manner although great challenges in controlling defectivity remain open. Particularly, defectivity and dimensional metrology are two main challenges in lithography due to the increasing miniaturisation of circuits. To gain insights about the percentage of alignment, defectivity and order quantification, directed self-assembly block copolymer fingerprints were investigated via an image analysis methodology. Here we present the analysis of hexagonal phase of polystyrene-b-polydimethylsiloxane (PS-b-PDMS) forming linear patterns in topological substrates. From our methodology, we have performed dimensional metrology estimating pitch size and error, and the linewidth of the lines was estimated. In parallel, the methodology allowed us identification and quantification of typical defects observable in self-assembly, such as turning points, disclination or branching points, break or lone points and end points. The methodology presented here yields high volume statistical data useful for advancing dimensional metrology and defect analysis of self- and directed assembly systems.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) is a promising candidate for alternative micro lithography due to its cost effectiveness, its ability to reduce critical dimension and to increase pattern density. For contact layer patterning, grapho-epitaxy combined with cylindrical BCP is a good candidate. While contact shrink has already been a well-controlled process, contact multiplication is still undergoing further studies. In this paper we propose to study the impact of 193i scanner variations on BCP overlay for contact doubling.", "The nanomechanical properties of solvent cast polymer thin films have been investigated using PeakForceTM quantitative nanomechanical mapping. The samples consisted in films of polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) obtained after dewetting of toluene solution on a polymeric brush layer. As a second step, we have probed the mechanical properties of Poly(styrenen- methilmethacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) block co-polymers (BCP) thin films randomly oriented. The measured films has a critical thickness below 50 nm and present features to be resolved of less than 42 nm. Measured surface elastic modulus obtained present a good agreement with previous literature and show how PeakForce technique could be crucial to BCP investigation predicting the mechanical stability of the different phases.", "We present a novel approach for the creation of guiding patterns to direct the self-assembly of block copolymers. A neutral layer of a brush polymer is directly exposed by electrons, causing the cross-linking of the brush molecules, and thus changing its local affinity. The advantage relies on the achievable resolution and the reduction of the process steps in comparison with deep UV and conventional electron beam lithography, since it avoids the use of a resist. We envision that this method will be highly valuable for the investigation of novel high-chi DSA materials and complex guiding pattern designs, where pattern placement and resolution is becoming critical.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) has attracted increasing attention as the potential next generation lithography technology. One of the most promising applications of DSA is the patterning of contact holes in IC circuits using physical guiding templates. In previous studies, researchers have demonstrated that DSA patterns are determined not only by the size and shape of guiding templates, but the template density as well. However, the influence of the pattern density has not been explored systematically, nor is there a fast inspection methodology to visualize and quantify the influence. In this paper, we introduce the concept of DSA Interaction Range (DSAIR). The influence of template density on the DSA patterns is examined using Gaussian convolution of x with y [say what it is a convolution of]. This approach provides us with a fast and quantitative way to model the influence of template density and predict the location of overfilled conditions.", "We investigate energy barriers and minimum energy paths (MEPs) for transitions from dislocation-pair defects to perfect lamellae in self-assembly of AB-diblock copolymer plus A- or B-homopolymer blends using self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and the numerical string method. For neutral substrates, all minimum energy paths discovered by the string method show two successive energy barriers. The two-barrier qualitative nature of the MEPs appears not to depend on the presence or absence of small amounts of homopolymer. For the first energy barrier, the barrier height shows pronounced increase with addition of A-homopolymer due to localization of A-homopolymer on the T-junction core of the dislocation. For chemo-epitaxially patterned substrates (stripes of A-attractive substrate alternating with neutral substrate), the presence of A-attractive stripes helps draw the system towards a perfect lamellar configuration, and energy barriers along the MEP are reduced, in some cases disappearing entirely. Our findings provide guidance on how the presence of homopolymer and chemo-epitaxial prepatterns affect the stability of defective morphologies.", "Overlay metrology accuracy is a major concern for our industry. Advanced logic process require more tighter overlay control for multipatterning schemes. TIS (Tool Induced Shift) and WIS (Wafer Induced Shift) are the main issues for IBO (Image Based Overlay) and DBO (Diffraction Based Overlay). Methods of compensation have been introduced, some are even very efficient to reduce these measured offsets. Another related question is about the overlay target designs. These targets are never fully representative of the design rules, strong efforts have been achieved, but the device cannot be completely duplicated. Ideally, we would like to measure in the device itself to verify the real overlay value. Top down CDSEM can measure critical dimensions of any structure, it is not dependent of specific target design. It can also measure the overlay errors but only in specific cases like LELE (Litho Etch Litho Etch) after final patterning. In this paper, we will revisit the capability of the CDSEM at final patterning by measuring overlay in dedicated targets as well as inside a logic and an SRAM design. In the dedicated overlay targets, we study the measurement differences between design rules gratings and relaxed pitch gratings. These relaxed pitch which are usually used in IBO or DBO targets. Beyond this \u201csimple\u201d LELE case, we will explore the capability of the CDSEM to measure overlay even if not at final patterning, at litho level. We will assess the hybridization of DBO and CDSEM for reference to optical tools after final patterning.\nWe will show that these reference data can be used to validate the DBO overlay results (correctables and residual fingerprints).", "Most fabrication facilities today use imaging overlay measurement methods, as it has been the industry\u2019s reliable workhorse for decades. In the last few years, third-generation Scatterometry Overlay (SCOL\u2122) or Diffraction Based Overlay (DBO-1) technology was developed, along another DBO technology (DBO-2). This development led to the question of where the DBO technology should be implemented for overlay measurements. Scatterometry has been adopted for high volume production in only few cases, always with imaging as a backup, but scatterometry overlay is considered by many as the technology of the future. In this paper we compare imaging overlay and DBO technologies by means of measurements and simulations. We outline issues and sensitivities for both technologies, providing guidelines for the best implementation of each. For several of the presented cases, data from two different DBO technologies are compared as well, the first with Pupil data access (DBO-1) and the other without pupil data access (DBO-2). Key indicators of overlay measurement quality include: layer coverage, accuracy, TMU, process robustness and robustness to process changes. Measurement data from real cases across the industry are compared and the conclusions are also backed by simulations. Accuracy is benchmarked with reference OVL, and self-consistency, showing good results for Imaging and DBO-1 technology. Process sensitivity and metrology robustness are mostly simulated with MTD (Metrology Target Designer) comparing the same process variations for both technologies. The experimental data presented in this study was done on ten advanced node layers and three production node layers, for all phases of the IC fabrication process (FEOL, MEOL and BEOL). The metrology tool used for most of the study is KLA-Tencor\u2019s Archer 500LCM system (scatterometry-based and imaging-based measurement technologies on the same tool) another type of tool is used for DBO-2 measurements.\nFinally, we conclude that both imaging overlay technology and DBO-1 technology are fully successful and have a valid roadmap for the next few design nodes, with some use cases better suited for one or the other measurement technologies. Having both imaging and DBO technology options available in parallel, allows Overlay Engineers a mix and match overlay measurement strategy, providing back up when encountering difficulties with one of the technologies and benefiting from the best of both technologies for every use case.", "Patterning process control of advanced nodes has required major changes over the last few years. Process control needs of critical patterning levels since 28nm technology node is extremely aggressive showing that metrology accuracy/sensitivity must be finely tuned.\nThe introduction of pitch splitting (Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch) at 14FDSOInm node requires the development of specific metrologies to adopt advanced process control (for CD, overlay and focus corrections). The pitch splitting process leads to final line CD uniformities that are a combination of the CD uniformities of the two exposures, while the space CD uniformities are depending on both CD and OVL variability.\nIn this paper, investigations of CD and OVL process control of 64nm minimum pitch at Metal1 level of 14FDSOI technology, within the double patterning process flow (Litho, hard mask etch, line etch) are presented.\nVarious measurements with SEMCD tools (Hitachi), and overlay tools (KT for Image Based Overlay \u2013 IBO, and ASML for Diffraction Based Overlay \u2013 DBO) are compared. Metrology targets are embedded within a block instanced several times within the field to perform intra-field process variations characterizations.\nSpecific SEMCD targets were designed for independent measurement of both line CD (A and B) and space CD (A to B and B to A) for each exposure within a single measurement during the DP flow.\nBased on those measurements correlation between overlay determined with SEMCD and with standard overlay tools can be evaluated.\nSuch correlation at different steps through the DP flow is investigated regarding the metrology type. Process correction models are evaluated with respect to the measurement type and the intra-field sampling.", "In the current paper we are addressing three questions relevant for accuracy: 1. Which target design has the best performance and depicts the behavior of the actual device? 2. Which metrology signal characteristics could help to distinguish between the target asymmetry related overlay shift and the real process related shift? 3. How does uncompensated asymmetry of the reference layer target, generated during after-litho processes, affect the propagation of overlay error through different layers? We are presenting the correlation between simulation data based on the optical properties of the measured stack and KLA-Tencor\u2019s Archer overlay measurements on a 28nm product through several critical layers for those accuracy aspects.", "Overlay in lithography becomes much more challenging due to the shrink of device node and multi-patterning approach. Consequently, the specification of overlay becomes tighter, and more complicated overlay control methods like high order or field-by-field control become mandatory. In addition, the tight overlay specification starts to raise another fundamental question: accuracy. Overlay inaccuracy is dominated by two main components: one is measurement quality and the other is representing device overlay. The latter is because overlay is being measured on overlay targets, not on the real device structures. We investigated the following for accurate overlay measurement: optimal target design by simulation; optimal recipe selection using the index of measurement quality; and, the correlation with device pattern\u2019s overlay.\nSimulation was done for an advanced memory stack for optimal overlay target design which provides robustness for the process variation and sufficient signal for the stack. Robustness factor and sufficient signal factor sometimes contradicting each other, therefore there is trade-off between these two factors. Simulation helped to find the design to meet the requirement of both factors. The investigation involves also recipe optimization which decides the measurement conditions like wavelength. KLA-Tencor also introduced a new index which help to find an accurate measurement condition. In this investigation, we used CD-SEM to measure the overlay of device pattern after etch or decap process to check the correlation between the overlay of overlay mark and the overlay of device pattern.", "Computational metrology target design requires both an accurate metrology simulation engine and an accurate geometric model. This paper deals with the later. Optical critical dimension metrology and cross-section SEM are demonstrated as two useful methods of geometric model verification with differing capabilities. Specifically, a methodology is proposed which allows the metrology engineer to quantify the level of accuracy required by the model as a function of the tolerable uncertainty in the prediction of metrology performance metrics. The methodology identifies a subset of model parameters which need to be verified enabling the metrology engineer to invest the minimum effort in stack and topography verification which will lead to performing target designs on the first design round.", "Overlay metrology tool suppliers are offering today several options to their customers: Different hardware (Image Based Overlay or Diffraction Based Overlay), different target designs (with or without segmentation) or different target sizes (from 5 um to 30 um). All these variations are proposed to resolve issues like robustness of the target towards process variations, be more representative of the design or increase the density of measurements.\nIn the frame of the development of a triple patterning BEOL scheme of 10 nm node layer, we compare IBO targets (standard AIM, AIMid and multilayer AIMid). The metrology tools used for the study are KLA-Tencor\u2019s nextgeneration Archer 500 system (scatterometry- and imaging-based measurement technologies on the same tool).\nThe overlay response and fingerprint of these targets will be compared using a very dense sampling (up to 51 pts per field). The benefit of indie measurements compared to the traditional scribes is discussed. The contribution of process effects to overlay values are compared to the contribution of the performance of the target. Different targets are combined in one measurement set to benefit from their different strengths (performance vs size).\nThe results are summarized and possible strategies for a triple patterning schemes are proposed.", "Critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) metrology has long used empirical approaches to determine edge locations. While such solutions are very flexible, physics-based models offer the potential for improved accuracy and precision for specific applications. Here, Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate theoretical linescans from single step and line/space targets in order to build a physics-based analytical model. The resulting analytical model fits the Monte Carlo simulation results for different feature heights, widths, and pitches. While more work is required to further develop this scheme, this model is a candidate for a new class of improved edge detection algorithms for CD-SEMs.", "Traditional metrology solutions are facing a range of challenges at the 1X node such as three dimensional (3D) measurement capabilities, shrinking overlay and critical dimension (CD) error budgets driven by multi-patterning and via in trench CD measurements. Hybrid metrology offers promising new capabilities to address some of these challenges but it will take some time before fully realized. This paper explores new capabilities currently offered on the in-line Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope (CD-SEM) to address these challenges and enable the CD-SEM to move beyond measuring bottom CD using top down imaging.\nDevice performance is strongly correlated with Fin geometry causing an urgent need for 3D measurements. New beam tilting capabilities enhance the ability to make 3D measurements in the front-end-of-line (FEOL) of the metal gate FinFET process in manufacturing. We explore these new capabilities for measuring Fin height and build upon the work communicated last year at SPIE1. Furthermore, we extend the application of the tilt beam to the back-end-of-line (BEOL) trench depth measurement and demonstrate its capability in production targeting replacement of the existing Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) measurements by including the height measurement in the existing CDSEM recipe to reduce fab cycle time.\nIn the BEOL, another increasingly challenging measurement for the traditional CD-SEM is the bottom CD of the self-aligned via (SAV) in a trench first via last (TFVL) process. Due to the extremely high aspect ratio of the structure secondary electron (SE) collection from the via bottom is significantly reduced requiring the use of backscatter electrons (BSE) to increase the relevant image quality. Even with this solution, the resulting images are difficult to measure with advanced technology nodes. We explore new methods to increase measurement robustness and combine this with novel segmentation-based measurement algorithm generated specifically for BSE images. The results will be contrasted with data from previously used methods to quantify the improvement. We also compare the results to electrical test data to evaluate and quantify the measurement performance improvements.\nLastly, according to International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) from 2013, the overlay 3 sigma requirement will be 3.3 nm in 2015 and 2.9 nm in 2016. Advanced lithography requires overlay measurement in die on features resembling the device geometry. However, current optical overlay measurement is performed in the scribe line on large targets due to optical diffraction limit. In some cases, this limits the usefulness of the measurement since it does not represent the true behavior of the device. We explore using high voltage imaging to help address this urgent need. Novel CD-SEM based overlay targets that optimize the restrictions of process geometry and SEM technique were designed and spread out across the die. Measurements are done on these new targets both after photolithography and etch. Correlation is drawn between the two measurements. These results will also be compared to conventional optical overlay measurement approaches and we will discuss the possibility of using this capability in high volume manufacturing.", "A novel methodology was established for determining critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) optimum measurement condition of sub-20 nm resist patterns for 0.33NA EUV lithography yielding both small shrinkage and high precision. To investigate dependency of resist shrinkage on pattern size and electron beam irradiation condition, shrinkage of 18, 32, and 45 nm EUV resist patterns was measured over a wide range of beam conditions. A shrinkage trend similar to that of ArF resist patterns was observed for 32 and 45 nm, but 18 nm pattern showed a different dependence on acceleration voltage. Conventional methodology developed for ArF resist pattern to predict shrinkage and precision using the Taguchi method was applied to EUV resist pattern to examine the extendibility of the method. Predicted shrinkage by Taguchi method for 32 and 45 nm patterns agreed with measurements. However, the prediction error increases considerably as the pattern size decreases from 32 to 18 nm because there is a significant interaction between acceleration voltage and irradiated electron dose in L18 array used in the Taguchi method. Thus, we proposed a new method that consists of separated prediction procedures of shrinkage and precision using both a shrinkage curve and the Taguchi method, respectively. The new method was applied to 18 nm EUV resist pattern, and the optimum measurement condition with shrinkage of 1.5 nm and precision of 0.12 nm was determined. Our new method is a versatile technique which is applicable not only to fine EUV resist pattern but also to ArF resist pattern.", "Simulating SEM images is important in order to optimize SEM subsystems and the setup of the SEM for specific tasks, such as new devices and fabrication methods, as well as to complete simulation flows in lithography and nanofabrication. Monte Carlo simulators have been used for these purposes, but their disadvantage is the low speed of simulation. A fast analytic simulator of SEM images, ASEM, is presented in this paper, which takes into account the most important factors in SEM: electron scattering in 3D samples composed of various materials, electrical fields, the properties and geometry of detectors, and charging. This allows for a simulation accuracy approaching that of Monte Carlo, while the simulation time is on the scale of one minute. Examples of simulations and their comparison to actual experiments are presented with various detectors, samples, electrical fields and charging, including the contrast reversal effect due to charging. Simulations of SEM images using resist profiles exported from a lithography simulator are also presented.", "SEMATECH has initiated a program to develop massively-parallel electron beam defect inspection (MPEBI). Here we use JMONSEL simulations to generate expected imaging responses of chosen test cases of patterns and defects with ability to vary parameters for beam energy, spot size, pixel size, and/or defect material and form factor. The patterns are representative of the design rules for an aggressively-scaled FinFET-type design. With these simulated images and resulting shot noise, a signal-to-noise framework is developed, which relates to defect detection probabilities. Additionally, with this infrastructure the effect of detection chain noise and frequency dependent system response can be made, allowing for targeting of best recipe parameters for MPEBI validation experiments, ultimately leading to insights into how such parameters will impact MPEBI tool design, including necessary doses for defect detection and estimations of scanning speeds for achieving high throughput for HVM.", "A Monte Carlo electron scattering simulation tool that can create SEM images of 3D features with arbitrary geometry has been developed. This is combined with both a stochastic resist model and synthetic 3D features to probe the effect of the effect of roughness on SEM measurements. Sidewall roughness makes it difficult to precisely identify the true feature width of a line because the roughness increases the SEM signal non-proportionally to the amount of material with which it is interacting. LER generally under predicts sidewall surface roughness because the SEM has an averaging effect as the electron beam interacts with a volume of material. LER becomes a better measure of surface roughness as the correlation length of the surface roughness increases. Decreasing film thickness causes a decrease in the linewidth and increase in LER measured by SEM, especially for features 35 nm thick and below. This occurs even if the true 3D feature width and roughness is approximately constant, meaning that the apparent change in linewidth and LER is a metrology effect. Threshold based estimations of line edges are difficult because the threshold choice that best matches the true feature width changes with the feature geometry. Model based library fits of linescans do not appear to provide a solution because sidewall roughness and sidewall angle have similar effects on the linescan meaning no unique linescan likely exists.", "Wafer flatness during exposure in lithography tools is critical and is becoming more important as feature sizes in devices shrink. While chucks are used to support and flatten the wafer during exposure, it is essential that wafer geometry be controlled as well. Thickness variations of the wafer and high-frequency wafer shape components can lead to poor flatness of the chucked wafer and ultimately patterning problems, such as defocus errors. The objective of this work is to understand how process-induced wafer geometry, resulting from deposited films with non-uniform stress, can lead to high-frequency wafer shape variations that prevent complete chucking in lithography scanners. In this paper, we discuss both the acceptable limits of wafer shape that permit complete chucking to be achieved, and how non-uniform residual stresses in films, either due to patterning or process non-uniformity, can induce high spatial frequency wafer shape components that prevent chucking. This paper describes mechanics models that relate non-uniform film stress to wafer shape and presents results for two example cases. The models and results can be used as a basis for establishing control strategies for managing process-induced wafer geometry in order to avoid wafer flatness-induced errors in lithography processes.", "Aggressive advancements in semiconductor technology have resulted in integrated chip (IC) manufacturing capability at sub-20nm half-pitch nodes. With this, lithography overlay error budgets are becoming increasingly stringent. The delay in EUV lithography readiness for high volume manufacturing (HVM) and the need for multiple-patterning lithography with 193i technology has further amplified the overlay issue. Thus there exists a need for technologies that can improve overlay errors in HVM. The traditional method for reducing overlay errors predominantly focused on improving lithography scanner printability performance. However, processes outside of the lithography sector known as processinduced overlay errors can contribute significantly to the total overlay at the current requirements. Monitoring and characterizing process-induced overlay has become critical for advanced node patterning. Recently a relatively new technique for overlay control that uses high-resolution wafer geometry measurements has gained significance. In this work we present the implementation of this technique in an IC fabrication environment to monitor wafer geometry changes induced across several points in the process flow, of multiple product layers with critical overlay performance requirement. Several production wafer lots were measured and analyzed on a patterned wafer geometry tool. Changes induced in wafer geometry as a result of wafer processing were related to down-stream overlay error contribution using the analytical in-plane distortion (IPD) calculation model. Through this segmentation, process steps that are major contributors to down-stream overlay were identified. Subsequent process optimization was then isolated to those process steps where maximum benefit might be realized. Root-cause for the within-wafer, wafer-to-wafer, tool-to-tool, and station-to-station variations observed were further investigated using local shape curvature changes \u2013 which is directly related to stresses induced by wafer processing. In multiple instances it was possible to adjust process parameters such as gas flow rate, machine power, etc., and reduce non-uniform stresses in the wafer. Estimates of process-induced overlay errors were also used to perform feedforward overlay corrections for 3D-NAND production wafers. Results from the studies performed in an advanced semiconductor fabrication line are reported in this paper.", "The semiconductor industry continues to push the limits of immersion lithography through multiple patterning techniques for printing features with critical dimension 20 nm and below. As a result overlay has become one of the critical lithography control parameters impacting device performance and has a stringent budget for yielding at smaller half pitch nodes. Overlay has several sources of errors related to scanner, lens, mask, and wafer. Lithographers have developed both linear and higher order field and wafer models to successfully compensate for the static fingerprints from different sources of error. After the static modeled portion of the fingerprint is removed, the remaining overlay error can be characterized as unstable modeled error or un-modeled error, commonly called uncorrectable residual error. This paper explores the fundamental relationship of overlay to wafer geometry through mechanisms of process-induced contributions to the wafer overlay, categorized as plastic and elastic wafer deformation. Correlation of overlay to local features such as slip lines is proven experimentally. The paper describes methodologies and geometry-induced overlay metrics for the application of wafer geometry to perform overlay feedback and feed forward applications. Feedback applications allow for process development and controlling semiconductor processes through in-line monitoring of wafers. Feed forward applications could include geometrybased corrections to the scanner for compensating non-static wafer geometry related overlay errors, and grouping wafers based on higher-order geometry.", "With the device dimensions moving towards the 1X node and below, the semiconductor industry is rapidly approaching the point where existing metrology, inspection and review tools face huge challenges in terms of resolution, the ability to resolve 3D and the throughput. Due to the advantages of sub-nanometer resolution and the ability of true 3D scanning, scanning probe microscope (SPM) and specifically atomic force microscope (AFM) are considered as alternative technologies for CD-metrology, defect inspection and review of 1X node and below.\nIn order to meet the increasing demand for resolution and throughput of CD-metrology, defect inspection and review, TNO has previously introduced the parallel SPM concept, consisting of parallel operation of many miniaturized SPMs on a 300 and 450 mm wafer. In this paper we will present the proof of principle of the parallelization for metrology and inspection. To give an indication of the system\u2019s specifications, the throughput of scanning is 4500 sites per hour, each within an area of 1 \u03bcm2 and 1024 \u00d71024 pixels.", "The conventional optical lever detection technique involves optical components and its precise mechanical alignment. An additional technical limit is the weight of the optical system, in case a top-scanner is used in high speed and high precision metrology. An alternative represents the application of self-actuated AFM cantilevers with integrated 2DEG piezoresistive deflection sensors. A significant improvement in performance of such cantilevers with respect to deflection sensitivity and temperature stability has been achieved by using an integrated Wheatstone bridge configuration. Due to employing effective cross-talk isolation and temperature drift compensation the performance of these cantilevers was significantly improved. In order to enhance the speed of AFM measurements we are presenting a fast cantilever-approach technology, Q-factor-control and novel adaptive scanning speed procedure. Examples of AFM measurements with high scanning speed (up to 200 lines/s) committed to advanced lithography process development are shown.", "This paper aims at unraveling the mystery of damage in high speed AFMs for 1X node and below. With the device dimensions moving towards the 1X node and below, the semiconductor industry is rapidly approaching the point where existing metrology, inspection and review tools face huge challenges in terms of resolution, the ability to resolve 3D, and throughput.\nIn this paper, we critically asses the important issue of damage in high speed AFM for metrology and inspection of semiconductor wafers. The issues of damage in four major scanning modes (contact mode, tapping mode, non-contact mode, and peak force tapping mode) are described to show which modes are suitable for which applications and which conditions are damaging. The effects of all important scanning parameters on resulting damage are taken into account for materials such as silicon, photoresists and low K materials.\nFinally, we recommend appropriate scanning parameters and conditions for several use cases (FinFET, patterned photoresist, HAR structures) that avoid exceeding a critical contact stress such that sample damage is minimized.\nIn conclusion, we show using our theoretical analysis that selecting parameters that exceed the target contact stress, indeed leads to significant damage. This method provides AFM users for metrology with a better understanding of contact stresses and enables selection of AFM cantilevers and experimental parameters that prevent sample damage.", "Modern nano-metrology instruments require calibration references with nanometer accuracy in the x, y, and z directions. A common problem is the accurate calibration in the z direction (height). For example, it is generally not difficult to obtain accurate x- and y- calibration references for a Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM). It is, however, much more difficult to obtain accurate z-axis results. It is difficult to control z-axis piezo dynamics because during scanning in the xy-plane the x-and y-axes move at a constant rate whiles the z axis does not. Furthermore due to the high cost of producing calibration standards, the microscope is often calibrated at only one height. However, if the relationship between the measured z height and the actual z height is not linear, then the height measurements will not be correct. In this paper, we will present a method for the fabrication of calibration references with: (i) sub-10 nm features and (ii) multiple step heights on one reference, allowing for better calibration of the non-linearity in the z direction.", "In this paper, we present our most recent approach on the extraction of reliable atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip dimensions from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in order to answer future requirements on ever shrinking CD AFM tips. We demonstrate the capabilities of a newly developed, fully automatic analysis software based on advanced SEM image modeling and user a-priori knowledge integration in SEM image analysis algorithm. The impact of such breakthrough technology will be shown as a function of its stability and robustness by varying tip shape, imaging settings, and SEM setup parameters. The extracted values are compared to data yielded from a commonly used SEM image analysis approach based on threshold type algorithms, and directly related to reference CD AFM measurements. We will discuss the prospective challenges accompanied with shrinking tip dimensions and the potential of a comprehensive data fusion approach, which can be used for both R&D and high volume production.", "Simulations of Mueller matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry (MMSE) based scatterometry are used to predict sensitivity to dimensional changes and defects in directed self-assembly (DSA) patterned contact hole structures fabricated with phase-separated polystyrene-b-polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) before and after etch. The optical signature of Mueller matrix (MM) elements has a complex dependence on the structure topography and orientation, depolarization, and optical properties of the materials associated with the surface and any underlying layers. Moreover, the symmetry properties associated with MM elements provide an excellent means of measuring and understanding the topography of periodic nanostructures. A forward problem approach to scatterometry or optical model based simulations is used to investigate MMSE sensitivity to various DSA based contact hole structures and its limits to characterize DSA induced defects such as hole placement inaccuracy, missing vias, profile inaccuracy of the PMMA cylinder, and process induced defects such as presence of residual PMMA after etching.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a rising technique for sub-20 nm patterning. To fully harness DSA capabilities for patterning, a detailed understanding of the three dimensional (3D) structure of BCPs is needed. By combining sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography, we have characterized the 3D structure of self-assembled and DSA BCPs films with high precision and resolution. SIS is an emerging technique for enhancing pattern transfer in BCPs through the selective growth of inorganic material in polar BCP domains. Here, Al2O3 SIS was used to enhance the imaging contrast and enable tomographic characterization of BCPs with high fidelity. Moreover, by utilizing SIS for both 3D characterization and hard mask fabrication, we were able to characterize the BCP morphology as well as the alumina nanostructures that would be used for pattern transfer.", "Advanced nodes require precise detection and control of intricate profile details \u2013 scatterometry is tool of choice for such requirements. Scatterometry is a model-based technique, and needs extensive reference metrology for qualification. Such reference measurements are costly, time-consuming and often destructive causing delays in deployment. With increasing number of scatterometry steps in flow, and the requirement to collect more reference data points to statistically qualify shrinking metrology specifications, the cost and time for reference metrology is exponentially increasing. This work is aimed to significantly reduce this need. We developed a novel methodology whereby scatterometry spectral information itself is used to predict \u201cvirtual\u201d reference data. We qualify this methodology on several key applications from 20nm and 14nm node. We find that performance of solution developed using proposed methodology is indeed similar to performance of solution obtained using real reference data, thereby significantly reducing the lead time to develop scatterometry solutions.", "Optical scatterometry is widely used in the process control of integrated circuits (IC) manufacturing due to its inherent advantages such as nondestruction, high sampling rate, large aerial coverage and low-cost. However, in the conventional inverse problem solvent of optical scatterometry, the measurement errors are usually excessively simplified as normally distributed errors, which deviate from the actual complex ones. In this work, we will demonstrate that there exist typical outlying measurement errors in the measurement signature, and these outlying measurement errors will notably affect the result of each iteration step in the conventional Gauss-Newton (GN) method. By performing a method based on the principle of least trimmed squared estimator (LTS) regression instead of each GN iteration step, the higher measurement accuracy of a nanostructure can be achieved. The remarkably improved reconstruction of a deep-etched multilayer grating has demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method.", "Methods for solving Maxwell\u2019s equations are integral part of optical metrology and computational lithography setups. Applications require accurate geometrical resolution, high numerical accuracy and/or low computation times. We present a finite-element based electromagnetic field solver relying on unstructured 3D meshes and adaptive hp-refinement. We apply the method for simulating light scattering off arrays of high aspect-ratio nano-posts and FinFETs.", "Critical dimension and overlay measurements have become a key challenge in microelectronics process control, and the weight of metrology in the success of a patterning technique is increasing. For the 14 nm node, the limit of scanner resolution can be overcome by double patterning, which requires a maximum overlay variability of 3 nm between the two reticles of the first metal level. In the double patterning case of metal layers, critical dimension of line spaces and overlay are no longer independent. In this paper, the possibility of a common measurement after the second lithography is studied. Scatterometry has been used to fit successfully the critical dimension of the two sublevels. As sensitivity to overlay is too low in device-like target, a strategy has been implemented from diffraction-based overlay measurement. So it becomes possible to provide information on the lithography step quality before the second etch process to enable rework if necessary. Finally a scatterometry target has been designed to fit simultaneously the two critical dimensions and overlay. This target, which is designed to maximize overlay sensitivity, has been placed in the next 14 nm CMOS product and is expected to make this scatterometry method even more attractive.", "Traditional ellipsometric measurements of copper gratings are limited to Angstrom resolution and are rather insensitive to changes in the critical dimension (CD) or pitch of the structure. By adding another grating per- pendicular and with larger CD and pitch, sensitivity is greatly enhanced. The spectra of one dimensional grat- ings is largely featureless over a wide range of CDs while crossed-gratings exhibit large minima which shift with changing CDs of less than an Angstrom. This improvement is due to plasmonic activity in the crossed-grating, demonstrated in detail here. Mueller matrix element analysis under azimuthal rotation provides information about cross-polarization and plasmon coupling conditions.", "Scatterometry mark design for improvement of the metrology performance is investigated in this joint work by ASML and STMicroelectronics. The studied marks are small, enabling metrology within the device area. The new mark-design approach reduces the effects from the mark-edges during the metrology measurement. For this, small assist-features are integrated in the mark design on the wafer. Thereby the new designs: 1. enlarge the metrology measurement-window, 2. optimize the repeatability and accuracy of the metrology at given mark size, 3. allow added functionality to existing marks within the current mark area, such as monitoring process asymmetry or multiple layer information, 4. allow for mark miniaturization at equal performance, enabling intra-field positioning. With this metrology tool-optical proximity correction (MT-OPC) included in the mark design, the metrology window is enhanced, while improved on-product overlay performance is obtained.", "Along with the increased miniaturization of semiconductor electronic devices, the design rules of advanced semiconductor devices shrink dramatically. [1] One of the main challenges of lithography step is the layer-to-layer overlay control. Furthermore, DPT (Double Patterning Technology) has been adapted for the advanced technology node like 28nm and 14nm, corresponding overlay budget becomes even tighter. [2][3] After the in-die mask registration (pattern placement) measurement is introduced, with the model analysis of a KLA SOV (sources of variation) tool, it\u2019s observed that registration difference between masks is a significant error source of wafer layer-to-layer overlay at 28nm process. [4][5] Mask registration optimization would highly improve wafer overlay performance accordingly. It was reported that a laser based registration control (RegC) process could be applied after the pattern generation or after pellicle mounting and allowed fine tuning of the mask registration. [6]\nIn this paper we propose a novel method of mask registration correction, which can be applied before mask writing based on mask exposure map, considering the factors of mask chip layout, writing sequence, and pattern density distribution. Our experiment data show if pattern density on the mask keeps at a low level, in-die mask registration residue error in 3sigma could be always under 5nm whatever blank type and related writer POSCOR (position correction) file was applied; it proves random error induced by material or equipment would occupy relatively fixed error budget as an error source of mask registration. On the real production, comparing the mask registration difference through critical production layers, it could be revealed that registration residue error of line space layers with higher pattern density is always much larger than the one of contact hole layers with lower pattern density. Additionally, the mask registration difference between layers with similar pattern density could also achieve under 5nm performance. We assume mask registration excluding random error is mostly induced by charge accumulation during mask writing, which may be calculated from surrounding exposed pattern density. Multi-loading test mask registration result shows that with x direction writing sequence, mask registration behavior in x direction is mainly related to sequence direction, but mask registration in y direction would be highly impacted by pattern density distribution map. It proves part of mask registration error is due to charge issue from nearby environment. If exposure sequence is chip by chip for normal multi chip layout case, mask registration of both x and y direction would be impacted analogously, which has also been proved by real data. Therefore, we try to set up a simple model to predict the mask registration error based on mask exposure map, and correct it with the given POSCOR (position correction) file for advanced mask writing if needed.", "In order to handle the upcoming 1x DRAM overlay and yield requirements, metrology needs to evolve to more accurately represent product device patterns while being robust to process effects. One way to address this is to optimize the metrology target design. A viable solution needs to address multiple challenges. The target needs to be resistant to process damage. A single target needs to measure overlay between two or more layers. Targets need to meet design rule and depth of focus requirements under extreme illumination conditions. These must be achieved while maintaining good precision and throughput with an ultra-small target. In this publication, a holistic approach is used to address these challenges, using computationally optimized metrology targets with an advanced overlay control loop.", "As design rule shrink, overlay has been critical factor for semiconductor manufacturing. However, the overlay error which is determined by a conventional measurement with an overlay mark based on IBO and DBO often does not represent the physical placement error in the cell area. The mismatch may arise from the size or pitch difference between the overlay mark and the cell pattern. Pattern distortion caused by etching or CMP also can be a source of the mismatch. In 2014, we have demonstrated that method of overlay measurement in the cell area by using DBM (Design Based Metrology) tool has more accurate overlay value than conventional method by using an overlay mark. We have verified the reproducibility by measuring repeatable patterns in the cell area, and also demonstrated the reliability by comparing with CD-SEM data. We have focused overlay mismatching between overlay mark and cell area until now, further more we have concerned with the cell area having different pattern density and etch loading. There appears a phenomenon which has different overlay values on the cells with diverse patterning environment. In this paper, the overlay error was investigated from cell edge to center. For this experiment, we have verified several critical layers in DRAM by using improved(Better resolution and speed) DBM tool, NGR3520.", "We recently built a 405nm laser based optical interferometry system for 9nm node patterned wafer defect inspection. Defects with volumes smaller than 15nm by 90nm by 35nm have been detected. The success of defect detection relied on accurate mechanical scanning of the wafer and custom engineered image denoising post-processing. To further improve the detection sensitivity, we designed a higher precision XYZ scanning stage and replaced the laser source with an incoherent LED to remove the speckle noise. With these system modifications, we successfully detected both defects and surface contamination particles in bright-field imaging mode. Recently, we have upgraded this system for interferometric defect inspection.", "Coherent extreme ultraviolet beams from tabletop high harmonic generation offer several revolutionary capabilities for observing nanoscale systems on their intrinsic length and time scales. By launching and monitoring hypersonic acoustic waves in such systems, we characterize the mechanical properties of sub-10nm layers and find that the material densities remain close to their bulk values while their elastic properties are significantly modified. Moreover, within the same measurement, by following the heat dissipation dynamics from 30-750nm-wide nanowires, we uncover a new thermal transport regime in which closely-spaced nanoscale heat sources can surprisingly cool more efficiently than widelyspaced heat sources of the same size.", "In this work, the spectral emission proprieties of a droplet-based laser-produced plasma are investigated in the VUV range. These studies are performed with a spectrograph operating from 30 nm to 180 nm at a spectral resolution of 0.1 nm. The emission spectra are recorded for different droplet-based metal fuels such as tin, indium and gallium in the presence of different background gas pressure levels. The experimental results are relevant for alternative light sources that would be needed for future wafer inspection tools. In addition, the experimental results help to determine the Out- Of-Band (OOB) radiation emission of the EUV source. By tuning the type of fuel, the laser energies and the background gas, the LPP light source shows good capabilities to be operated as a tunable light source that covers a spectral emission range from the EUV to the sub-200 nm range.", "Successful implementation of directed self-assembly in high volume manufacturing is contingent upon the ability to control the new DSA-specific local defects such as \u201cdislocations\u201d or \u201cline-shifts\u201d or \u201cfingerprint-like\u201d defects. Conventional defect inspection tools are either limited in resolution (brightfield optical methods) or in the area / number of defects to investigate / review (SEM). Here we explore in depth a scatterometry-based technique that can bridge the gap between area throughput and detection resolution. First we establish the detection methodology for scatterometry-based defect detection, then we compare to established methodology. Careful experiments using scatterometry imaging confirm the ultimate resolution for defect detection of scatterometry-based techniques as low as <1% defect per area sampled \u2013 similar to CD-SEM based detection, while retaining a 2 orders of magnitude higher area sampling rate.", "Aerial image measurement system (AIMSTM) has been widely used for wafer level inspection of mask defects. Reported inspection flows include die-to-die (D2D) and die-to-database (D2DB) methods. For patterns that do not repeat in another die, only the D2DB approach is applicable. The D2DB method requires accurate simulation of AIMS measurements for a mask pattern. An optical vectorial model is needed to depict the mask diffraction effect in this simulation. To accurately simulate the imaging results, a rigorous electro-magnetic field (EMF) model is essential to correctly take account of the EMF scattering induced by the mask topography, which is usually called the mask 3D effect.\nIn this study, the mask 3D model we use is rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA), which calculates the diffraction fields from a single plane wave incidence. A hybrid Hopkins-Abbe method with RCWA is used to calculate the EMF diffraction at a desired accuracy level while keeping the computation time practical. We will compare the speed of the hybrid Hopkins-Abbe method to the rigorous Abbe method.\nThe matching between simulation and experiment is more challenging for AIMS than CD-SEM because its measurements provide full intensity information. Parameters in the mask 3D model such as film stack thickness or film optical properties, is optimized during the fitting process. We will report the fitting results of AIMS images for twodimensional structures with various pitches. By accurately simulating the AIMS measurements, it provides a necessary tool to perform the mask inspection using the D2DB approach and to accurately predict the mask defects.", "With continuously shrinking design rules and corresponding low-k1 lithography, defectivity and yield are increasingly dominated by systematic patterning defects. The size of these yield-limiting defects is shrinking along with feature size, making their detection and verification more difficult. We discuss a novel, holistic approach to pattern defect detection and control, which integrates full chip layout analysis and hybrid wafer metrology data to predict wafer locations with highest probability for defect occurrence. We assess the various components of this flow by an experimental study on a 10 nm BEOL process at IMEC, using state-of-the-art negative tone development (NTD) and triple Litho-Etch patterning process.", "With continuing dimension shrinkage using the TWINSCAN NXT:1950i scanner on the 28nm node and beyond, the imaging depth of focus (DOF) becomes more critical. Focus budget breakdown studies [Ref 1, 5] show that even though the intrafield component stays the same this becomes a larger relative percentage of the overall DOF. Process induced topography along with reduced Process Window can lead to yield limitations and defectivity issues on the wafer. To improve focus margin, a study has been started to determine if some correlations between scanner levelling performance, product layout and topography can be observed. Both topography and levelling intrafield fingerprints show a large systematic component that seems to be product related. In particular, scanner levelling measurement maps present a lot of similarities with the layout of the product. The present paper investigates the possibility to model the level sensor\u2019s measured height as a function of layer design densities or perimeter data of the product. As one component of the systematics from the level sensor measurements is process induced topography due to previous deposition, etching and CMP, several layer density parameters were extracted from the GDS\u2019s. These were combined through a multiple variable analysis (PLS: Partial Least Square regression) to determine the weighting of each layer and each parameter. Current work shows very promising results using this methodology, with description quality up to 0.8 R2 and expected prediction quality up to 0.78 Q2. Since product layout drives some intrafield focus component it is also important to be able to assess intrafield focus uniformity from post processing. This has been done through a hyper dense focus map experiment which is presented in this paper.", "It is increasingly difficult to determine degree of completion of the patterning and the distribution at the DRAM Cell Patterns. When we research DRAM Device Cell Pattern, there are three big problems currently, it is as follows. First, due to etch loading, it is difficult to predict the potential defect. Second, due to under layer topology, it is impossible to demonstrate the influence of the hotspot. Finally, it is extremely difficult to predict final ACI pattern by the photo simulation, because current patterning process is double patterning technology which means photo pattern is completely different from final etch pattern. Therefore, if the hotspot occurs in wafer, it is very difficult to find it.\nCD-SEM is the most common pattern measurement tool in semiconductor fabrication site. CD-SEM is used to accurately measure small region of wafer pattern primarily. Therefore, there is no possibility of finding places where unpredictable defect occurs. Even though, \"Current Defect detector\" can measure a wide area, every chip has same pattern issue, the detector cannot detect critical hotspots. Because defect detecting algorithm of bright field machine is based on image processing, if same problems occur on compared and comparing chip, the machine cannot identify it. Moreover this instrument is not distinguished the difference of distribution about 1nm~3nm. So, \"Defect detector\" is difficult to handle the data for potential weak point far lower than target CD.\nIn order to solve those problems, another method is needed. In this paper, we introduce the analysis method of the DRAM Cell Pattern Hotspot.", "High-end semiconductor lithography requirements for CD, focus and overlay control drive the need for diffraction-based metrology1,2,3,4 and integrated metrology5. In the advanced nodes, more complex lithography techniques (such as multiple patterning), use of multi-layer overlay measurements in process control, advanced device designs (such as advanced FinFET), as well as advanced materials (like hardmasks) are introduced. These pose new challenges for lithometro cycle time, cost, process control and metrology accuracy. In this publication a holistic approach is taken to face these challenges via a novel target design, a brand new implementation of multi-layer overlay measurement capability in diffraction-based mode and integrated metrology.", "The continuing trend of shrinking dimension and the related specifications requires tightening of control loops. To support the tighter control loops, the metrology sampling plans will require increasing sampling density and frequency. This study shows that tighter control of scanner focus and AEI CD and profile parameters requires sampling schemes with intra-field measurement points, and a frequent update of the corrections. This drives the need for high-speed smalltarget metrology. Experiments show that this can be achieved by the YieldStar angle resolved scatterometer, demonstrating measurements on areas of 16\u00d716\u03bcm2 for focus metrology and 12\u00d712\u03bcm2 for CD metrology, at a MAM time below 0.5s.", "Copper interconnects have been adopted in advanced semiconductor manufacturing due to benefits of reduced RC delay, cross talk and power consumption. With each technology node, interconnects reduce in size resulting in increased line resistivity, a critical metric in determining the device performance. Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) and Copper Chemical Mechanical Polishing (Cu CMP) are two of the key back end of the line (BEOL) processes that affect the interconnect performance. Due to variations from incoming processes and the inherent variability induced by these processes, dielectric trench depth and resulting copper line height variations that can potentially result from these processes have direct impact to RC delay.\nTraditional inline metrology methods used are time consuming and do not provide the needed wafer level metrics. In addition, measurement of remaining dielectric thickness on solid pads is not a good representative of the actual device structures and has been inaccurate for process due to dishing of the copper pads. Efficient control of BEOL processes requires measurement of metal line thickness and other critical profile parameters from which resistance can be extracted. In order to relate BEOL process steps and understand their interactions, it is necessary to have a directly comparable measurement methodology on a similar measurement structure.\nOver the past several years, scatterometry has been proven as the only metrology method to provide the full profile information of the Cu lines. Scatterometry is a diffraction based optical measurement technique using Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), where light diffracted from a periodic structure is used to characterize the details of profile. Unique algorithms, such as Holistic Metrology can be used to make the scatterometry development process faster.\nIn this paper, we will present how scatterometry can be used to measure copper line height on 3D structures and how feed forward from RIE can be applied for control of Cu CMP process for 20nm technology node. The importance of incoming trench depth variations is demonstrated for CMP polish time control in order to stabilize the copper line height. Validation data is presented for different scatterometry models including accuracy, repeatability and DoE tracking. Electrical resistance is shown to correlate to the copper trench profile measured by scatterometry. The paper will demonstrate the capability for reducing copper line height variation and the correlation of the reducing trench height variation to improved stabilization of electrical resistance.", "Hybrid metrology (HM) is the practice of combining measurements from multiple toolset types in order to enable or improve metrology for advanced structures. HM is implemented in two phases: Phase-1 includes readiness of the infrastructure to transfer processed data from the first toolset to the second. Phase-2 infrastructure allows simultaneous transfer and optimization of raw data between toolsets such as spectra, images, traces \u2013 co-optimization. We discuss the extension of Phase-1 to include direct high-bandwidth communication between toolsets using a hybrid server, enabling seamless fab deployment and further laying the groundwork for Phase-2 high volume manufacturing (HVM) implementation. An example of the communication protocol shows the information that can be used by the hybrid server, differentiating its capabilities from that of a host-based approach. We demonstrate qualification and production implementation of the hybrid server approach using CD-SEM and OCD toolsets for complex 20nm and 14nm applications. Finally we discuss the roadmap for Phase-2 HM implementation through use of the hybrid server.", "Integrate circuit (IC) technology is going through multiple changes in terms of patterning techniques (multiple patterning, EUV and DSA), device architectures (FinFET, nanowire, graphene) and patterning scale (few nanometers). These changes require tight controls on processes and measurements to achieve the required device performance, and challenge the metrology and process control in terms of capability and quality. Multivariate data with complex nonlinear trends and correlations generally cannot be described well by mathematical or parametric models but can be relatively easily learned by computing machines and used to predict or extrapolate. This paper introduces the predictive metrology approach which has been applied to three different applications. Machine learning and predictive analytics have been leveraged to accurately predict dimensions of EUV resist patterns down to 18 nm half pitch leveraging resist shrinkage patterns. These patterns could not be directly and accurately measured due to metrology tool limitations. Machine learning has also been applied to predict the electrical performance early in the process pipeline for deep trench capacitance and metal line resistance. As the wafer goes through various processes its associated cost multiplies. It may take days to weeks to get the electrical performance readout. Predicting the electrical performance early on can be very valuable in enabling timely actionable decision such as rework, scrap, feedforward, feedback predicted information or information derived from prediction to improve or monitor processes. This paper provides a general overview of machine learning and advanced analytics application in the advanced semiconductor development and manufacturing.", "Hybrid metrology, e.g. the combination of several measurement techniques to determine critical dimensions, is an important approach to meet the needs of semiconductor industry. A proper use of hybrid metrology may not only yield more reliable estimates for the quantitative characterization of 3-D structures but also a more realistic estimation of the corresponding uncertainties. Recent developments at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) feature the combination of optical critical dimension (OCD) measurements and scanning electron microscope (SEM) results. The hybrid methodology offers the potential to make measurements of essential 3-D attributes that may not be otherwise feasible. However, combining techniques gives rise to essential challenges in error analysis and comparing results from different instrument models, especially the effect of systematic and highly correlated errors in the measurement on the \u00ac\u03c72 function that is minimized. Both hypothetical examples and measurement data are used to illustrate solutions to these challenges.", "The on product overlay specification and Advanced Process Control (APC) is getting extremely challenging particularly after the introduction of multi-patterning applications like Spacer Assisted Double Patterning (SADP) and multipatterning techniques like N-repetitive Litho-Etch steps (LEN, N \u2265 2). When the latter is considered, most of the intrafield overlay contributors drop out of the overlay budget. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the scanner settings (like dose, illumination settings, etc.) as well as the subsequent processing steps can be made very similar for two consecutive Litho-Etch layers. The major overlay contributor that may require additional attention is the Image Placement Error (IPE). When the inter-layer overlay is considered, controlling the intra-field overlay contribution gets more complicated. In addition to the IPE contribution, the TWINSCANTM lens fingerprint in combination with the exposure settings is going to play a role as well. Generally speaking, two subsequent functional layers have different exposure settings. This results in a (non-reticle) additional overlay contribution.\nIn this paper, we have studied the wafer overlay correction capability by RegC\u00ae in addition to the TWINSCANTM intrafield corrections to improve the on product overlay performance. RegC\u00ae is a reticle intra-volume laser writing technique that causes a predictable deformation element (RegC\u00ae deformation element) inside the quartz (Qz) material of a reticle. This technique enables to post-process an existing reticle to correct for instance for IPE. Alternatively, a pre-determined intra-field fingerprint can be added to the reticle such that it results in a straight field after exposure. This second application might be very powerful to correct for instance for (cold) lens fingerprints that cannot be corrected by the scanner itself. Another possible application is the intra-field processing fingerprint. One should realize that a RegC\u00ae treatment of a reticle generally results in global distortion of the reticle. This is not a problem as long as these global distortions can be corrected by the TWINSCANTM system (currently up to the third order). It is anticipated that the combination of the RegC\u00ae and the TWINSCANTM corrections act as complementary solutions. These solutions perfectly fit into the ASML Litho InSight (LIS) product in which feedforward and feedback corrections based on YieldStar overlay measurements are used to improve the on product overlay.", "On-product overlay can be improved through the use of context data from the fab and the scanner. Continuous improvements in lithography and processing performance over the past years have resulted in consequent overlay performance improvement for critical layers. Identification of the remaining factors causing systematic disturbances and inefficiencies will further reduce overlay. By building a context database, mappings between context, fingerprints and alignment & overlay metrology can be learned through techniques from pattern recognition and data mining. We relate structure (\u2018patterns\u2019) in the metrology data to relevant contextual factors. Once understood, these factors could be moved to the known effects (e.g. the presence of systematic fingerprints from reticle writing error or lens and reticle heating). Hence, we build up a knowledge base of known effects based on data. Outcomes from such an integral (\u2018holistic\u2019) approach to lithography data analysis may be exploited in a model-based predictive overlay controller that combines feedback and feedforward control [1]. Hence, the available measurements from scanner, fab and metrology equipment are combined to reveal opportunities for further overlay improvement which would otherwise go unnoticed.", "This paper demonstrates the synergy between X-rays techniques and scatterometry, and the benefits to combine the data to improve the accuracy and precision for in-line metrology. Particular example is given to show that the hybridization addresses the challenges of aggressive patterning. In 10nm node back-end-of-line (BEOL) integration, we show that the hybridized data between scatterometry and simultaneous X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) provided the closest dimensional correlation to TEM results compared to the individual technique and CDSEM.", "Grazing-Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) offers the ability to probe large sample areas, providing three-dimensional structural information at high detail in a thin film geometry. In this study we exploit the application of GISAXS to structures formed at one step of the LiNe (Liu-Nealey) flow using chemical patterns for directed self-assembly of block copolymer films. Experiments conducted at the Argonne National Laboratory provided scattering patterns probing film characteristics at both parallel and normal directions to the surface. We demonstrate the application of new computational methods to construct models based on scattering measured. Such analysis allows for extraction of structural characteristics at unprecedented detail.", "CD uniformity requirements at 20nm and more advanced nodes have challenged the precision limits of CD-SEM metrology, conventionally used for scanner qualification and in-line focus/dose monitoring on product wafers. Optical CD metrology has consequently gained adoption for these applications because of its superior precision, but has been limited adopted, due to challenges with long time-to-results and robustness to process variation. Both of these challenges are due to the limitations imposed by geometric modeling of the photoresist (PR) profile as required by conventional RCWA-based scatterometry. Signal Response Metrology (SRM) is a new technique that obviates the need for geometric modeling by directly correlating focus, dose, and CD to the spectral response of a scatterometry tool. Consequently, it suggests superior accuracy and robustness to process variation for focus/dose monitoring, as well as reducing the time to set up a new measurement recipe from days to hours. This work describes the fundamental concepts of SRM and the results of its application to lithography metrology and control. These results include time to results and measurement performance data on Focus, Dose and CD measurements performed on real devices and on design rule metrology targets.", "Helium ion microscopy (HIM) has been used to study nanopatterns formed in block copolymer (BCP) thin films. Owing to its\u2019 small spot size, minimal forward scattering of the incident ion and reduced velocity compared to electrons of comparable energy, HIM has considerable advantages and provides pattern information and resolution not attainable with other commercial microscopic techniques.\nIn order to realize the full potential of BCP nanolithography in producing high density ultra-small features, the dimensions and geometry of these BCP materials will need to be accurately characterized through pattern formation, development and pattern transfer processes. The preferred BCP pattern inspection techniques (to date) are principally atomic force microscopy (AFM) and secondary electron microscopy (SEM) but suffer disadvantages in poor lateral resolution (AFM) and the ability to discriminate individual polymer domains (SEM). SEM suffers from reduced resolution when a more surface sensitive low accelerating voltage is used and low surface signal when a high accelerating voltage is used. In addition to these drawbacks, SEM can require the use of a conductive coating on these insulating materials and this reduces surface detail as well as increasing the dimensions of coated features. AFM is limited by the dimensions of the probe tip and a skewing of lateral dimension results. This can be eliminated through basic geometry for large sparse features, but when dense small features need to be characterized AFM lacks reliability. With this in mind, BCP inspection by HIM can offer greater insight into block ordering, critical dimensions and, critically, line edge roughness (LER) a critical parameter whose measurement is well suited to HIM because of its\u2019 enhanced edge contrast.\nIn this work we demonstrate the resolution capabilities of HIM using various BCP systems (lamellar and cylinder structures). Imaging of BCP patterns of low molecular weight (MW)/low feature size which challenges the resolution of HIM technique. Further, studies of BCP patterns with domains of similar chemistry will be presented demonstrating the superior chemical contrast compared to SEM. From the data, HIM excels as a BCP inspection tool in four distinct areas. Firstly, HIM offers higher resolution at standard imaging conditions than SEM. Secondly, the signal generated from He+ is more surface sensitive and enables visualization of features that cannot be resolved using SEM. Thirdly; superior chemical contrast enables the imaging of un etched samples with almost identical chemical composition. Finally, dimensional measurement accuracy is high and consistent with requirements for advanced lithographic masks.", "Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), with nanometer spatial resolution, has the capability to monitor chemical composition, strain, and activated dopants and is a promising metrology tool to aid the semiconductor R&D processes. This paper addresses the major challenges which limit the application of TERS from routine measurement: the lack of comparability, reproducibility, calibration, and standardization. To address these issues, we have developed a robust test structure and the ability to generate high-quality tips using a high volume manufacturing (HVM) approach. The qualifying data will be presented.", "While semiconductor manufacturing moves toward the 7nm node for logic and 15nm node for memory, an increased emphasis has been placed on reducing the influence known contributors have toward the on product overlay budget. With a machine learning technique known as function approximation, we use a neural network to gain insight to how known contributors, such as those collected with scanner metrology, influence the on product overlay budget. The result is a sufficiently trained function that can approximate overlay for all wafers exposed with the lithography system. As a real world application, inline metrology can be used to measure overlay for a few wafers while using the trained function to approximate overlay vector maps for the entire lot of wafers. With the approximated overlay vector maps for all wafers coming off the track, a process engineer can redirect wafers or lots with overlay signatures outside the standard population to offline metrology for excursion validation. With this added flexibility, engineers will be given more opportunities to catch wafers that need to be reworked, resulting in improved yield. The quality of the derived corrections from measured overlay metrology feedback can be improved using the approximated overlay to trigger, which wafers should or shouldn\u2019t be, measured inline. As a development or integration engineer the approximated overlay can be used to gain insight into lots and wafers used for design of experiments (DOE) troubleshooting. In this paper we will present the results of a case study that follows the machine learning function approximation approach to data analysis, with production overlay measured on an inline metrology system at SK hynix.", "Multiple electron beam SEMs enable detecting structures of few nanometer in diameter at much higher throughputs than possible with single beam electron microscopes at comparable electron probe parameters. Although recent multiple beam SEM development has already demonstrated a large speed increase1, higher throughputs are still required to match the needs of many semiconductor applications2. We demonstrate the next step in the development of multi-beam SEMs by increasing the number of beams and the current per beam. The modularity of the multi-beam concept ensures that design changes in the multi-beam SEM are minimized.", "With the introduction of N2x and N1x process nodes, leading-edge factories are facing challenging demands of shrinking design margins. Previously un-corrected high-order signatures, and un-compensated temporal changes of high-order signatures, carry an important potential for improvement of on-product overlay (OPO). Until recently, static corrections per exposure (CPE), applied separately from the main APC correction, have been the industry\u2019s standard for critical layers [1], [2]. This static correction is setup once per device and layer and then updated periodically or when a machine change point generates a new overlay signature. This is a non-ideal setup for two reasons. First, any drift or sudden shift in tool signature between two CPE update periods can cause worse OPO and a higher rework rate, or, even worse, lead to yield loss at end of line. Second, these corrections are made from full map measurements that can be in excess of 1,000 measurements per wafer [3].\nAdvanced overlay control algorithms utilizing Run-to-Run (R2R) CPE can be used to reduce the overlay signatures on product in High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) environments. In this paper, we demonstrate the results of a R2R CPE control scheme in HVM. The authors show an improvement up to 20% OPO Mean+3Sigma values on several critical immersion layers at the 28nm and 14 nm technology nodes, and a reduction of out-of-spec residual points per wafer (validated on full map). These results are attained by closely tracking process tool signature changes by means of APC, and with an affordable metrology load which is significantly smaller than full wafer measurements.", "The capabilities and limitations of angular scatterometry for a structure pitch much less than the optical wavelength are experimentally investigated using a 100-nm pitch Al-wire grid polarizer on a SiO2 substrate. Three CW laser sources of wavelengths (244 nm, 405 nm and 633 nm) are used to measure the 0-order diffraction (reflection) across an incident angle range of 8\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. The grating profile is defined by seven parameters (pitch, bottom linewidth, top linewidth, fused silica undercut, Al thickness, horizontal and vertical extent of top rounding). Rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) simulations show that the reflectivity versus angle results are sensitive to changes in all of these parameters. The simulations act as a baseline library for the scatterometry measurements. Fitting the experimental curves with the corresponding simulation parameters results in a determination of the grating profile. As expected the shorter wavelength measurements provide the most sensitivity, but good precision is obtained at all three wavelengths. The measurements are in good agreement with destructive cross section scanning electron microscopy measurements.", "While feature size in lithography process continuously becomes smaller, defect sizes on blank wafers become more comparable to device sizes. Defects with nm-scale characteristic size could be misclassified by automated optical inspection (AOI) and require post-processing for proper classification. Atomic force microscope (AFM) is known to provide high lateral and the highest vertical resolution by mechanical probing among all techniques. However, its low throughput and tip life in addition to the laborious efforts for finding the defects have been the major limitations of this technique. In this paper we introduce automatic defect review (ADR) AFM as a post-inspection metrology tool for defect study and classification for 300 mm blank wafers and to overcome the limitations stated above. The ADR AFM provides high throughput, high resolution, and non-destructive means for obtaining 3D information for nm-scale defect review and classification.", "Feedback control of overlay errors to the scanner is a well-established technique in semiconductor manufacturing [1]. Typically, overlay errors are measured, and then modeled by least-squares fitting to an overlay model. Overlay models are typically Cartesian polynomial functions of position within the wafer (Xw, Yw), and of position within the field (Xf, Yf). The coefficients from the data fit can then be fed back to the scanner to reduce overlay errors in future wafer exposures, usually via a historically weighted moving average. In this study, rather than using the standard Cartesian formulation, we examine overlay models using Zernike polynomials to represent the wafer-level terms, and Legendre polynomials to represent the field-level terms. Zernike and Legendre polynomials can be selected to have the same fitting capability as standard polynomials (e.g., second order in X and Y, or third order in X and Y). However, Zernike polynomials have the additional property of being orthogonal over the unit disk, which makes them appropriate for the wafer-level model, and Legendre polynomials are orthogonal over the unit square, which makes them appropriate for the field-level model. We show several benefits of Zernike/Legendre-based models in this investigation in an Advanced Process Control (APC) simulation using highly-sampled fab data. First, the orthogonality property leads to less interaction between the terms, which makes the lot-to-lot variation in the fitted coefficients smaller than when standard polynomials are used. Second, the fitting process itself is less coupled \u2013 fitting to a lower-order model, and then fitting the residuals to a higher order model gives very similar results as fitting all of the terms at once. This property makes fitting techniques such as dual pass or cascading [2] unnecessary, and greatly simplifies the options available for the model recipe. The Zernike/Legendre basis gives overlay performance (mean plus 3 sigma of the residuals) that is the same as standard Cartesian polynomials, but with stability similar to the dual-pass recipe. Finally, we show that these properties are intimately tied to the sample plan on the wafer, and that the model type and sampling must be considered at the same time to demonstrate the benefits of an orthogonal set of functions.", "This paper focuses on orthogonal model corrections where model parameters do not influence each other as long as the measurement layout is sufficiently symmetric. For the grid correction we used Zernike polynomials, and for the intrafield correction we used a two-dimensional set of Legendre polynomials. We enabled these corrections by developing a transformation matrix as an exposure tool is incapable of correcting such orthogonal polynomials. Simulation with OVALiS shows that the linear parameters get stabilized by several factors when using a combined Zernike/Legendre model. The correlation between linear and higher order parameters disappears, and overlay mean plus 3-sigma improves up to ~15\u201320%. Simulated data agrees well with experimental and electrical data. Additionally, we introduced an interpolated metric that probed the wafer and field with a dense grid. This interpolated metric showed that the Zernike/Legendre model-based correction does not cause over-correction like that seen on standard polynomial models. We have tested higher order process corrections comprehensively by enabling an orthogonal model, as well as by making use of interpolated metrics to monitor the overlay performance. These orthogonal models can be implemented in the production line based on inline overlay data where interpolated metrics will ensure that there is no over-correction and no negative impact on product.", "In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of scatterometry for the 3D isolation mounts on the substrate by applying PML in RCWA. We analyze the reflectance from the silicon and resist single mount and the silicon double mounts on the silicon substrate. First, we investigate the beam width dependences of reflectance. Second, we show the propagation properties of the electromagnetic fields propagating for the isolation mounts on the silicon substrate. Third, we show the reflectance properties by changing the mount length and width on the Si substrate. Finally, we examine the wavelength properties of reflectance calculated by changing the mount length, width and height for single mount and the silicon mount positions for the double silicon mounts. Then, we understand the scatterometry observation is possible in several microns beam width.", "Persistently shrinking design rules and increasing process complexity require tight overlay control thereby making it imperative to choose the most suitable overlay measurement technique and complementary target design. In this paper we describe an assessment of various target designs from FEOL to BEOL on 20-nm process. Both scatterometry and imaging based methodology were reviewed for several key layers on A500LCM tool, which enables the use of both technologies. Different sets of targets were carefully designed and printed, taking into consideration the process and optical properties of each layer. The optimal overlay target for a given layer was chosen based on its measurement performance.", "In advanced semiconductor industries, the overlay error budget is getting tighter due to shrinkage in technology. To fulfill the tighter overlay requirements, gaining every nanometer of improved overlay is very important in order to accelerate yield in high-volume manufacturing (HVM) fabs. To meet the stringent overlay requirements and to overcome other unforeseen situations, it is becoming critical to eliminate the smallest imperfections in the metrology targets used for overlay metrology. For standard cases, the overlay metrology recipe is selected based on total measurement uncertainty (TMU). However, under certain circumstances, inaccuracy due to target imperfections can become the dominant contributor to the metrology uncertainty and cannot be detected and quantified by the standard TMU. For optical-based overlay (OBO) metrology targets, mark asymmetry is a common issue which can cause measurement inaccuracy, and it is not captured by standard TMU. In this paper, a new calibration method, Archer Self-Calibration (ASC), has been established successfully in HVM fabs to improve overlay accuracy on image-based overlay (IBO) metrology targets. Additionally, a new color selection methodology has been developed for the overlay metrology recipe as part of this calibration method. In this study, Qmerit-calibrated data has been used for run-to-run control loop at multiple devices. This study shows that color filter can be chosen more precisely with the help of Qmerit data. Overlay stability improved by 10~20% with best color selection, without causing any negative impact to the products. Residual error, as well as overlay mean plus 3-sigma, showed an improvement of up to 20% when Qmerit-calibrated data was used. A 30% improvement was seen in certain electrical data associated with tested process layers.", "Mass production of nanostructured surfaces relies on the periodic repetition of micrometre scale patterns. A unit cell with nanometre features in the micrometre size range is repeated thousands of times. The ensemble can used as a diffraction grating for visible light. The relative intensity distribution of the diffraction orders is characteristic for the grating and sensitive to nanometre scale changes. A newly designed subwavelength diffraction setup allows the measurement in real time of the diffraction pattern of an illuminated polymer grating with only one detector image. The setup records diffraction patterns of, for example, polymer gratings with intentionally low scattering contrast and line features ranging from 610 to 80 nm. Thus, sub-100 nm features can be traced. The comparison of the measured diffraction patterns with simulated patterns allows to sense nanometre scale deviations from fabrication goals.", "The performance of CD-SEMs directly affects the measured values of critical dimensions (CDs) at the time of their measurement. Tracking the performance of CD-SEMs is necessary to establish trust in their results and provide guidance for preventive maintenance and tune-ups. When the measured CDs are out of specification in manufacturing, it is crucial to determine whether this is due to process variation or the metrology tool itself. Multiple methods that use linewidth measurements have been employed thus far; however, they suffer from linewidth variations on the wafer, as well as from variations of line edge and linewidth roughness. Here, we report a method that is capable of providing a quantitative extraction of the SEM performance based on advanced algorithms. The method is independent of linewidth, line edge roughness and linewidth roughness, and has high sensitivity. This software, QSEM, was developed to automatically evaluate image quality and assign a value to that quality. The image quality value is based on multiple factors such as noise, sharpness, analysis of histograms, and contrast. The sensitivity of the software was evaluated; a good correlation between image quality results and linewidth variation due to SEM performance was established. Using QSEM to analyze SEM images allows the performance of CDSEMs to be tracked for proper calibration and preventive maintenance, as well as to resolve the dispute between failure in the process or the metrology.", "For several decades, the semiconductor industry has been controlling site flatness of the starting wafer material by defining tight specs on industry-standard site flatness metrics such as SFQR (Site Frontsurface-referenced least sQuares/Range) and ESFQR (Edge Site Frontsurface-referenced least sQuares/Range) that scale with technology nodes. The need for controlling site flatness of the starting material stems from previous research that shows that site flatness directly impacts lithography defocus. The wafer flatness variation changes significantly due to wafer processing downstream such as CMP, etch, and film deposition. Hence, for 2X nm and smaller technology nodes with very stringent focus process windows, it is critical to control wafer flatness variations at critical steps along the semiconductor process flow. In this paper, the capability of an interferometer-based patterned wafer metrology tool to predict lithography defocus is validated by comparison to scanner leveling data. The patterned wafer metrology tool is used to characterize the impact of near-edge flatness changes on the critical dimension (CD) of the contact holes due to different edge CMP process conditions. The results of the characterization illustrate how a site flatness specification or threshold can be developed for critical patterning steps. The paper also illustrates how the patterned wafer metrology tool can be used to identify processes causing site flatness variations. Finally, the site flatness variation at these processes can be monitored using the pattern wafer metrology tool to detect process drifts and excursion before patterning.", "Scatterometry critical dimension (SCD) technology in state of the art semiconductor manufacturing is a well-accepted and powerful technique to determine profile properties such as critical dimensions, sidewall angles, trench depths as well as layer thicknesses of microelectronic structures. The amount and combination of information receivable via SCD measurements makes it, as long as interpreted correctly and incoming process variations especially incoming material variations are well understood, superior to other measurement techniques such as critical dimension scanning electron microscopy (CDSEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM). For high throughput inline process monitoring and feedback SCD models are usually generated for uniform gratings having fixed pitches representing dense areas of the microelectronic chip design. However, for purposes such as improvement in process tool matching, wafer uniformity or optical proximity correction (OPC) it is of great value if the measured test patterns do have different layout properties being representative for other design elements and styles as well. In this paper a through pitch SCD measurement within the shallow trench isolation (STI) layer on the 28nm node is presented. This approach allows to interpret, to tune and to monitor process tool behavior for different pattern densities using only one single specially designed lithography mask. Two different use cases are shown: for varying pitch sizes either the designed line CD or the designed space CD is kept constant. General SCD modelling approaches and examples to illustrate the key idea and practical use will be provided.", "Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is widely used to measure Critical Dimensions (CD) in semiconductor lithography processes. Correlation between the CD-SEM metrology and target profile has drawing attention from metrology community [1]. In this paper, we use a recently developed CD-SEM simulator [2-3] to investigate some artifacts of SEM metrology. The simulation consists of two parts. First part is a stochastic resist modeling for lines and spaces through pitch, exposure dose and focus. Second part is CD-SEM simulation. Both CD and LWR extracted from experimental CD-SEM images were used to train the SEM model. Two types of artifacts were found to be metrology dependent: the first artifact is that a CD-SEM measures CD at various heights across pitch for the same SEM threshold. The second artifact is a misleading CD measurement for trenches not fully developed. By overlapping the CD-SEM simulation with 3D lithography simulation, correlation between CD-SEM metrology and target 3D profile is studied. Finally, a Process Window (PW) analysis based on both experiment and simulation is presented, using the simulated features and SEM images to correct the experimental PW.", "Advanced design nodes require more complex lithography techniques, such as double patterning, as well as advanced materials like hard masks. This poses new challenge for overlay metrology and process control. In this publication several step are taken to face these challenges. Accurate overlay metrology solutions are demonstrated for advanced memory devices.", "For advanced lithography metrology, SCD (Scatterometry Critical Dimension) is a common metrology technique applied to control processes. SCD has the capability to report accurate data information such as CD (Critical Dimensions), photoresist SWA (Side Wall Angle) and photoresist HT (Height). The shape of photoresist correlates with inline process controllers, namely scanner focus and dose. However, SCD is a model-based metrology method. In order to decode the process controllers, it requires computation from a geometric model. Once the model extracts the resist shape information from the spectra, one needs further correlation of those geometric parameters with the process controllers for monitoring. Thus, information loss through multiple modeling is a major concern. Indeed, during data transformation, noise and model approximation can distort the signals, in other words, the critical parameters, focus and dose, may not be measured accurately. This study therefore seeks a methodology to monitor focus and dose with the least amount of information transformation. Signal Response Metrology is a new measurement technique that obviates the need for geometric modeling by directly correlating focus, dose or CD to the spectral response of a SCD-based metrology tool.", "Electrostatic discharge (ESD) problem resulting from charges on wafers is a serious concern in IC manufacturing. As is discovered in our paper, three types of defect, AA (active area) damage, IMD (Inter Metal Dielectric) crack and Via hole W corrosion that are confirmed to be induced by lithography process related ESD charging effect. We carefully studied the mechanism of these ESD charging effect by DOE splits and succeeded to dig out that these electric charge major comes from the lithography develop process. In the lithography coating and developing wafer process, the wafer will be at high spin speed at many of the steps which will easy help to store the electric charge on the wafer. In our study, the rinse step in developing process is the most key factor to store the electric charge on wafer. In generally, the higher rinse speed, the higher positive electric charge. Furthermore, we also discovered that the different step in develop rinse process have different impact on charge level, in which the acceleration and deceleration step has the highest charge voltage.\nAs to minimize and eliminate the ESD damage in lithography process, we finally carry out the simplified recipe optimization solution which only need optimize for the develop rinse speed with different in-coming surface charge level and process application, so that can be easy implemented in the worldwide fabs.", "Scanner Focus window of the lithographic process becomes much smaller due to the shrink of the device node and multipatterning approach. Consequently, the required performance of scanner focus becomes tighter and more complicated. Focus control/monitoring methods such as \u201cfield-by-field focus control\u201d or \u201cintra-field focus control\u201d is a necessity. Moreover, tight scanner focus performance requirement starts to raise another fundamental question: accuracy of the reported scanner focus.\nThe insufficient accuracy of the reported scanner focus using the existing methods originates from:\na) Focus measurement quality, which is due to low sensitivity of measured targets, especially around the nominal production focus.\nb) The scanner focus is estimated using special targets, e.g. large pitch target and not using the device-like structures (irremovable aberration impact).\nBoth of these factors are eliminated using KLA-Tencor proprietary \u201cFocus Offset\u201d technology.", "The Liu-Nealey (LiNe) chemo-epitaxy Directed Self Assembly flow has been screened thoroughly in the past years in terms of defects. Various types of DSA specific defects have been identified and best known methods have been developed to be able to get sufficient S/N for defect inspection to help understand the root causes for the various defect types and to reduce the defect levels to prepare the process for high volume manufacturing. Within this process development, SEM-review and defect classification play a key role. This paper provides an overview of the challenges that DSA brings also in this metrology aspect and we will provide successful solutions in terms of making the automated defect review. In addition, a new Real Time Automated Defect Classification (RT-ADC) will be introduced that can save up to 90% in the time required for manual defect classification. This will enable a much larger sampling for defect review, resulting in a better understanding of signatures and behaviors of various DSA specific defect types, such as dislocations, 1-period bridges and line wiggling.", "Embedded defect types continue to be a challenge for scanning electron microscopes (SEM) review solutions. Though high energy beams can be used to image these defect types, they cause damage to the reviewed sites. Also, imaging all review sites at higher electron energy has often resulted in low topography surface defects to be non-visible due to high penetration depth. In this work we present a method in which defects are reviewed at non-destructive lower electron energies and only the non-visual review sites are reviewed at higher electron energies to image any potential additional defect types. The non-visual defects are identified inline during review using automatic defect classification attributes.", "In order to optimize the time to market of the newest technology nodes and maximize their profitability, advanced semiconductor manufacturers need to adapt their yield enhancement strategies to their current development stage. During very early development, gross Defectivity at some critical process steps often makes it impractical to use broadband plasma or laser scanning micro-defect patterned wafer inspection techniques: such sensitive defect inspections capture a large number of defects, producing wafer defect maps so heavily populated that even wafer level signature are difficult to visualize.", "As the technology node of semiconductor industry is being driven into more advanced 28 nm and beyond, the critical dimension (CD) error budget at after-development inspection (ADI) stage and its control are more and more important and difficult (1-4). 1 nm or even 0.5 nm CD difference is critical for process control. 0.5~1 nm drift of poly linewidth will result in a detectable off-target drift of device performance. The 0.5~1 nm CD drift of hole or metal linewidth on the backend interconnecting layers can potentially contribute to the bridging of metal patterns to vias, and thereby impact yield. In this paper, we studied one function in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurement, i.e. the adjustment of brightness and contrast (ABC). We revealed how the step of addressing focus and even the choice of addressing pattern may bring in a systematic error into the CD measurement. This provides a unique insight in the CD measurement and the measurement consistency of through-pitch (TP) patterns and functional patterns.", "Layout pattern density impacts mask critical dimension uniformity (MCDU) as well as wafer critical dimension uniformity (WCDU) performances in some aspects. In patterning the dense contact array with negative tone development (NTD) process, the abrupt pattern density change around the array edge of a NTD clear tone reticle arises as a very challenging issue for achieving satisfactory WCDU. Around the array boundary, apart from the MCDU greatly impacted by the abrupt pattern density change, WCDU in lithographic process is also significantly influenced by the optical flare and chemical flare effects. This study investigates the pattern density effect induced MCDU and WCDU variations. Various pattern densities are generated by the combination of fixed array pattern and various sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF) extension regions for quantifying the separated WCD variation budget contributed by MCD variation, chemical flare effect and optical flare effect. With the proper pattern density modulation outside the array pattern on a clear tone reticle, MCD variation across array can be eliminated, optical flare and chemical flare effects induced WCD variation is also greatly suppressed.", "As integrated circuit (IC) industry steps into immersion lithography\u2019s era, defectivity in photolithography becomes more complex which requires more efforts in the analysis and solution finding when compared to traditional dry lithographic process. In this paper, we focus on one type of immersion defect from memory or flash memory devices with typical mask layouts. Since the use of self-aligned double patterning (SADP) or other double patterning techniques, the original single pattern layer has to be split into 2 mask layers: logic area vs cell area. One characteristic of such split process is that the total mask transmission rate (TR) is above 70%, with extended open area and a pattern area with a transmission rate close to 50%. This indicates that it may have special defect mechanism and type compared to logic devices. We have found one type of residue defect with center ring-like map. We have studied this defect with different development recipes and analyzed their underlying mechanisms. We have also studied the effect of different immersion photoresists including types with top-coating and without top-coating, as well as the effect of bottom anti-reflection coating (BARC) substrate (organic-BARC/Si-BARC). The results of our study will be presented and discussed.", "The use of purified carbon dioxide (CO2) has become a reality for leading edge 193 nm immersion lithography scanners. Traditionally, both dry and immersion 193 nm lithographic processes have constantly purged the optics stack with ultrahigh purity compressed dry air (UHPCDA). CO2 has been utilized for a similar purpose as UHPCDA. Airborne molecular contamniation (AMC) purification technologies and analytical measurement methods have been extensively developed to support the Lithography Tool Manufacturers purity requirements. This paper covers the analytical tests and characterizations carried out to assess impurity removal from 3.0 N CO2 (beverage grade) for its final utilization in 193 nm and EUV scanners.", "The technological challenges that have been overcome to make extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) a reality have been enormous1. This vacuum driven technology poses significant purity challenges for the gases employed for purging and cleaning the scanner EUV chamber and source. Hydrogen, nitrogen, argon and ultra-high purity compressed dry air (UHPCDA) are the most common gases utilized at the scanner and source level. Purity requirements are tighter than for previous technology node tools. In addition, specifically for hydrogen, EUV tool users are facing not only gas purity challenges but also the need for safe disposal of the hydrogen at the tool outlet. Recovery, reuse or recycling strategies could mitigate the disposal process and reduce the overall tool cost of operation. This paper will review the types of purification technologies that are currently available to generate high purity hydrogen suitable for EUV applications. Advantages and disadvantages of each purification technology will be presented. Guidelines on how to select the most appropriate technology for each application and experimental conditions will be presented. A discussion of the most common approaches utilized at the facility level to operate EUV tools along with possible hydrogen recovery strategies will also be reported.", "Measurement and control of line edge roughness (LER) is one of the most challenging issues facing patterning technology. As the critical dimensions (CD) of patterned structures decrease, LER of only a few nanometers can negatively impact device performance. Here, Mueller matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry (MMSE) based scatterometry is used to determine LER in periodic line-space structures in 28 nm pitch Si fin samples fabricated by directed selfassembly (DSA) patterning. The optical response of the Mueller matrix (MM) elements is influenced by structural parameters like pitch, CD, height, and side-wall angle (SWA), as well as the optical properties of the materials. Evaluation and decoupling MM element response to LER from other structural parameters requires sensitivity analysis using simulations of optical models that include LER. Here, an approach is developed that quantifies Si fin LER by comparing the optical responses generated by systematically varying the grating shape and measurement conditions. Finally, the validity of this approach is established by comparing the results obtained from top down scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and cross-sectional TEM image of the 28 nm pitch Si fins.", "The maximum amount of repulsive force applied to the surface plays a very important role in damage of tip or sample in Atomic Force Microscopy(AFM). So far, many investigations have focused on peak repulsive forces in tapping mode AFM in steady state conditions. However, it is known that AFM could be more damaging in transient conditions. In high-speed scanning, and in presence of 3D nano structures (such as FinFET), the changes in topography appear in time intervals shorter than the response time of the cantilever. In this case, the tip may crush into the sample by exerting much higher forces than for the same cantilever-sample distance in steady state situations. In this study the effects of steep upward steps in topography on the tip-sample interactions have been investigated, and it has been found that the order(s) of magnitude higher forces can be applied. The information on the worst case scenario obtained by this method can be used for selection of operation parameters and probe design to minimize damage in high-speed imaging. The numerically obtained results have been verified with the previous works in steady state regime. Based on this investigation the maximum safe scanning speed has been obtained for a case study.", "Electron beam induced surface damage in general, and resist shrinkage in particular, are serious issues in any form of electron beam based metrology. Previous studies investigated dimensional changes that occur in resists that were exposed to electron beams. This work builds on these previous studies to consider changes to the material properties of the exposed resists and other materials using quantitative nano-mechanical mapping scanning probe microscopy. Initial data has shown clearly that there are measurable material differences between pre- and post-electron beam exposure. To study this change iArF photo-resists are exposed to varying electron beam energies and doses. These regions are then measured via SPM for dimensional and material property changes. These changes in the exposed areas are correlated to those predicted by modeled results.", "We have synthesized a new resist molecule and investigated its high-resolution capability. The material showed resolved line-spaces with 14 nm half-pitch (hp) and the potential to pattern 11 nm hp features. Line edge roughness values as low as 3.15 nm were seen in optimized formulations. The dose-to-size is estimated at around 20-30 mJ/cm2. The role of the molecule in the patterning process was studied by comparing it with structurally similar compounds. Furthermore we present first results from exposures of our materials at the Berkeley Micro Exposure Tool. Finally it is also demonstrated that the material works as a resist in 100 kV electron beam lithography as well.", "This study describes the recent progress of negative-tone imaging with EUV exposure (EUV-NTI) compared with positive-tone development (PTD). NTI uses organic solvent-based developer to provide low swelling and smooth-dissolving behavior. Therefore, EUV-NTI is expected to offer several advantages in terms of performance, especially for improving line-width roughness (LWR), which is expected to resolve the resolution, LWR, and sensitivity (RLS) tradeoff. Herein, novel chemical amplified resist materials for EUV-NTI are investigated to improve LWR and sensitivity. Results indicate that the EUV-NTI has better performance than PTD, with \u2018single digit mJ/cm2,while maintaining the LWR performance. Furthermore, EUV-NTI processing such as the pre-applied bake (PAB) temperature, post-exposure bake (PEB) temperature, development procedure, and rinse procedure are very effective for improving the lithographic performance. In addition, the lithographic performance with NXE3100 scanner is also reported.", "This work focuses on the application of a high speed atomic force microscope for the in situ visualization / quantification of the pattern formation phenomenon during resist dissolution. Specifically, this paper discusses on the quantification of various factors (e.g. pattern roughness, defects, etc.) that affect pattern quality. Comparing two typical positive-tone, extreme-ultraviolet lithography resists of dissimilar lithographic performance, results show that the differences in LER between such resists already exists even during the resist dissolution. This implies the significance of the dissolution process in further improving the final LER of lines-and-spaces (L/S) patterns. Moreover, results have shown the effectiveness of applying the same analysis technique in understanding pattern defect dynamics during dissolution, not only for L/S but also for contact hole (CH) patterns. Preliminary investigations on CH pattern formation during dissolution showed position-dependent variabilities / randomness in the timing of CH formation. Such variabilities in timing imply possible pointers in defining the origin of missing CH defects, from the resist dissolution point-of-view.", "The main roadblock for EUV lithography to be successfully adopted for high-volume manufacturing is the current lack of source power. One way to help mitigate this problem is to optimize the photoresist by increasing both absorbance and quantum yield. The latter represents the ratio between the sums of generated acids and absorbed photons. Yield is also thought to be limited by the number of generated electrons per absorbed photon, or electron yield, that may be generated after a photo absorption event.\nWhile absorbance is relatively easy to measure, yields are extremely difficult to quantify, and the debate on upper limits is far from settled. In this paper, we present how, using synchrotron light with tunable energy, we directly measured dispersion curves and electron yield for ArF, KrF and EUV photoresists using X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy.\nKnowing the electron yield allowed us to better model organic EUV materials: stochastic simulations show how both electron yield and blur are very similar for organic materials, and how the electron blur is not a fixed property of the material, but may vary spatially, depending on a combination of photoresist formulation and local photon absorption density.", "It is desirable to simultaneously improve the resolution, line-edge roughness (LER), and sensitivity of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resist materials. In a resist film, nanometer-scale inhomogeneous structures may have significant direct effects on the resolution and LER along with indirect effects on sensitivity. This study will evaluate the inhomogeneity of photoacid generators (PAGs) in a hybrid-type EUV resist film using molecular-dynamics simulations. The results show the inhomogeneity of PAG positions and motions in the resist film. Moreover, PAG anions show larger diffusion coefficients than PAG cations. These results can be elucidated in terms of the free volumes in the resist matrix and the molecular structures of PAG, such as the bulky phenyl groups of PAG cations and the fluorine-atom interactions in PAG anions.", "Two approaches which achieve the further evolution of NTD (Negative Tone Development) process are shown in this article. One is ACCEL (Advanced Chemical Contrast Enhancement Layer) process that can improve the lithography performance and the other is DTD (Dual Tone Development) process that can shrink patterning pitch below the limit of single exposure process. ACCEL is an additionally provided layer which is coated on a surface of NTD resist film before exposure and removed by NTD developer. ACCEL can enhance the acid distribution and dissolution contrast of the NTD resist. In fact, lithography performances such as exposure latitude (EL) and DOF improved dramatically by applying ACCEL compared to the NTD resist without ACCEL. We consider that suppression of excessive acid diffusion and material transfer between the resist layer and the ACCEL layer are the causes of the contrast enhancement. DTD process is one of the simplest pitch shrink method which is achieved by repeating PTD and NTD process. Feasibility study of DTD patterning has been demonstrated so far. However, Exposure latitude margin and CDU performance were not sufficient for applying DTD to HVM. We developed the novel DTD specific resist under a new concept, and 32 nm half pitch (hp) contact hole (CH) pattern was successfully formed with enough margins. DTD line and space (L/S) patterning are also demonstrated and 24 nm hp L/S pattern can be resolved. k1 factors of DTD CH and L/S patterns reach to 0.20 and 0.15, respectively.", "Many different types of non-traditional resist designs have shown promise for future generations of patterning, but there is a greater need for understanding and developing additives and ancillary materials for these novel resists compared to traditional polymeric positive tone systems which are quite mature. With the goal of meeting some of these needs, we carried out multiple different studies of negative tone molecular resists based on epoxide cross-linking. We have developed methods for controlling cross-linking in these materials using photo-decomposable nucleophiles (PDNs) which have shown resolution improvements in one resist from 26 nm down to 18 nm so far. Aqueous base developed systems have been made by introducing phenol groups to these resists. Although the first molecule designed successfully patterns in aqueous base, its performance is limited compared to organic solvent development. A series of di-functional epoxide molecular resists have been made and generally show much worse sensitivity than a fourfunctional epoxide resist. Underlayers (ULs) have been designed specifically to leverage the high reactivity of epoxides to create ULs that can cross-link to the resist. These ULs improve the adhesion of some of these molecular resists, but also show significant sensitivity improvements compared to imaging on bare silicon. Sensitivity in one resist was improved by 5-12 mJ/cm2 simply by using the UL.", "Immersion based 20nm technology node and below becoming very challenging to chip designers, process and integration due to multiple patterning to integrate one design layer . Negative tone development (NTD) processes have been well accepted by industry experts for enabling technologies 20 nm and below. 193i double patterning is the technology solution for pitch down to 80 nm. This imposes tight control in critical dimension(CD) variation in double patterning where design patterns are decomposed in two different masks such as in litho-etch-litho etch (LELE). CD bimodality has been widely studied in LELE double patterning. A portion of CD tolerance budget is significantly consumed by variations in CD in double patterning.\nThe objective of this work is to study the process variation challenges and resolution in the Negative Tone Develop Process for 20 nm and Below Technology Node. This paper describes the effect of dose slope on CD variation in negative tone develop LELE process. This effect becomes even more challenging with standalone NTD developer process due to q-time driven CD variation. We studied impact of different stacks with combination of binary and attenuated phase shift mask and estimated dose slope contribution individually from stack and mask type. Mask 3D simulation was carried out to understand theoretical aspect. In order to meet the minimum insulator requirement for the worst case on wafer the overlay and critical dimension uniformity (CDU) budget margins have slimmed. Besides the litho process and tool control using enhanced metrology feedback, the variation control has other dependencies too. Color balancing between the two masks in LELE is helpful in countering effects such as iso-dense bias, and pattern shifting. Dummy insertion and the improved decomposition techniques [2] using multiple lower priority constraints can help to a great extent. Innovative color aware routing techniques [3] can also help with achieving more uniform density and color balanced layouts.", "A series of five negative tone epoxide functionalized molecular resists have been synthesized and have had their glass transition temperature (Tg) and lithographic contrast behavior characterized. Introducing rigid structural features in the form of aromatic rings to a resist was found to increase its glass transition temperature. All resists but one, BHPF-2Ep, were found to have poor film stability which required the use of an underlayer. A trend was observed where PEB conditions performed at temperatures much higher than the Tg of the molecular resist was found to induce propagation of polymerization outside of exposed regions. Di-functionalized resists were observed to have poor sensitivity due to their low degree of functionalization. A resist was synthesized (BHPF-2Ep) which was capable of resolving features down to 20 nm with an imaging dose of 70.5 mJ/cm2.", "Through the continuous scaling with extension of 193-immersion lithography, the multi-patterning process with the grid-based design has become nominal process for fine fabrication to relax tight pitch designs[1]. In self-aligned type multiple patterning, 7 nm node gate pattern was reported[2],[3] and it was become a focal point LER on core-pattern is essential category to control pattern placement variations. Though CD uniformity (CDU) on line pattern in self-aligned double patterning (SADP) is relatively stable caused in high thickness controllability of spacer deposition films, the variations of CDU and LER on first core pattern impinge the CDU on space and pitch pattern. In previous study, pattern fidelity of single exposure patterning was improved through photoresist smoothing process using direct-current superposition technique[4],[5].\nIn this paper, we will report that photoresist smoothing work in an efficient way to pattern fidelity control in self-aligned type multiple patterning.", "In the presented work solvent-free film preparation from tailored molecular glass resists, their thermal analysis, the characterization of etch resistance for plasma etching transfer processes, and the evaluation of the patterning performance using scanning probe lithography (SPL) tools, in particular electric field and thermal based SPL, are demonstrated. Therefore a series of fully aromatic spiro-based and tris-substituted twisted resist materials were systematically investigated. The materials feature very high glass transition temperatures of up to 173 \u00b0C, which allows solvent-free thin film preparation by physical vapor deposition (PVD) due to their high thermal stability. The PVD prepared films offer distinct advantages compared to spin coated films such as no pinholes, defects, or residual solvent domains, which can locally affect the film properties. In addition, PVD prepared films do not need a post apply bake (PAB) and can be precisely prepared in the nanometer range layer thickness. An observed sufficient plasma etching resistance is promising for an efficient pattern transfer even by utilizing only 10 nm thin resist films. Their lithographic resolution potential is demonstrated by a positive and a negative tone patterning using electric field, current controlled scanning probe lithography (EF-CC-SPL) at the Technical University of Ilmenau or thermal scanning probe lithography (tSPL) investigations at the IBM Research - Zurich. High resolution tSPL prepared patterns of 11 nm half pitch and at 4 nm patterning depth are demonstrated.", "In order to improve line width roughness (LWR) of chemically amplified resists (CARs) without trade-offs with other lithographic performances such as exposure latitude (EL) and sensitivity, we investigated effects of the spatial fluctuation of sensitivity on LWR of ArF resists. Compared a statistical model with experiments, it was clarified that LWR of ArF resists was caused by the fluctuation of sensitivity due to the fluctuation of the PAG and quencher concentration. Furthermore, we developed novel photoactive materials such as a transparent PAG and an nPAG-1Amine which were predicted to be useful for reducing the statistical fluctuation of sensitivity by the theoretical model. LWR was successfully improved using these photoactive materials. This study not only provided new insight into the root cause of LWR, but also proved efficacy of the theory-based material design.", "Spin coating has been used as a photoresist application method for many years, and consequently certain defects have been recognized through each resist generation; i-line, KrF, ArF, ArF immersion and, most recently, EUV. Last year we reported an in-situ analysis via high-speed video camera that proved to be useful for understanding defect formation such as non-uniformity spots within organic film coatings and post-develop water-mark defects. In this study, fingerprints known as \u2018tiger stripes\u2019 around the wafer\u2019s edge were analyzed. This phenomenon, for example, is directly related to the wafer spin-speed and air-flow during the coat-processing. Utilizing a high-speed camera and 3D simulation, we reveal the mechanism of fingerprint generation for tiger stripe phenomena, confirm the mechanism with several different spin-speeds, and correlate these to defect inspection results. Furthermore, we will discuss the expansion to 450mmm wafers.", "One of the key challenges to high resolution resist patterning is probing the resist properties at length scales commensurate with the pattern size. Using a new scanning probe microscopy (SPM), Peak Force\u2122 tapping, we map exposure dependent nanoscale modulus of the exposed/developed resist patterns with sub-10 nm resolution. By innovative electron beam exposure pattern design, the SPM technique reveals that resist modulus follows the height contrast profile, but with a shift to higher exposure doses. SEM image analysis of patterned resist structures confirm that the best line-space patterns are achieved at exposure dose where modulus reaches its maximum and shows how modulus can be used to probe patternability of resist systems.", "Lack of progress in reducing linewidth roughness of lithographic features has led to investigations of the use of post-lithography process smoothing techniques. But it remains unclear whether such postprocessing will sufficiently reduce the detrimental effects of feature roughness. Thus, there is a need to understand the efficacy of post-processing on not just roughness reduction, but on the negative device impacts of roughness. This work derives model equations of how roughness impacts lithographic performance, and incorporates smoothing using post-processing. These models clearly show that post-process smoothing works best by increasing the correlation length. Increasing the correlation length is very effective at reducing high-frequency roughness that impacts within-feature variations, but is not very effective at reducing low-frequency roughness that impacts feature-tofeature variations. It seems that post-process smoothing is not a substitute for reducing the initial roughness of resist features.", "Contact Hole (CH) Local Critical Dimension Uniformity (LCDU) has a direct impact on device performance. As a consequence, being able to understand and quantifying the different LCDU contributors and the way they evolve during the various process steps is critical. In this work the impact of etch process on LCDU for different resists and stacks is investigated on ASML NXE:3100 and NXE:3300. LCDU is decomposed into shot noise, mask, and metrology components. The design of the experiment is optimized to minimize the decomposition error. CD and LCDU are monitored and found to be stable.\nWe observed that the net effect of the etch process is to improve LCDU, although the final LCDU is both stack- and resist-dependent. Different resists demonstrate the same LCDU improvement, so that the LCDU after etch will depend on the initial resist performance. Using a stack different from the one used to set up the etch process can undermine the LCDU improvement.\nThe impact of the various etch steps is investigated in order to identify the physical mechanisms responsible for the LCDU improvement through etch. Both top-down and cross section Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are used. The step-by-step analysis of the etch process showed that the main LCDU improvement is achieved during oxide etch, while the other process steps are either ineffective or detrimental in terms of LCDU. The main cause of the LCDU improvement is then attributed to the polymerization of the CH surface happening during the oxide etch.\nFinally, the LCDU improvement caused by the etch process is investigated as a function of the initial LCDU after litho in a relatively broad range (2-15nm). The ratio between LCDU after litho over LCDU after etch is investigated as a function of the initial LCDU after litho for two different resists. The results indicate that the impact of etch on LCDU is characterized by a single curve, specific to the etch process in use and independent of the resist type. In addition, we observe that the percentage LCDU improvement is constant above a certain threshold, in agreement with the throughpitch results.", "We have developed a series of fullerene containing materials for use as organic hard masks. Films with a thickness of up to 250 nm were deposited via spin coating. After a crosslinking bake the films exhibit good thermal stability \u2013 in the best case a mass loss of less than 3% at 400 \u00b0C is seen. Etch resistance of the different formulations are presented and hig-hresolution patterning is demonstrated. During the transfer into silicon no adverse \u201cwiggling\u201d is observed at high resolution. We attribute this to the low levels of aliphatic hydrogen present in the materials.", "Numerous block copolymer (BCP) systems can be used in directed self-assembly (DSA) processes to form patterns useful in lithography, especially lines and spaces with lamellar phase systems and vias/pillars with cylindrical phase systems. However, most of these BCP systems with attractive pattern formation capabilities have limited plasma etch contrast between the polymer domains. One potential solution to greatly enhance this etch contrast is a recently developed technique called sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS). SIS is a self-limiting synthesis technique, like atomic layer deposition, where organometallic (OM) precursor vapours and oxidants are introduced into self-assembled block copolymer systems in multiple cycles. In the first half of each cycle the OM precursor selectively reacts with one polymer domain, and in the second half of the cycle the oxidant reacts with the OM groups in the polymer film to selectively form metallic compounds in one of the polymer domains. Thus, the polymer pattern is transformed into a metallic mask with much enhanced plasma etch contrast. We report the effects of such a block-selective SIS process of metallic compounds on the feature sizes, roughness and profiles of patterns formed with BCP systems.", "The self-assembling behavior of thermally annealed PS-b-PMMA block copolymer derivatives (GEN2 BCPs) was evaluated using a substrate modified by a random copolymer, commonly called a \u2018brush\u2019. Similar to PS-b-PMMA, surface modification using the random copolymer brush served as an effective technique for controlling the domain orientation of the GEN2 BCP and yielded aligned features with pitches below 24nm. Non-preferential and weakly preferential random copolymers were also defined and applied to DSA using a graphoepitaxial approach. Finally, a Dry Development Rinse Process (DDRP)[1] was tested as a method to prevent pattern collapse and improve pattern transfer for GEN2 BCPs.", "To extend scaling beyond poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) for directed self-assembly (DSA), high quality organic high-x block copolymers (HC series) were developed and applied to implementation of sub-10 nm L/S DSA. Lamellae-forming block copolymers (BCPs) of the HC series showed the ability to form vertically oriented polymer domains conveniently with the in-house PS-r-PMMA underlayers (AZEMBLY EXP NLD series) without the use of an additional topcoat. The orientation control was achieved with low bake temperatures (\u2264200 \u00b0C) and short bake times (\u22645 min). Also, these process-friendly materials are compatible with existing 193i-based graphoepitaxy and chemoepitaxy DSA schemes. In addition, it is notable that 8.5 nm organic lamellae domains were amenable to pattern development by simple dry etch techniques. These successful demonstrations of high-x L/S DSA on 193i-defined guiding patterns and pattern development can offer a feasible route to access sub-10 nm node patterning technology.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) is being extensively evaluated for application in semiconductor process integration.1-7 Since 2011, the number of publications on DSA at SPIE has exploded from roughly 26 to well over 80, indicating the groundswell of interest in the technology. Driving this interest are a number of attractive aspects of DSA including the ability to form both line/space and hole patterns at dimensions below 15 nm, the ability to achieve pitch multiplication to extend optical lithography, and the relatively low cost of the processes when compared with EUV or multiple patterning options.\nTokyo Electron Limited has focused its efforts in scaling many laboratory demonstrations to 300 mm wafers. Additionally, we have recognized that the use of DSA requires specific design considerations to create robust layouts. To this end, we have discussed the development of a DSA ecosystem that will make DSA a viable technology for our industry, and we have partnered with numerous companies to aid in the development of the ecosystem. This presentation will focus on our continuing role in developing the equipment required for DSA implementation specifically discussing defectivity reduction on flows for making line-space and hole patterns, etch transfer of DSA patterns into substrates of interest, and integration of DSA processes into larger patterning schemes.", "Directed Self Assembly (DSA) processes offer the promise of providing alternative ways to extend optical lithography cost-effectively for sub-10nm nodes and present itself as an alternative pitch division approach. As a result, DSA has gained increased momentum in recent years, as a means for extending optical lithography past its current limits. The availability of a DSA processing line can enable to further push the limits of 193nm immersion lithography and overcome some of the critical concerns for EUV lithography.", "Inpria is developing directly patternable, metal oxide hardmasks as robust, high-resolution photoresists for EUV lithography. Targeted formulations have achieved 13nm half-pitch at 35 mJ/cm2 on an ASML\u2019s NXE:3300B scanner. Inpria\u2019s second-generation materials have an absorbance of 20/\u03bcm, thereby enabling an equivalent photon shot noise compared to conventional resists at a dose lower by a factor of 4X. These photoresists have ~40:1 etch selectivity into a typical carbon underlayer, so ultrathin 20nm films are possible, mitigating pattern collapse. In addition to lithographic performance, we review progress in parallel advances required to enable the transition from lab to fab for such a metal oxide photoresist. This includes considerations and data related to: solvent compatibility, metals cross-contamination, coat uniformity, stability, outgassing, and rework.", "We have developed organometallic carboxylate compounds [RnM(O2CR\u2019)2] capable of acting as negativetone EUV resists. Overall, the best and fastest resists contain antimony, are pentavalent and the carboxylate group contains a polymerizable olefin (e.g. acrylate, methacrylate or styrenecarboxylate). Evidence suggests that high sensitivity is achieved through the polymerization of olefins in the exposed region. We have performed a systematic sensitivity study of molecules of the type RnM(O2CR\u2019)2 where we have studied seven R groups, four main group metals (M), and three polymerizable carboxylate groups (O2CR\u2019). We found that the greatest predictor of sensitivity of the RnSb(O2CR\u2019)2 resists is their level of polymerizable olefins. We mathematically define the polymerizable olefin loading (POL) as the ratio of the number of olefins vs. the number of non-hydrogen atoms. Linear and log plots of Emax vs. POL for a variety of molecules of the type R3Sb(O2CR\u2019)2 lend insight into the behaviour of these resists.", "Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) Lithography is being thought to be one of the most promising candidate technologies to replace current optical lithography for the high-volume manufacturing of semiconductor devices at the 10 nm node and below. Through-put still seems to be under the target, so EUV resist materials are strongly required high resolution (R) with high sensitivity (S) and low line edge/width roughness (L). However, the chemically amplified resists should overcome RLS-trade-off. We focused on the development of EUV resist by the combination of the low activation energy protecting group (PG) and high quantum yield PAG for overcoming RLS trade-off.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) is attracting a growing amount of interest as a technique to expand traditional lithography beyond its current limits. It has recently been demonstrated that chemoepitaxy can be used to successfully direct BCP assembly to form large arrays of high-density features using the \u2018LiNe\u2019 flow. This process uses lithography and trim-etch to produce a \u201cprepattern\u201d of stripes of alternating chemical composition, which in turn guide the formation of assembled BCP structures. The entire process is predicated on the preferential interaction of the respective BCP domains with particular regions of the underlying prepattern. The natural and relative strength of these interactions are at least partially responsible for many aspects of the resulting assembled BCP film, including equilibrium morphology, type and persistence of kinetically trapped defects, and domain roughness. This study develops the understanding of how various guiding chemistries ultimately govern BCP morphology and characteristics in the LiNe flow. In particular, the work focuses on how stronger affinity between chemical patterns and the guided BCP film leads to faster assembly, lower ultimate defectivity levels, and better incommensurability tolerance, as well as the relationship between pattern strength and domain roughness. One issue in generating finely controllable chemical patterns is that all materials are affected to some degree by processing, which can modify or weaken the guiding ability of the pattern. This investigation addresses the non-idealities introduced in production processing and explores how this knowledge can be employed in improving BCP DSA for lithography.", "The patterning potential of block copolymer (BCP) materials via various directed self-assembly (DSA) schemes has been demonstrated for over a decade. We have previously reported the HONEYCOMB flow; a process flow where we utilize Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography and Oxygen plasma to guide the assembly of cylindrical phase BCPs into regular hexagonal arrays of contact holes [1, 2]. In this work we report the development of a new process flow, the CHIPS flow, where we use ArFi lithography to print guiding patterns for the chemo-epitaxial DSA of BCPs. Using this process flow we demonstrate BCP assembly into hexagonal arrays with sub-25 nm half-pitch and discuss critical steps of the process flow. Additionally, we discuss the influence of under-layer surface energy on the DSA process window and report contact hole metrology results.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) is one of the leading candidates for next generation patterning in IC manufacturing. With the continued delay of EUV and the increasing costs of evermore complex multipatterning techniques, DSA has the potential to produce small, well-defined features on a tight pitch. The graphoepitaxy DSA approach can be used to form single or multiple uniform contact holes (cylinders) well below the resolution limit of the optical exposure tool in a pre-pattern template. The utility of these patterns in the semiconductor manufacturing process is dependent on the capability of the process to control the size, edge roughness and placement of these DSA structures in the presence of reasonable levels of variation in the DSA material, the processing of that material and the pre-pattern template. In this study, a 3-D Self-Consistent Field Theory (SCFT) model has been developed to describe the behavior of such DSA systems. The utility of the simulator to describe actual physical behavior is explored, by fine tuning the SCFT model input parameters against experimental data for certain pre-pattern configurations and then evaluating the model predictions for other separate pre-pattern shapes. Two separate calibration studies are presented, one with 2-D guide patterns, in which multiple holes are positioned in a 2-D irregular array, and the other with 1-D structures, where the holes are distributed along one direction only. Pattern contours are extracted from CD-SEM images. A metric that measures the CD and placement is used to evaluate the modeled contours against the experimental contours.", "While directed self-assembly based on poly(styrene)-block-poly(methylmethacrylate) block copolymers (BCP) for contact shrink or multiplication applications approaches industrial maturity, new systems with the ability to self-assemble with sub-20 nm features need to be evaluated taking into account the integration requirements (in terms of solvent, thermal budget, etching capability,\u2026). In this contribution, two different systems Si-containing BCP systems will be presented targeting line/space applications. These two systems are characterized by a high segregation strength allowing the design of block copolymers with sub-20 nm period while high etching contrast inherent to the Si-containing block could be achieved between the different blocks. Firstly original poly(dimethylsilacyclobutane)-blockpoly( methylmethacrylate) (PDMSB-b-PMMA) block copolymers showing hexagonal arrays of PDMBS cylinders have been developed. Study of the PDMSB-b-PMMA self-assembly both on free surface and on patterned substrates show its high potential since long range order arrays can be obtained by a rapid thermal annealing treatment. Besides preliminary results on their track integration is discussed with a demonstration of density multiplication up to 18. The second system consists of poly(dimethylsiloxane)-block-poly(lactid acid) block chains which self-assemble into PDMS cylinders in thin film configuration. Such block copolymer system provides an easy access to line/space arrays of parallel PDMS cylinders which can be subsequently transferred into the desired stack layers through plasma etching.", "Recently, directed self-assembly (DSA) method is focused on as a next generation lithography technique. We performed the DPD simulations to analyze the self-assembling process of block copolymer in DSA using OCTA (in detail, see http://octa.jp) system. Using DPD simulation, we can obtain the phase separated structures at each moment consisted by block copolymer chains. As those structures are consisted by polymer chains, an analysis can be done on those structures. In this paper, we study the dynamics of end particles in the defect annihilation process to understand the dynamics of self-assembling of block copolymer in DSA. From our analysis, the end particles moves in advance than the change of domain structure in the defect annihilation process.", "Since the pattern pitch is getting smaller and smaller, the pattern collapse issue has been getting sever problem in the lithography process. Pattern collapse is one of the main reasons for minimizing of process margin at fine pitch by ArF-immersion or EUV lithography. The possible major cause of pattern collapse is the surface tension of the rinsing liquid and the shrinkage of resist pattern\u2019s surface. These surface tension or shrinkage are occurred in the spin drying process of the rinsing liquid. The influence of surface tension against very small pitch pattern is particularly severe. One of the most effective solution for this problem is thinning of the resist film thickness, however this strategy is reaching to its limits in terms of substrate etching process anymore. Recently the tri-layer resist process or hard mask processes have been used, but there is a limit to the thinning of resist film and there is no essential solution for this problem. On the other hand, dry development process such a supercritical drying method or DSA patterning by dry etching have been known as an ultimate way to suppress the pattern collapse issue. However, these processes are not applied to the mass production process right now because these have some problems such a defect issue, requirement of the special equipment and so on. We newly developed the novel process and material which can prevent the pattern collapse issue perfectly without using any special equipment. The process is Dry Development Rinse process (DDR process), and the material used in the process is Dry Development Rinse material (DDR material). DDR material is containing the special polymer which can replace the exposed and developed part. And finally, the resist pattern is developed by dry etching process without any pattern collapse issue. In this paper, we will discuss the approach for preventing the pattern collapse issue in ArF and EUV lithography process, and propose DDR process and DDR material as the solution.", "This paper presents a heuristic model for scanning helium ion beam lithography (SHIBL) in a EUV chemically amplified resist. The model employs a point-spread function to account for all physical and chemical phenomena involved in the resist activation. Ion shot noise effects are accounted for using Poisson statistics. Our model shows a good agreement with earlier single-pixel SHIBL experiments for determining line width as a function of dose for a desired line-and-space pattern. Furthermore, we propose optimized-pixel-dose SHIBL to improve exposure latitude, LCDU and LWR. Dose optimization is advantageous to single-pixel exposure when the feature size is at least about twice the width of the FWHM of the point-spread function. We confirm this by comparing our modeling results for single-pixel and optimizedpixel- dose exposure modes for line-and-space patterns", "Self-aligned multiple patterning technique has enabled the further down scaling through 193 immersion lithography extension [1-5]. In particular, focus on the logic device scaling, we have finished the verification of patterning technology of up to 10nm node [6-7], we will discuss about some patterning technologies that are required to 7nm node. For critical layers in FinFET devices that presume a 1D cell design, there is also a need not just for the scaling of grating patterns but also for pattern cutting process. In 7nm node, cutting number increase in metal or fin layer, and also pattern splitting of contact or via is complicated, so both cost reduction and process controllability including EPE are strongly required. For example, inverse hardmask scheme in metal layer can improve CD variation of the Cu wiring. Furthermore hole pattern shrink technology in contact layer, by the combination with the exposure technique which has k1 0.25 or less, can achieve both cost reduction and reducing the numbers of pitch splitting. This paper presents the possibility of immersion-based multiple patterning techniques for up to 7nm node.", "Pattern collapse currently limits the achievable resolution of the highest resolving EUV photoresists available. The causes of pattern collapse include the surface tension of the rinse liquid and the shrinkage of the resist pattern during the drying step. If these collapse mechanisms can be successfully mitigated with process approaches that do not require changes to the resist itself, the ultimate resolution of existing EUV resists can be improved. Described here is a dry development rinse process, applicable to existing EUV photoresists, which prevents pattern collapse to both improve ultimate resolution and the process window of currently resolvable features. Reducing the burden of collapse prevention on the resist also allows improvements in line width roughness (LWR) and cross section profile and provides additional degrees of freedom for future resist design.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) of Block Co-Polymer (BCP) with conventional lithography is being thought as one of the potential patterning solution for future generation devices manufacturing. Many studies have been reported to fabricate the aligned patterns both on grapho and chemoepitaxy for semiconductor application1, 2. The hole shrink and multiplication by graphoepitaxy are one of the DSA implementation candidates in terms of relatively realistic process and versatility of chip design. The critical challenges on hole shrink and multiplication by using conventional Poly (styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) BCP have been reported such as CD uniformity, placement error3 and defectivity. It is needed to overcome these challenging issues by improving not only whole process but materials. From the material aspect, the surface treatment material for guide structure, and process friendly BCP material are key development items on graphoepitaxy. In this paper, it will be shown in BCP approach about conventional PS-b-PMMA with additives and new casting solvent as PS-b-PMMA extension for CD uniformity and placement error improvement and then it\u2019ll be discussed on what is the key factor and solution from BCP material approach.", "It is well known that metal oxide films are useful as hard mask material in semiconductor industry for their excellent etch resistance against plasma etches. In the advanced lithography processes, in addition to good etch resistance, they also need to possess good wet removability, fill capability, in high aspect ratio contacts or trenches. Conventional metal containing materials can be applied by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD). Films derived from these techniques have difficulty in controlling wet etch, have low throughput and need special equipment. This leads to high costs. Therefore it is desirable to develop simple spin-on coating materials to generate metal oxide hard masks that have good trench or via filling performances using spin track friendly processing conditions. In this report, novel spin-on type inorganic formulations providing Ti, W, Hf and Zr oxide hard masks will be described. The new materials have demonstrated high etch selectivity, good filling performances, wet removal capability, low trace metals and good shelf-life stability. These novel AZ\u00ae Spin-on metal hard mask formulations can be used in several new applications and can potentially replace any metal, metal oxide, metal nitride or silicon-containing hard mask films currently deposited using CVD process in the semiconductor manufacturing process.", "Cleaning processes account for over 25% of processing in microelectronic manufacturing [1], suggesting electronics to be one of the most chemical intensive markets in commerce. Industry roadmaps exist to reduce chemical exposure, usage, and waste [2]. Companies are encouraged to create a safer working environment, or green factory, and ultimately become certified similar to LEED in the building industry [3]. A significant step in this direction is the integration of aqueous-based photoresist (PR) strippers which eliminate regulatory risks and cut costs by over 50%. One of the largest organic solvent usages is based upon thick PR removal during bumping processes [4-6]. Using market projections and the benefits of recycling, it is estimated that over 1,000 metric tons (mt) of residuals originating from bumping processes are incinerated or sent to a landfill. Aqueous-based stripping would eliminate this disposal while also reducing the daily risks to workers and added permitting costs. Positive-tone PR dissolves in aqueous strippers while negative-tone systems are lifted-off from the substrate, bumps, pillars, and redistribution layers (RDL). While the wafers are further processed and rinsed, the lifted-off PR is pumped from the tank, collected onto a filter, and periodically back-flushed to the trash. The PR solids become a non-hazardous plastic waste while the liquids are mixed with the developer stream, neutralized, filtered, and in most cases, disposed to the sewer. Regardless of PR thickness, removal processes may be tuned to perform in <15min, performing at rates nearly 10X faster than solvents with higher bath lives. A balanced formula is safe for metals, dielectrics, and may be customized to any fab.", "Inpria is pioneering a novel approach to EUV photoresist. Directly patternable metal oxide thin films have shown resolution better than 10nm half-pitch, with robust etch resistance, and efficient use of photons through high EUV absorbance. Inpria\u2019s Gen2 photoresists are cast from commonly used organic coating solvents and are developed in typical negative tone develop (NTD) organic solvents. This renders them compatible with CLEAN TRACK LITHIUS Pro-EUV coater/developer system (Tokyo Electron Limited; TEL) and solvent drains. The presence of metal in the photoresist demands additional scrutiny and process development to minimize contamination risks to other tools and wafers. In this paper, we review progress in developing coat processes that reduce metal contamination levels below typical industry levels. We demonstrate minimization of trace metals contamination from wafer-to-coater/developer, and wafer-to-wafer from the spin coat process. This will also include results from surface analyses of frontside edge exclusion and backside of wafer using best-known analytical methods. In addition, we discuss results of coat uniformity and defectivity optimization. Wet clean compatibility and dry etch rate by using conventional Si-ARC/OPL etching recipe will also be presented. In conjunction with this work, we identify potential contamination pathways and means for managing contamination risk. We furthermore review equipment compatibility issues for using Inpria\u2019s metal oxide photoresists.", "A photosensitive polyimide system based on amine catalyzed imidization of a precursor poly(amic ester) is described. The material is based on the meta ethyl ester of pyromellitic dianhydride and 2,2\u2019 bis(trifluoromethyl)benzidine and acts as a negative tone resist when formulated with a photobase generator. The material exhibits a dielectric constant of 3.0 in the GHz range, a coefficient of thermal expansion of 6\u00b12 ppm/K, and can be patterned to aspect ratios of greater than 2 when formulated with a high efficiency cinnamide type photobase generator.", "This work focuses on the investigation of dual tone patterning mechanism with hybrid inorganic/organic photoresists. Hafnium oxide (HfO2) modified with acrylic acid was prepared and the influence of electrolyte solutions as well as pH on its particle size change was investigated. The average particle size and zeta potential of the nanoparticles in different electrolyte solutions were measured. The results show that addition of different concentrations of electrolytes changed the hydrodynamic diameter of nanoparticles in water. Increased concentration of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) caused the zeta potential of nanoparticles to change from positive to negative and its hydrodynamic diameter to increase from 40 nm to 165 nm. In addition, increasing concentration of triflic acid led to the decrease of particle size and zeta potential.", "The role of photoresist has become more important for down scaling of electric devises. One of the key factors which identify the photoresist is a diffusion of acid through the lithography process. The \u2018top coat method\u2019 was proposed for measuring the distance of diffusion of acid which was generated from PAG and calculating the diffusion coefficient1-3. In this method, top coat material containing PAG (2nd layer) is coated on a PAG-free resist (1st layer), then the exposure and PEB processes are performed. The generated acid in 2nd layer during the exposure diffuses into 1st layer when the PEB is performed. After that, we can obtain the acid diffusion length based on the quantity of film removed by the development. In this work, we applied TOF-SIMS measurement with gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) etching to the samples that were prepared for top coat method. This measurement has revealed the distribution of diffusing PAG and residual protecting groups of the resin in the resist (1st layer). The diffusion length of the acid which is obtained by the top coat method has corresponded to the depth profile of the acid and the deprotection rate which is acquired by TOFSIMS with GCIB. We can estimate the marginal deprotection rate which is needed for the development by the result of these two methods. It has also been clear that the distributions of acid shifted into the resist according to the PEB temperature.", "The relation between resist composition and its development behavior was evaluated. The effect of a hydrophobic unit on a resist and on its development behavior was systematically investigated. The resist was exposed to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) or electron beam (EB) exposure, and the development behavior of the film was observed by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). The introduction of a hydrophobic group in the resist resulted in diminished swelling behavior and uniform dissolution. The resist resin cluster shape was also altered by the introduction of the hydrophobic group. These behaviors imply that the resin\u2013resin and resin\u2013tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution interactions differ. EUV lithography suffers from the photon issue that causes stochastic uniformity; however, in this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving a better uniformity of resist patterning by altering the resist formulation.", "Negative tone development (NTD) has dramatically gained popularity in 193 nm dry and immersion lithography, due to their superior imaging performance [1, 2 and 3].\nPopular negative tone developers are organic solvents such as n- butyl acetate (n-BA), aliphatic ketones, or high-density alcohols such as Methyl Isobutyl Carbinol (MIBC). In this work, a comparative study between ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UPE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) POU filtration for n-BA based NTD has been carried out.\nResults correlate with the occurrence or the mitigation of micro bridges in a 45 nm dense line pattern created through immersion lithography as a function of POU membrane.", "In this paper, we report the development of new xanthendiol derivatives applied to the negative-tone molecular resists for EB/EUVL. The new xanthendiol derivatives were easily synthesized by the condensation of aldehydes and dihydroxyaromatic compounds. We found 13,13\u2019-biphenyl-bis(13H-benzoxanthen-2,11-diol) was showed the good applicability to the raw material for the resist for EB/EUVL. The EB patterning result showed the resist containing xanthendiol derivative could resolve the 20 nm half-pitch pattern, and 15 nm half-pitch patterns were partially resolved.", "A newly light-scattering thermal cross-linking material based on self-assembly for forming the morphology of nanoparticle free polymer blends was reported. The material design concept to use light-scattering thermal cross-linking material with high uniformity of light on display panel from LED for high quality such as brightness and evenness, mechanical properties, and gas and water barrier properties. The high light scattering rate of 8 % at 350-450 nm of wavelength, fast cure film at 140 \u00baC and 120 s, and thermal stability at 190 \u00baC in bake condition for high productivity were indicated in the light-scattering thermal cross-linking material using the nanoparticle free polymers with carboxylic acid functional groups. These novel system using morphology of nanoparticle free polymer blends in light-scattering package material for a LCD using LED was a valuable approach to the design of material formulations for newly light-scattering thermal cross-linking material.", "Various blends approaches based on PS-b-PMMA block-copolymers (BCP) systems are studied. The impacts of the different components in the blends on various basic characteristics of interest for lithographic applications are highlighted. More specifically, we show how such approaches can be managed to get a tight control over the different dimensions of the self-assembly, and reach lower defects levels than a single pure BCP. These methods could greatly help the BCP self-assembly technology to be introduced as an actual lithographic technic to further reduce achievable dimensions.", "We investigated the eco-friendly electron beam (EB) and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography using a high-sensitive negative type of green resist material derived from biomass to take advantage of organic solvent-free water spin-coating and tetramethylammonium hydroxide(TMAH)-free water-developable techniques. A water developable, non-chemically amplified, high sensitive, and negative tone resist material in EB lithography was developed for environmental affair, safety, easiness of handling, and health of the working people, instead of the common developable process of TMAH. The material design concept to use the water-soluble resist material with acceptable properties such as pillar patterns with less than 100 nm in high EB sensitivity of 10 \u03bcC/cm2 and etch selectivity with a silicon-based middle layer in CF4 plasma treatment was demonstrated for EB and EUV lithography.", "New \u201cself-immolating\u201d or \u201cunzipping\u201d polymers, materials that depolymerize in response to irradiation, were designed and prepared successfully. We studied several candidate polymers and ultimately chose two of them for further development. One is a polyester that aromatizes upon depolymerization. The unzipping reaction initiated by UV exposure in solution was confirmed. The polymer was then studied in thin films to assess its potential for use in formulating photoresists. The neat polymer was tested as a blend with novolac resin. The effect of unzipping polyester loading in novolac on the rate of dissolution of films in TMAH was studied. Inhibition occurs at 20\u221230% loading. The films were exposed with DUV light and patterning was observed. The sensitivity of the unzipping polyester formulation is low in part due to the low absorption of the polymer for UV light. However, the polymer showed higher sensitivity with EUV exposure and first contrast curves show sensitivity in the range of 20\u221225mJ/cm2.", "EUV lithography is the most favorable process for high volume manufacturing of semiconductor devices beyond 1X nm half-pitch at present. Many efforts have revealed effective proton sources in acid generation in EUV resists, and the effective proton generation and the control of the generated acid diffusion are required to improve the breakthrough of the resolution \uff0d line width roughness \uff0d sensitivity(RLS) trade-off. To clarify the lithographic performance of these derivatives, we synthesized the acrylic ter/tetrapolymers containing novel lactone derivatives - LCHO and LAATB - as model photopolymers and exposed the resist samples based on these polymers to EUV and EB radiation. On the basis of the lithographic performances of these photoresists, we evaluated the characteristics of lactone derivatives upon exposure to EUV radiation. We discuss the relationship between the chemical structures of these derivatives and lithographic performance.", "A negative tone, aqueous base developable molecular glass resist, 3Ep, is presented that is developable in both standard organic solvents and aqueous base developers. The resist shows slightly better imaging performance in organic solvent versus aqueous base and shows a shift of E0 away from zero dose. Compared to a previously reported 4Ep resist, 3Ep appears to have a more controlled polymerization rate at equivalent conditions, which results in higher-quality patterned features. 3Ep also requires use of an underlayer to avoid de-wetting during aqueous base development.", "In this paper, we summarize our development efforts for a top-coatless 193nm immersion positive tone development (PTD) contact hole (C/H) resist with improved litho and defect performances for logic application specifically with an advance node. The ultimate performance goal was to improve the depth of focus (DoF) margin, mask error enhancement factor (MEEF), critical dimension uniformity (CDU), contact edge roughness (CER), and defect performance. Also, the through pitch CD difference was supposed to be comparable to the previous control resist. Effects of polymer and PAG properties have been evaluated for this purpose. The material properties focused in the evaluation study were polymer activation energy (Ea), polymer solubility differentiated by polymerization process types, and diffusion length (DL) and acidity (pKa) of photoacid generator (PAG). Additionally, the impact of post exposure bake (PEB) temperature was investigated for process condition optimization. As a result of this study, a new resist formulation to satisfy all litho and defect performance was developed and production yield was further improved.", "Newly eco-friendly high light transparency film with plant-based materials was investigated to future development of liquid crystal displays and optical devices with water repellency as a chemical design concept of nanoimprint lithography. This procedure is proven to be suitable for material design and the process conditions of ultraviolet curing nanoimprint lithography for green water-repellent film derived from biomass with high-light transparency. The developed formulation of advanced nanoimprinted materials design derived from lactulose and psicose, and the development of suitable UV nanoimprint conditions produced high resolutions of the conical shaped moth-eye regularly-nanostructure less than approximately 200 nm diameter, and acceptable patterning dimensional accuracy by the replication of 100 times of UV nanoimprint lithography cycles. The newly plant-based materials and the process conditions are expected as one of the defect less nanoimprint lithographic technologies in next generation electronic devices.", "With the continuous demand for higher performance of computer chips and memories, device patterns and structures are becoming smaller and more complicated. Hard mask processes have been implemented in various steps in the devise manufacturing, and requirements for those materials are versatile. In this paper, novel organometal materials are presented as a new class of spin on solution in order to support the hard mask process. Type of metals, formulation scheme and processing conditions were carefully designed to meet the fundamental requirements as a spin on solution, and their characteristic properties were investigated in comparison to other conventional films such as spin on carbons (SOC), organic bottom anti-reflective coatings (oBARC) and inorganic films formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Several advantages were identified with these SOMHM materials over other films which include 1) better thermal stability than SOC once fully cured, 2) reworkable with industry standard wet chemistry such as SC-1 where conventional Si-BARC is difficult to remove, 3) a wide range of optical constants to suppress reflection for photoresist imaging, 4) high etch resistance and 5) better gap filling property. Curing conditions showed a significant impact on the performance of SOMHM films, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to elucidate the trends. With SOMHM film as a BARC, photolithographic imaging was demonstrated under ArF immersion conditions with 40nm linewidth patterning.", "Efforts to extend 193 nm lithography have introduced multiple patterning solutions to print a single level layer. Due to this increased complexity, defectivity on each layer is becoming very critical. Micro and multiple line bridges are one of the primary challenges in photolithography contributing to this complexity. These defects originate from several root causes and are difficult to eliminate. Point-of-use filtration plays a significant role on the mitigation of such defects. The impact of filtration rate and pressure was previously documented. In this research, we demonstrate that the combination of membrane and pore size selection, photoresist optimization, and hardware optimization can impact micro and multiple bridge mitigation in a 45 nm line/space pattern created through immersion lithography.", "With the development of the lithography, the demand for critical dimension (CD) and CD uniformity (CDU) has reached a new level, which is harder and harder to achieve. There exists reflection at the interface between photo-resist and substrate during lithography exposure. This reflection has negative impact on CD and CDU control. It is possible to optimize the litho stack and film stack thickness on different lithography conditions. With the optimized stack, the total reflectivity for all incident angles at the interface can be controlled less than 0.5%, ideally 0.1%, which enhances process window (PW) most of the time. The theoretical results are verified by the experiment results from foundry, which helps the foundry achieve the mass production finally.", "Negative tone shrink materials (NSM) suitable for resolution enhancement of negative tone development (NTD) 193nm immersion resists have been developed. While this technology is being expanded to integrated circuits (IC) manufacturing, there still have two major problems to apply various processes. One of them is shrink ID bias which means shrink differences between isolated (I) and dense (D) CDs, and the other one is Y/X shrinkage bias which means shrinkage differences between major axis (Y) and minor axis (X) of the elongated or oval shape pattern. While we have presented the improvement of shrink ID bias at SPIE2014 [1], the reduction of Y/X shrinkage bias was the examination theme for quite some time. In this paper, we present Y/X shrinkage bias of current NTD shrink material, new concept material for Y/X bias reduction and the result of new shrink material. Current NTD shrink model has Y/X bias of 1.6 (Y shrink=16nm) at a mixing bake (MB) of 150\u00b0C on AZ AX2110P NTD elongated pattern of X=70nm and Y=210nm ADI. This means shrinkage of Y has larger shrinkage than X and that makes difficult to apply shrink material. We expected that the characteristic shape of elongated pattern was one of the root-cause for Y/X bias, and then simulated how to achieve equivalent shrinkage at Y and X. We concluded that available resist volume per each Y and X unit was not equivalent and need new shrink concept to solve Y/X bias. Based on our new concept, we prepared new shrink material which has lower Y/X bias and larger shrink amount compared with current NTD shrink material. Finally we have achieved lower Y/X bias from 1.6 to 1.1 at MB150\u00b0C and moreover got higher shrinkage than current NTD shrink material from 10.1nm to 16.7nm.", "It is well known that point-of-use (POU) filtration is an effective means of reducing microbridging defects in lithographic processes involving photoresists. To date, most of the optimization studies have been targeted toward understanding the microbridging defects in positive tone imaging (PTI) process. Considering that negative tone imaging (NTI) process has recently been introduced in advanced technology nodes, we focused our POU filtration studies on understanding the factors that modulate microbridging in NTI and PTI processes. Our studies pointed out that Nylon 6,6 membrane is distinctly more effective in reducing microbridging defects in NTI resists, whereas HDPE membranes show significant improvement in PTI resists. These results were rationalized based on the polarity differences of microbridges in PTI and NTI processes.", "In order to understand the mechanism of the pattern wiggling distortion and to find control knobs for improving wiggle performance of spin-on carbon hard mask materials, we have developed analysis method of underlayer (UL) films by utilizing XPS depth profiling using Gas Cluster Ion Beam(GCIB-XPS). Differences of distributions of elemental compositions from the surface to the bottom of the processed or un-processed films have been visualized by GCIB-XPS analysis. Besides, these achievements allow us to identify fluoro substitution of oxygen during etching process as the control knob for the pattern wiggling distortion.", "The high volume manufacturing with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is delaying due to its light source issue. Therefore, ArF-immersion lithography has still been the most promising technology for down scaling of device pitch. As the limitation of ArF-immersion single patterning is considered to be nearly 40nm half pitch (hp), ArF-immersion lithography has necessity to be extended by combining processes to achieve sub- 20nm hp patterning. Recently, there are many reports about the extension of ArF-immersion lithography, e.g., self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP) and litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE) process. These methods have been realized by the combination of lithography, deposition, and etching. On the other aspect, 1-D layout is adopted for leading devices, which contains additional cut or block litho and etch processes to form 2-D like layout. Thus, according to the progress of down scaling technologies, number of processes increases and the cost of ownership (CoO) can not be neglected. Especially, the number of lithography steps and etching steps has been expanded by the combination of processes, and it has come to occupy a large portion of total manufacturing cost. We have reported that negative tone development (NTD) system using organic solvent developer have enough resolution to achieve fine narrow trench or contact hole patterning, since negative tone imaging enables to apply bright mask for these pattern with significantly high optical image contrast compared to positive tone imaging, and it has contributed high throughput multiple patterning. On the other hand, NTD system is found to be useful not only for leading device node, but also for cost effective process. In this report, we propose the cost effective process using NTD application. In the viewpoint of cost down at exposure tool, we have developed KrF-NTD resist which is customized for organic solvent developer. Our KrF-NTD resist has resolution comparable with ArF positive tone development (PTD) resist in narrow trench pattern, and it realizes downgrade of exposure tool. Also, we propose litho-litho-etch process with NTD resist. This method can reduce etching process and decrease total manufacturing cost more directly.", "Recently there has been a great deal of effort focused on increasing EUV scanner source power; which is correlated to increased wafer throughput of production systems. Another way of increasing throughput would be to increase the photospeed of the photoresist used. However increasing the photospeed without improving the overall lithographic performance, such as local critical dimension uniformity (L-CDU) and process window, does not deliver the overall improvements required for a high volume manufacturing (HVM). This paper continues a discussion started in prior publications [Ref 3,4,6], which focused on using readily available process tooling (currently in use for 193 nm double patterning applications) and the existing EUV photoresists to increase photospeed (lower dose requirement) for line and space applications. Techniques to improve L-CDU for contact hole applications will also be described.", "This talk will examine the evolutionary path of optical lithography without EUV. We explore the previous history to understand the various solutions that have emerged. This will give insight into future possibilities. We will examine the possible limits and fundamental problems moving into the sub-10nm node regime. Finally, the cost implications and future technologies are explored.", "In this paper we extend our work into the impact of Mask Topography induced effects in current state of the art lithography by looking at the phase in the diffracted orders. By analyzing and describing the phase in a similar and systematic way as done for projection lenses, we could identify already known effects as best focus differences and pattern asymmetry, but also a new significant effect was found: contrast loss. We used the phase range in the diffracted orders as a metric to be used during lithography set-up. We were able to link the performance of different mask absorber types and parameters with the phase range in the diffracted orders.", "In 7mn node (N7), the logic design requires the critical poly pitch (CPP) of 42-45nm and metal 1 (M1) pitch of 28- 32nm. Such high pattern density pushes the 193 immersion lithography solution toward its limit and also brings extremely complex patterning scenarios. The N7 M1 layer may require a self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) with triple litho-etch (LE3) block process. Therefore, the whole patterning process flow requires multiple exposure+etch+deposition processes and each step introduces a particular impact on the pattern profiles and the topography. In this study, we have successfully integrated a simulation tool that enables emulation of the whole patterning flow with realistic process-dependent 3D profile and topology. We use this tool to study the patterning process variations of N7 M1 layer including the overlay control, the critical dimension uniformity (CDU) budget and the lithographic process window (PW). The resulting 3D pattern structure can be used to optimize the process flow, verify design rules, extract parasitics, and most importantly, simulate the electric field and identify hot spots for dielectric reliability. As an example application, we will report extractions of maximum electric field at M1 tipto- tip which is one of the most critical patterning locations and we will demonstrate the potential of this approach for investigating the impact of process variations on dielectric reliability. We will also present simulations of an alternative M1 patterning flow, with a single exposure block using extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) and analyze its advantages compared to the LE3 block approach.", "Double-patterning ArF immersion lithography continues to advance the patterning resolution and overlay requirements and has enabled the continuation of semiconductor bit-scaling. Over the years Lithography Engineers continue to focus on CD control, overlay and process capability to meet current node requirements for yield and device performance. Reducing or eliminating variability in any process will have significant impact, but the sources of variability in any lithography process are many. The goal from the light source manufacturer is to further enable capability and reduce variation through a number of parameters.\nRecent improvements in bandwidth control have been realized in the XLR platform with Cymer\u2019s DynaPulseTM control technology. This reduction in bandwidth variation could translate in the further reduction of CD variation in device structures. The Authors will discuss the impact that these improvements in bandwidth control have on advanced lithography applications. This can translate to improved CD control and higher wafer yields. A simulation study investigates the impact of bandwidth on contrast sensitive device layers such as contacts and 1x metal layers. Furthermore, the Authors will discuss the impact on process window through pitch and the overlapping process window through pitch that has been investigated. These improvements will be further quantified by the analysis of statistical bandwidth variation and the impact on CD.", "In this paper we present the limitations of 3rd order distortion corrections based on standard overlay metrology and propose a new method to quantify and correct the cold-lens aberration fingerprint. As a result of continuous shrinking features of the integrated circuit, the overlay budget requirements have become very demanding. Historically, most overlay enhancements were achieved by hardware improvements. However there also is a benefit in the computational approach, and so we looked for solutions for overlay improvements in process variation with computational applications.", "Lithography process window (PW) and CD uniformity (CDU) requirements are being challenged with scaling across all device types. Aggressive PW and yield specifications put tight requirements on scanner performance, especially on focus budgets resulting in complicated systems for focus control. In this study, an imec N10 Logic-type test vehicle was used to investigate the E95 bandwidth impact on six different Metal 1 Logic features. The imaging metrics that track the impact of light source E95 bandwidth on performance of hot spots are: process window (PW), line width roughness (LWR), and local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU).\nIn the first section of this study, the impact of increasing E95 bandwidth was investigated to observe the lithographic process control response of the specified logic features. In the second section, a preliminary assessment of the impact of lower E95 bandwidth was performed. The impact of lower E95 bandwidth on local intensity variability was monitored through the CDU of line end features and the LWR power spectral density (PSD) of line/space patterns. The investigation found that the imec N10 test vehicle (with OPC optimized for standard E95 bandwidth of300fm) features exposed at 200fm showed pattern specific responses, suggesting areas of potential interest for further investigation.", "This report presents a model to predict, analyze, and monitor pattern edge placements errors occurring during integrated circuit manufacture. The edge placement errors are driven by overlay and imaging capabilities of scanners and pattering tools. The model can be used to analyze the impact of various imaging strategies on pattern placement statistics of layers composing ICs. Such analysis is essential to both, IC designers and lithography engineers, striving to successfully fabricate complex designs at economical manufacture yields. The report discusses key contributors to the image edge placement errors and presents examples of edge placement predictions based on scanner records. The edge placement error examples presented in this report are based on scanner overlay and CD uniformity performance for the current generation of integrated circuit designs.", "Traditional approaches to improving photolithographic resolution rely on using shorter and shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. This approach faces ever greater challenges each time the operating wavelength is decreased. Recently, alternative approaches to nanoscale photolithography have been introduced that employ photoresists that are sensitive to multiple colors of visible light. One or more colors of light activate the photoresist, and one or more colors of light can subsequently deactivate it. By controlling the spatial patterns of the colors, it is possible to create features with sizes that are far below the diffraction limit. This approach has been demonstrated for laboratory-based fabrication using multiphoton-absorption-based fabrication, but with improvements in materials it shows great promise for semiconductor lithography as well. A number of approaches to two-color photolithography have been demonstrated. A next generation of schemes that involve a third color of light has the potential to improve the performance of multicolor lithography substantially. The basic premises of both two-color and three-color lithography are discussed, and experimental examples of each type of approach are presented.", "In this paper we report on advances in DUV dry photolithography both for etching and implantation of silicon photonic devices. We explain why silicon patterning is a critical building block in silicon photonics and what are the challenges related to that process. Furthermore, it also occurs that some silicon photonic devices need implantation lithographic conditions which are also specific to the technology. For that purpose, we developed a dedicated DUV 193nm implantation lithography to address that need.", "Diffractive mask-aligner lithography is capable to print structures that have a sub-500-nanometer resolution by using non-contact mode. This requires the use of specially designed phase-masks and dedicated illumination conditions in the Mask-Aligner to obtain the optimal exposure conditions, a spectral filter and a polarizer needs to be placed in the beam path. We introduce here mask designs that includes a polarizer on the top side of a photo-mask and a diffractive element on the bottom one. This enables printing of high resolution structures of arbitrary orientation by using a classical mask-aligner in proximity exposure mode.", "Digital Micromirror Device (DMD)-based grayscale lithography is a promising tool for three dimensional (3D) microstructuring of thick-film photoresist since it is a maskless process, provides possibility for the free-form of 3D microstructures, and therefore rapid and cost-effective microfabrication. However, process parameter determination lacks efficient optimization tool, and thus conventional look-up table (indicating the relationship between development depth and exposure dose value under a fixed development time) approach with manual try-and-error adjustment is still gold standard. In this paper, we firstly present a complete \u201cinput target-output parameters\u201d single exposure optimization method for 3D microstructuring utilizing DMD-based grayscale lithography. This numerical optimization based on lithography simulation and sensitivity analysis can automatically optimize a combination of three process parameters for target microstructure; exposure dose pattern, a focal position, and development time. Through a series of experiments using a 20 \u03bcm thick positive photoresist, validity of the proposed optimization approach has been successfully verified. Secondly, with the purpose of further advancing accuracy and improve the uniformity of precision for the target area, a multiple exposure optimization method is proposed. The simulated results proved that the multiple exposure optimization method is a promising strategy to further improve precision for thicker photoresist structure.", "The mask plays a significant role as an active optical element in lithography, for both EUV and immersion lithography. Mask-induced and feature dependent shifts of the best focus position and other aberration-like effects were reported both for deep ultraviolet (DUV) immersion and for EUV lithography. We employ rigorous computation of light diffraction from lithographic masks in combination with aerial image simulation to study the root causes of these effects and their dependencies from mask and optical system parameters. Special emphasis is put on the comparison of transmission masks for DUV lithography and reflective masks for EUV lithography, respectively.", "The proximity printing industry is in real need of high resolution results and it can be done using Phase Shift Mask (PSM) or by applying Optical Proximity Correction (OPC). In our research we are trying to find out details of how light fields behind the structures of photo masks develop in order to determine the best conditions and designs for proximity printing. We focus here on parameters that are used in real situation with gaps up to 50 \u03bcm and structure sizes down to 2 \u03bcm. The light field evolution behind the structures is studied and delivers insight in to precisions and tolerances that need to be respected. It is the first time that an experimental analysis of light propagation through mask is presented in detail, which includes information on intensity and phase. The instrument we use is known as High Resolution Interference Microscopy (HRIM). HRIM is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer which is capable of recording three dimensional distributions of intensity and phase with diffraction limited resolution. Our characterization technique allows plotting the evolution of the desired light field and therefore printable structure till the desired proximity gap. In this paper we discuss in detail the evolution of intensity and phase fields of elbow or corner structure at different position behind a phase mask and interpret the main parameters. Of particular interest are tolerances against proximity gap variation and the resolution in printed structures.", "Printing contact-like cut mask form the line end of very dense pitches is imposing a significant challenge to lithography. Various lithography options including optical multi-patterning and EUV have been considered for sub-20nm half pitch metal line cut process. Different lithography solutions of cut mask will impose different design restrictions and thus lead to different scalability of chip. In this paper, we will study routing limitations of sub-20nm half pitch metal lines cut with various optical and EUV lithography options. Key metal routing rules for each cut mask option will be derived based on study of forbidden cut mask configurations. The associated logic area impact will be derived based on real digital design.", "We present a novel optimisation algorithm for inverse lithography, based on optimization of the mask derivative, a domain inherently sparse, and for rectilinear polygons, invertible. The method is first developed assuming a point light source, and then extended to general incoherent sources. What results is a fast algorithm, producing manufacturable masks (the search space is constrained to rectilinear polygons), and flexible (specific constraints such as minimal line widths can be imposed). One inherent trick is to treat polygons as continuous entities, thus making aerial image calculation extremely fast and accurate. Requirements for mask manufacturability can be integrated in the optimization without too much added complexity. We also explain how to extend the scheme for phase-changing mask optimization.", "We present results generated using a new gauge-based Resolution Enhancement Technique (RET) Selection flow during the technology set up phase of a 3x-node NAND Flash product. As a testcase, we consider a challenging critical level for this ash product. The RET solutions include inverse lithography technology (ILT) optimized masks with sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) and companion illumination sources developed using a new pixel based Source Mask Optimization (SMO) tool that uses measurement gauges as a primary input. The flow includes verification objectives which allow tolerancing of particular measurement gauges based on lithographic criteria. Relative importance for particular gauges may also be set, to aid in down-selection from several candidate sources. The end result is a sensitive, objective score of RET performance. Using these custom-defined importance metrics, decisions on the final RET style can be made in an objective way.", "Source mask optimization (SMO) was considered to be one of the key resolution enhancement techniques for node technology below 20 nm prior to the availability of extreme-ultraviolet tools. SMO has been shown to enlarge the process margins for the critical layer in SRAM and memory cells. In this study, a new illumination shape optimization approach was developed on the basis of the ant colony optimization (ACO) principle. The use of this heuristic pixel-based ACO method in the SMO process provides an advantage over the extant SMO method because of the gradient of the cost function associated with the rapid and stable searching capability of the proposed method. This study was conducted to provide lithographic engineers with references for the quick determination of the optimal illumination shape for complex mask patterns. The test pattern used in this study was a contact layer for SRAM design, with a critical dimension and a minimum pitch of 55 and 110 nm, respectively. The optimized freeform source shape obtained using the ACO method was numerically verified by performing an aerial image investigation, and the result showed that the optimized freeform source shape generated an aerial image profile different from the nominal image profile and with an overall error rate of 9.64%. Furthermore, the overall average critical shape difference was determined to be 1.41, which was lower than that for the other off-axis illumination exposure. The process window results showed an improvement in exposure latitude (EL) and depth of focus (DOF) for the ACO-based freeform source shape compared with those of the Quasar source shape. The maximum EL of the ACO-based freeform source shape reached 7.4% and the DOF was 56 nm at an EL of 5%.", "The Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) model, a key to process yield in the mask synthesis flow, is getting more and more complicated and challenging at advanced technology nodes (1X nm). To achieve accurate critical dimension (CD) prediction and model robustness on varied designed patterns, a rigorously tuned compact model (RTCM) [1] that takes the photoresist chemical effects into considerations is strongly desired. A lithography process consists of three main stages: Exposure, Post-Exposure Bake (PEB), and Photoresist Development. Each stage is characterized by its fundamental physics or chemistry that governs the process of illumination induced photo-acid generation, thermally activated chemical reaction-diffusion, and developer dependent photoresist dissolution, respectively. The final resist profile is determined by the process details of all these stages directly or indirectly. For an ideal resist that the development contrast approaches infinity, resist development is aptly represented by a threshold model applied to the PEB latent image (acid or inhibitor concentration). So the quality of OPC modeling is largely determined by the fidelity of PEB latent image [2,3]. However, for some types of resist and developer used in Negative Tone Development (NTD), the development contrast shows a long tail without a sharp transition. For such low-contrast resist, the developed resist profile is no longer described well by the equilevel surface of PEB latent image. Going beyond the threshold approximation, we start from the fundamental equations of resist development physics and analyze the time evolution of development front that determines the resist profile. In this paper, a new compact model is derived to catch the main physics in resist Development, which is also simple and computationally efficient to suit for OPC applications. Comparison with S-LITHO rigorous solutions and real-wafer experiments with 1D and 2D test patterns have showed that the new compact model, with fewer free parameters, provides better CD prediction than the existing empirical lumped parameter models for low-contrast resists. The new physical compact model offers a more accurate and extendable solution for OPC modeling at the 10nm node and onward.", "Mask topography contributes diffraction-induced phase near edges, affecting the through-focus intensity variation and hence the process window at the wafer. We analyze the impact of edge diffraction on projection printing directly with experiments on an aerial image measurement system (AIMS). We show here that topographic effects change with illumination angle and can be quantified using through-focus intensity measurements. Off- axis incidence influences not just defocus image behavior (as for normal incidence), but also the at-focus intensity at wafer. Moreover, with oblique illumination, mask diffraction varies for left-facing and right-facing sidewalls, the nature of the asymmetry being polarization dependent. The image degradation due the polarization parallel to the sidewall (TE) is seen to be stronger, owing to the interplay of mask topography and pupil filtering in the imaging system. This translates to a CD variation of 2% between the two polarizations, even at focus. A simple thin-mask boundary layer model that treats each sidewall independently is shown to be able to approximate mask topography induced diffraction for both polarizations with 5-10nm wide boundary layers.", "The physical process of mask manufacturing produces absorber geometry with significantly less than 90 degree fidelity at corners. The non-Manhattan mask geometry is an essential contributor to the aerial image and resulting patterning performance through focus. Current state of the art models for corner rounding employ \u201cchopping\u201d a 90 degree mask corner, replacing the corner with a small 45 degree edge. In this paper, a methodology is presented to approximate the impact of 3D EMF effects introduced by corners with rounded edges. The approach is integrated into a full chip 3D mask simulation methodology based on the Domain Decomposition Method (DDM) with edge to edge crosstalk correction.", "As the critical dimension keeps shrinking, mask topography effect (Mask3D) becomes considerable to impact the lithography modeling accuracy and the quality of full-chip OPC. Among many challenges in Mask3D modeling, it is critical and particularly demanding to treat off-axis illumination (OAI) properly. In this paper, we present a novel Mask3D model that is completely test pattern- and optics- independent. Such model property enables greatly improved performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on various pattern types (1D/2D) and through a wide range of focus conditions, while no runtime overhead is incurred. The novel model and formulation will be able to save significant modeling time and greatly improve the model reliability, predictability and ease of use. Experimental results validate the claims and demonstrate the superiority to the current state-of-the-art Mask3D modeling method. This is a new generation Mask3D modeling process.", "One of the main concerns about EUV lithography is whether or not it can be extended to very high numerical aperture. Recently, a waveguide effect in high-NA EUV lithography was observed. This effect serves to overcome the problem of shadowing in EUV lithography and allows EUV lithography to be extended to the 4-nm node. In this paper, an exact eigenmode analysis is presented to explain the observed effect. This waveguide effect is then applied to simulate the printing of 4-nm lines and spaces with excellent aerial-image contrast and peak intensity. The feasibility of EUV lithography for printing logic circuits containing general 2D patterns with 4-nm feature size is also demonstrated.", "We have been utilizing rigorous simulation software in order to predict the alignment mark signal quality and mark contrast variation induced by processes changes reliably. We have run simulations in order to understand which parameters influence alignment mark quality most and to determine the important parameters that can be manipulated in order to improve it. Simulation of alignment signals (also referred to as waveforms) has been done for resist marks and etched marks, coated and uncoated, as well as in presence of increasing topography complexity. To validate simulation analysis, mark signal collection for different processes (and/or variations of those) and products has been carried out; cross sections have also been generated.", "Two aspects of NTD resists, deprotection-induced shrinkage, and retrograde sidewalls, are investigated through experimentation and simulation.\nSimulation predicts that NTD resist profiles should often have retrograde sidewall angles due to the attenuation of light as it propagates down through the resist. Resist shrinkage induced from both the de-protection during PEB and from exposure to electrons during SEM can cause CD and sidewall changes. The interplay between the shrinkage and the retrograde sidewalls is discussed.\nDeprotection-induced shrinkage is measured by AFM while SEM induced shrinkage is estimated from repeated SEM measurements. SEM images for various features are analyzed and compared to simulation.", "A novel approach to Sub-Resolution Assist Feature (SRAF) generation suitable for full-chip production scale applications is discussed in this work. The method enables generation of free-form SRAF insertion guidelines similar to those obtained by solving the inverse lithography problem. The guidelines encompass layout areas where total net effect of an elementary SRAF placement is positive taking into account all neighboring target features. The essence of the method is the assumption that the total impact of placing an elementary SRAF close to several neighboring features can be calculated as a sum of impacts to individual target features, or a simple mathematical function could be used to perform this calculation. Reduction of the SRAF insertion problem to the linear addition of \u201cusefulness\u201d metric on a grid enables the method to be exceptionally computationally efficient. Tests on an aggressive 28nm 100x100 um design contact array clips have confirmed 3+ orders of magnitude faster free-form SRAF generation as compared to commercially available ILT engines.", "Traditionally, an image parameter metric has been used to analyze the lithography and resist responses versus the test pattern coverage. This metric assumes a variable threshold resist model which is not necessarily the state-of-the art model type used in the latest technology nodes. Additionally, these methods don\u2019t consider the statistical nature of the variations where the number of the selected patterns can greatly affect the uncertainty of the model prediction for another set of patterns. We propose a new method that combines the lithography response with uncertainty analysis to select test patterns for OPC model calibration. We also propose a new metric based on resist response to be considered in site selection for advanced resist models. We show that uncertainty aware site selection combined with this new metric gives similar or better model accuracy compared to baseline which requires engineering expertise and other site clustering tools, but with large amount of calibration site reduction. Examples from advanced nodes are given.", "OPC models have become critical in the manufacturing of integrated circuits (ICs) by allowing correction of complex designs, as we approach the physical limits of scaling in IC chip design. The accuracy of these models depends upon the ability of the calibration set to sufficiently cover the design space, and be manageable enough to address metrology constraints. We show that the proposed method provides results of at least similar quality, in some cases superior quality compared to both the traditional method and sample plan sets of higher size. The main advantage of our method over the existing ones is that it generates a calibration set much faster, considering a large initial set and even more importantly, by automatically selecting its minimum optimal size.", "Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is one of the most important techniques in today's optical lithography based manufacturing process. Although the most widely used model-based OPC is expected to achieve highly accurate correction, it is also known to be extremely time-consuming. This paper proposes a regression model for OPC using a Hierarchical Bayes Model (HBM). The goal of the regression model is to reduce the number of iterations in model-based OPC. Our approach utilizes a Bayes inference technique to learn the optimal parameters from given data. All parameters are estimated by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Experimental results show that utilizing HBM can achieve a better solution than other conventional models, e.g., linear regression based model, or non-linear regression based model. In addition, our regression results can be fed as the starting point of conventional model based OPC, through which we are able to overcome the runtime bottleneck.", "Continued improvements in SEM contour extraction capabilities have enabled calibrating more accurate OPC models for advanced technology nodes using a hybrid approach, combining CDs for 1D structures and full contour measurements for more complex 2D patterns. Previous work has addressed various components of contour modeling including alignment, edge detection, CD to contour consistency, and image parameter space coverage. This study covers weighting strategies for CDs compared to contours. Additionally the total number of structures in a sample plan can be reduced by incorporating contours for model calibration due to the increased number of evaluation points they provide.\nRepeated measurements of the same structure at separate locations are used to extract SEM contours across several instances. The average measurements from these locations can then be used for OPC model calibration. Using 14nm process data, it is shown that including more contours in hybrid OPC model calibration leads to improved model verification. Within an appropriate range, higher weight on the contour patterns leads to improved model verification on measurement sites unseen by the calibration set. Calibrating a model with fewer contour structures, but at higher weight shows improvement over standard CD only model calibration.", "A resist cross-sectional profile becomes worse as feature sizes shrink. The bad resist profile could result in a hotspot after etching process (after-etch hotspot). Conventional simulation method is difficult to detect such hotspots accurately because it does not consider process variation. In this paper, we propose an accurate after-etch hotspot detection methodology with consideration of process variation based on optical intensity and defect rate. An experimental result shows our method can detect an after-etch hotspot accurately.", "Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is a compute-intensive process used to generate photolithography mask shapes at advanced VLSI nodes. Previously, we reported a modified two-step OPC flow which consists of a first pattern replacement step followed by a model based OPC correction step [1]. We build on this previous work and show how this hybrid flow not only improves full chip OPC runtime, but also significantly improves mask correction consistency and overall mask quality. This is demonstrated using a design from the 20nm node, which requires the use of model based SRAF followed by model based OPC to obtain the full mask solution.", "To accord with new requirement of securing more overlay margin, not only the optical overlay measurement is faced with the technical limitations to represent cell pattern\u2019s behavior, but also the larger measurement samples are inevitable for minimizing statistical errors and better estimation of circumstance in a lot. From these reasons, diffraction based overlay (DBO) and integrated metrology (IM) were mainly proposed as new approaches for overlay enhancement in this paper.", "The use of extreme freeform illumination conditions and multi patterning processes used to generate sub 40nm images can result in significant intra-field overlay errors. When levels with differing illumination conditions are aligned to each other, these intra-field distortions can result in overlay errors which are uncorrectable using normal linear feedback corrections.\nWe use a double exposure method, previously described by Minghetti [1] et al. to isolate and measure intra-field overlay distortions caused by tool lens signatures and different illumination conditions. A full field test reticle is used to create a dual level expose pattern. The same pattern is exposed twice, but with two different illumination conditions. The first exposure is done with a standard reference illumination. The second exposure is the target illumination condition. The test reticle has overlay target pairs that are measurable when the 2nd exposure is offset in the Y direction by the designed amount. This allows for a high density, 13x13, intra-field overlay measurement to be collected and modeled to determine 2nd and 3rd order intra-field terms. Since the resulting illumination and scanner lens specific intra field corrections are independent of field size, the sub-recipes can be applied to any product exposure independent of field size, which use the same illumination conditions as the test exposures. When the method is applied to all exposure levels in a product build cycle, the overlay errors contributed by the reference illumination condition cancel out. The remaining errors are due exclusively to the impact of the illumination condition on that scanner lens.\nActual results correlated well with the model with more than 80% of the predicted overlay improvement being achieved.", "For mass production of DRAM device, a stable and effective overlay control becomes more and more important as DRAM design rule shrinks. Existent technologies were already applied to overcome this situation. Nevertheless, we are still suffered from tight overlay margin and forced to move from lot-based to wafer-based overlay control. However, the wafer-based control method requires a huge amount of measurement resource.\nIn this paper, we present the insight for the wafer-based overlay correction with optimal measurement resource which is suitable for mass production. The experiment which is the wafer-based overlay correction by several statistical analyses carried out for 2X nm node DRAM. Among them, linear regression is a strong candidate for wafer-based overlay control, which improved up to 0.8 nm of maximum overlay.", "Progressing towards the 10nm and 7nm imaging node, pattern-placement and layer-to-layer overlay requirements keep on scaling down and drives system improvements in immersion (ArFi) and dry (ArF/KrF) scanners. A series of module enhancements in the NXT platform have been introduced; among others, the scanner is equipped with exposure stages with better dynamics and thermal control. Grid accuracy improvements with respect to calibration, setup, stability, and layout dependency tighten MMO performance and enable mix and match scanner operation. The same platform improvements also benefit focus control. Improvements in detectability and reproducibility of low contrast alignment marks enhance the alignment solution window for 10nm logic processes and beyond. The system\u2019s architecture allows dynamic use of high-order scanner optimization based on advanced actuators of projection lens and scanning stages. This enables a holistic optimization approach for the scanner, the mask, and the patterning process. Productivity scanner design modifications esp. stage speeds and optimization in metrology schemes provide lower layer costs for customers using immersion lithography as well as conventional dry technology. Imaging, overlay, focus, and productivity data is presented, that demonstrates 10nm and 7nm node litho-capability for both (immersion & dry) platforms.", "In order to achieve stable operation in cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing, Nikon has developed NSR-S630D with extremely accurate overlay while maintaining throughput in various conditions resembling a real production environment. In addition, NSR-S630D has been equipped with enhanced capabilities to maintain long-term overlay stability and user interface improvement all due to our newly developed application software platform. In this paper, we describe the most recent S630D performance in various conditions similar to real productions. In a production environment, superior overlay accuracy with high dose conditions and high throughput are often required; therefore, we have performed several experiments with high dose conditions to demonstrate NSR\u2019s thermal aberration capabilities in order to achieve world class overlay performance. Furthermore, we will introduce our new software that enables long term overlay performance.", "Semiconductor market demand for improved performance at lower cost continues to drive enhancements in excimer light source technologies. Multi-patterning lithography solutions to extend deep-UV (DUV) immersion have driven requirements such as higher throughput and higher efficiencies to maximize the utilization of leading-edge lithography equipment. Three key light source parameters have direct influence on patterning performance \u2013 energy, wavelength and bandwidth stability \u2013 and they have been the primary areas of continuous improvement. With 14nm node development, a number of studies have shown the direct influence of bandwidth stability on CD uniformity for certain patterns and geometries, leading to the desire for further improvements in this area. More recent studies also examined the impact of bandwidth on 10nm logic node patterning [1]. Alongside these drivers, increasing cost per patterning layer continues to demand further improvements in operating costs and efficiencies from the lithography tools, and the light source can offer further gains in these areas as well. This paper introduces several light source technologies that are embodied in a next-generation light source, the Cymer XLR\u00ae 700ix, which is an extension of the ring laser architecture introduced 8 years ago. These technologies enable a significant improvement in bandwidth stability as well as notable reductions in operating costs through more efficient gas management algorithms and lower facilities costs.", "Along with device shrinkage, higher accuracy will continuously be required from photo-lithography tools in order to enhance on-product yield. In order to achieve higher yield, the advanced photo-lithography tools must be equipped with sophisticated tuning knobs on the tool and with software that is flexible enough to be applied per layer. This means photo-lithography tools must be capable of handling many types of sub-recipes and parameters simultaneously.\nTo enable managing such a large amount of data easily and to setup lithography tools smoothly, we have developed a total lithography system called Litho Turnkey Solution based on a new software application platform, which we call Plug and Play Manager (PPM). PPM has its own graphical user interface, which enables total management of various data. Here various data means recipes, sub-recipes, tuning-parameters, measurement results, and so on. Through PPM, parameter making by intelligent applications such as CDU/Overlay tuning tools can easily be implemented. In addition, PPM is also linked to metrology tools and the customer\u2019s host computer, which enables data flow automation. Based on measurement data received from the metrology tools, PPM calculates correction parameters and sends them to the scanners automatically. This scheme can make calibration feedback loops possible. It should be noted that the abovementioned functions are running on the same platform through a user-friendly interface. This leads to smart scanner management and usability improvement.\nIn this paper, we will demonstrate the latest development status of Nikon\u2019s total lithography solution based on PPM; describe details of each application; and provide supporting data for the accuracy and usability of the system. Keywords: exposure", "The difficulty of EUV lithography system development has prolonged the industry\u2019s dependence on ArF excimer lasers to realize further advancements in lithography process technologies. Smaller CD with reduced cost requires tighter specifications, and the potential extension to 450mm wafers introduces extremely difficult performance challenges on lasers. One of the most important features of the next generation lasers will be the ability to support green operations while further improving cost of ownership and performance. For example, electricity consumption costs and the dependence on rare gases, such as neon and helium, will become critical considerations for HVM process going forward. As a laser vendor, Gigaphoton continues to innovate and develop solutions that address these important issues. The latest model GT64A with its field-proven, twin-chamber platform has reduced environmental impact while upgrading performance and power. A variety of green technologies are employed on the GT64A. The first is the reduction of gas usage. Parameters, such as input power and gas pressure are closely monitored during operations and fed back to the injection/exhaust gas controller system. By applying a special algorithm, the laser gas consumption can be reduced by up to 50%. More than 96% of the gas used by the lasers is neon. Another rare gas that requires attention is Helium. Recently the unstable supply of helium became a serious worldwide issue. To cope with this situation, Gigaphoton is developing lasers that support completely helium-free operations.", "In optical lithography, high-performance exposure tools are necessary to obtain not only fine patterns but also preciseness of the pattern width. Therefore, an accurate theoretical method is necessary to predict these values in practice. Conversely speaking, lithography experiments enables us to evaluate the validity of imaging theory. Thus some pioneer and valuable studies have been argued [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. However there might be some ambiguity or no consensus for the treatment of diffraction by object in scalar imaging theory and a paradoxical phenomenon for the inclined entrance plane wave especially in vector imaging theory. Therefore we reconsider the imaging theory and compare the theoretical aerial image intensity with experimental pattern width.", "As DUV multi-patterning requirements continue to become more stringent, it is critical that all sources of lithography patterning variability are characterized and monitored. Advanced process characterization studies have been enabled using Cymer\u2019s novel technique to modulate Beam Divergence and Polarization, and Energy, Bandwidth, or Wavelength light source performance. These techniques have been instrumental in helping identify process sensitivities that enable proactive light source monitoring and excursion detection using SmartPulseTM.\nDemonstration of the benefits of these technologies is provided through results from recent experiments at imec. Changes in patterning performance are characterized using top down CD-SEM metrology, enabling excellent correlation between optical parameters and on wafer attributes for typical patterning geometries. In addition, new results show that changes in laser beam parameter performance can have measurable wafer patterning and/or illumination impacts. Chipmakers can benefit from the use of this capability to perform proactive, comprehensive characterization of current and next generation process nodes.", "In high-NA and hyper-NA lithography systems, the polarization aberration of projection lens leads to imaging degradations. Typically, numerical simulations are used to explore the relationship. In this paper, analytical analysis for the impact of polarization aberration of projection lens on the aerial image of alternating phase-shift mask (Alt-PSM) is realized. The analytical expressions of image placement error (IPE) and best focus shift (BFS) caused by polarization aberration are derived from the intensity of aerial image. The derived expressions match simulation results extremely well, and can be used to understand more fully the detrimental impact of polarization aberration on lithographic imaging quality. The linear relationships between IPE and odd items of Pauli-Zernike polarization aberrations, as well as that between BFS and even items of Pauli-Zernike polarization aberrations are established, using linear polarization illumination. The accuracy of the linear relationships is assessed by the least square method.", "As the scaling down of design rule for high-density memory device, the small depth of focus (DoF) budget may be deteriorated by focus leveling errors, which arises in unpredicted reflectivity from multilayer structures on the topographic wafer. The leveling sensors of ASML scanner use near infrared (NIR) range wavelength which can penetrate through most of films using in semiconductor fabrication such as photo-resist, bottom anti reflective coating (BARC) and dielectric materials. Consequently, the reflected light from underlying substructures would disturb leveling sensors from accurate leveling. The different pattern densities and layout characteristics between array and periphery of a memory chip are expected to result in different leveling signals. Furthermore, the process dependent variations between wafer central and edge areas are also considered to yield different leveling performances during wafer exposure.\nIn this study, lower blind contact immunity was observed for peripheral contacts comparing to the array contacts especially around wafer edge region. In order to overcome this problem, a series of investigations have been carried out. The wafer edge leveling optimization through circuit dependent focus edge clearance (CDFEC) option doesn\u2019t get improvement. Air gauge improved process leveling (AGILE) function of ASML immersion scanner doesn\u2019t show improved result either. The ILD uniformity improvement and step height treatments around wafer edge such as edge exclusion of film deposition and bevel etching are also ineffective to mitigate the blind contact problem of peripheral patterns. Altering the etch hard-mask stack is finally found to be an effective approach to alleviate the issue. For instance, through either containing high temperature deposition advanced patterning film (APF) in the hard-mask or inserting higher opaque film such as amorphous Si in between the hard-mask stack.", "Aerial image calculation is the basis of the current lithography simulation. As the critical dimension (CD) of the integrated circuits continuously shrinks, the thick mask near-field calculation has increasing influence on the accuracy and efficiency of the entire aerial image calculation process. This paper develops a flexible librarybased approach to significantly improve the efficiency of the thick mask near-field calculation compared to the rigorous modeling method, while leading to much higher accuracy than the Kirchhoff approximation method. Specifically, a set of typical features on the fullchip are selected to serve as the training data, whose near-fields are pre-calculated and saved in the library. Given an arbitrary test mask, we first decompose it into convex corners, concave corners and edges, afterwards match each patch to the training layouts based on nonparametric kernel regression. Subsequently, we use the matched near-fields in the library to replace the mask patches, and rapidly synthesize the near-field for the entire test mask. Finally, a data-fitting method is proposed to improve the accuracy of the synthesized near-field based on least square estimate (LSE). We use a pair of two-dimensional mask patterns to test our method. Simulations show that the proposed method can significantly speed up the current FDTD method, and effectively improve the accuracy of the Kirchhoff approximation method.", "The impact of mask three dimensions (M3D) effect on lithography processes is getting more pronounced from 32 nm nodes1-2. In this paper, we report four research progresses on the M3Deffect. Firstly, the impacts of M3D effect on the best focus (BF) offset were studied with though pitch as test pattern. The M3D effect has negative impacts on the BF, generating the BF offset pattern by pattern. The BF offset strongly depends on MoSi film thickness (THK). However the impact of MoSi profile, or side wall angle (SWA) could be ignored. Secondly, M3D OPC is needed to mitigate the shift of dose and focus center. Thirdly, as long as enough shade, the thinner MoSi, the less BF shift, as electromagnetic field (EMF) effect makes space behave smaller, which leads to higher contrast but higher mask error enhancement factor(MEEF); So the trade-off between contrast and MEEF is needed. And MoSi THK 43.7 nm in production supposed to be the optimized value from this study. Finally, compared to attenuating phase shifting mask (att.PSM) mask, opaque MoSi on Glass (OMOG) mask is more robust in terms of MEEF, the normalized image logarithmic slope (NILS) etc., not obviously influenced by mask duty ratio.", "The new ArF Immersion Laser, GT64A has been developed to support the next generation multiple-patterning process. It offers the industry\u2019s highest output power of 120W with high stability and efficiency. 120W output power with auto-adjusting function enables to meet the requirements of various processes and makes higher-throughput possible even at 450mm-wafers. The increased wavelength stability and bandwidth stability can further improve overlay accuracy and CD error required for the next generation multiple-patterning lithography. Advanced gas control algorithm reduces the consumption of rare gases such as neon to a half. Helium-free operation is also under development to cope with the unstable supply of helium gases worldwide.\nNew advanced wavelength control and bandwidth control algorithm has been developed to meet tighter stability requirement for the next generation multiple-patterning lithography.", "Forbidden pitches are the result of unwanted, non-linear effects that limit yield and not always well understood. Yet, as approximations, they are implicitly deployed through design rules. Many believe they result as a consequence of more complicated light sources. We develop an analytical model of aerial image quality as a function of light source. We show the effect is most pronounced for a point light source, the simplest of all. We develop a method to improve print image quality by illumination source optimization, and show promising first results. Additionally, it is shown how design rules capture forbidden pitches unsatisfactorily.", "In recent years, with the availability of freeform sources, source optimization has emerged as one of the key techniques for achieving higher resolution without increasing the complexity of mask design. In this paper, an efficient source optimization approach using particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. The sources are represented by pixels and encoded into particles. The pattern fidelity is adopted as the fitness function to evaluate these particles. The source optimization approach is implemented by updating the velocities and positions of these particles. The approach is demonstrated by using two typical mask patterns, including a periodic array of contact holes and a vertical line/space design. The pattern errors are reduced by 66.1% and 39.3% respectively. Compared with the source optimization approach using genetic algorithm, the proposed approach leads to faster convergence while improving the image quality at the same time. The robustness of the proposed approach to initial sources is also verified.", "Mask aligner lithography is very attractive for less-critical lithography layers and is widely used for LED, display, CMOS image sensor, micro-fluidics and MEMS manufacturing. Mask aligner lithography is also a preferred choice the semiconductor back-end for 3D-IC, TSV interconnects, advanced packaging (AdP) and wafer-level-packaging (WLP). Mask aligner lithography is a mature technique based on shadow printing and has not much changed since the 1980s. In shadow printing lithography a geometric pattern is transferred by free-space propagation from a photomask to a photosensitive layer on a wafer. The inherent simplicity of the pattern transfer offers ease of operation, low maintenance, moderate capital expenditure, high wafers-per-hour (WPH) throughput, and attractive cost-of-ownership (COO). Advanced mask aligner lithography (AMALITH) comprises different measures to improve shadow printing lithography beyond current limits. The key enabling technology for AMALITH is a novel light integrator systems, referred to as MO Exposure Optics\u00ae (MOEO). MOEO allows to fully control and shape the properties of the illumination light in a mask aligner. Full control is the base for accurate simulation and optimization of the shadow printing process (computational lithography). Now photolithography enhancement techniques like customized illumination, optical proximity correction (OPC), phase masks (AAPSM), half-tone lithography and Talbot lithography could be used in mask aligner lithography. We summarize the recent progress in advanced mask aligner lithography (AMALITH) and discuss possible measures to further improve shadow printing lithography.", "As shrinkage of design features progresses, the difference in best focus positions among different patterns is becoming a fatal issue, especially when many patterns co-exist in a layer. The problem arises from three major factors: aberrations of projection optics, mask 3D topography effects, and resist thickness effects. Aberrations in projection optics have already been thoroughly investigated, but mask 3D topography effects and resist thickness effects are still under study. It is well known that mask 3D topography effects can be simulated by various Electro-magnetic Field (EMF) analysis methods. However, it is almost impossible to use them for full chip modeling because all of these methods are extremely computationally intensive. Consequently, they usually apply only to a limited range of mask patterns which are about tens of square micro meters in area. Resist thickness effects on best focus positions are rarely treated as a topic of lithography investigations. Resist 3D effects are treated mostly for resist profile prediction, which also requires an intensive EMF analysis when one needs to predict it accurately. In this paper, we present a simplified Virtual Aberration (VA) model to simulate both mask 3D induced effects and resist thickness effects. A conventional simulator, when applied with this simplified method, can factor in both mask 3D topography effects and resist thickness effects. Thus it can be used to model inter-pattern Best Focus Difference (BFD) issues with the least amount of rigorous EMF analysis.", "With the introduction of negative tone develop (NTD) resists to production lithography nodes, multiple NTD resist modeling challenges have surpassed the accuracy limits of the existing modeling infrastructure developed for the positive polarity process. We report the evaluation of two NTD resist modeling algorithms. The new modeling terms represent, from the first principles, the NTD resist mechanisms of horizontal shrink and horizontal development bias. Horizontal shrink describes the impact of the physical process of out-gassing on remaining resist edge location. Horizontal development bias accounts for the differential in the peak and minimum development rate with exposure intensity observed in NTD formulations. We review specific patterning characteristics by feature type, modeling accuracy impact presented by these NTD mechanisms, and their description in our compact models (Compact Model 1, CM1). All the new terms complement the accuracy advantage observed with existing CM1 resist modeling infrastructure. The new terms were tested on various NTD layers. The results demonstrate consistent model accuracy improvement for both calibration and verification. Furthermore, typical NTD model fitting challenges, such as large SRAF-induced wafer CD jump, can be overcome by the new NTD terms. Finally, we propose a joint-tuning approach for the calibration of compact models for the NTD resist.", "The optical proximity correction (OPC) model and post-OPC verification that takes the developed photoresist (PR) 3D profile into account is needed in the advanced 2Xnm node. The etch process hotspots caused by poor resist profile may not be fully identified during the lithography inspection but will only be observed after the subsequent etch process. A complete mask correction that targets to final etch CD requires not only a lithography R3D profile model but also a etch process compact model. The drawback of existing etch model is to treat the etch CD bias as a function of visibility and pattern density which do not contain the information of resist profile. One important factor to affect the etch CD is the PR lateral erosion during the etch process due to non-vertical PR side wall angle (SWA) and anisotropy of etch plasma source. A simple example is in transferring patterns from PR layer to thin hard mask (HM) layer, which is frequently used in the double pattern (DPT) process. The PR lateral erosion contributes an extra HM etch CD bias which is deviated from PR CD defined by lithography process. This CD bias is found to have a nontrivial dependency on the PR profile and cannot be described by the pattern density or visibility. In this report, we study the etch CD variation to resist SWA under various etch conditions. Physical effects during etch process such as plasma ion reflection and source anisotropy, which modify the local etch rate, are taken into considerations in simulation. The virtual data are generated by Synopsys TCAD tool Sentaurus Topography 3D using Monte Carlo engine. A simple geometry compact model is applied first to explain the behavior of virtual data, however, it works to some extent but lacks accuracy when plasma ion reflection comes into play. A modified version is proposed, for the first time, by including the effects of plasma ion reflection and source anisotropy. The new compact model fits the nonlinear etch CD bias very well for a wide range of resist SWAs from 65 to 90 degrees, which covers the resist profile diversities in most real situations. This result offers a potential application for both resist profile aware and etch process aware mask correction model in the mask synthesis flow.", "Resist profile shapes become important for 22nm node and beyond as the process window shrinks. Degraded profile shapes for example may induce etching failures. Rigorous resist simulators can simulate a 3D resist profile accurately but they are not fast enough for correction or verification on a full chip. Compact resist models are fast but have traditionally modeled the resist in two dimensions. They provide no information on the resist loss and sidewall angle. However, they can be extended to predict resist profiles by proper setting of optical parameters and by accounting for vertical effects. Large resist shrinkages in NTD resists can also be included in the compact model. This article shows how a compact resist model in Calibre can be used to predict resist profiles and resist contours at arbitrary heights.", "As feature size get smaller, it's crucial to gain depth of focus (DOF) common window in optical lithography. In addition to the DOF of individual patterns, the shift of the best focus between various patterns is significant reducing the common DOF. High-order spatial frequencies diffracted from sharp corners and small patterns on the mask induce additional phase terms and can shift the best focus significantly. We analyzed the correlation between the pattern shape after OPC correction and its corresponding DOF, and found that more complicated shapes lead to more focus shift. Wafer experiment and simulation confirm the predictions. This provides another index for future OPC application.", "To ensure a high patterning quality, the etch effects have to be corrected within the OPC recipe in addition to the traditional lithographic effects. This requires the calibration of an accurate etch model and optimization of its implementation in the OPC flow. Using SEM contours is a promising approach to get numerous and highly reliable measurements especially for 2D structures for etch model calibration. A 28nm active layer was selected to calibrate and verify an etch model with 50 structures in total. We optimized the selection of the calibration structures as well as the model density. The implementation of the etch model to adjust the litho target layer allows a significant reduction of weak points. We also demonstrate that the etch model incorporated to the ORC recipe and run on large design can predict many hotspots.", "The CMOS logic 22nm node was the last one done with single patterning. It used a highly regular layout style with Gridded Design Rules (GDR). Smaller nodes have required the same regular layout style but with multiple patterning for critical layers. A \u201cline/cut\u201d approach is being used to achieve good pattern fidelity and process margin.[1] As shown in Fig. 1, even with \u201cline\u201d patterns, pitch division will eventually be necessary.\nFor the \u201ccut\u201d pattern, Design-Source-Mask Optimization (DSMO) has been demonstrated to be effective at the 20nm node and below.[2,3,4] Single patterning was found to be suitable down to 16nm, while double patterning extended optical lithography for cuts to the 10-12nm nodes. Design optimization avoided the need for triple patterning. Lines can be patterned with 193nm immersion with no complex OPC. The final line dimensions can be achieved by applying pitch division by two or four.[5]\nIn this study, we extend the scaling using simplified OPC to the 7nm node for critical FEOL and BEOL layers. The test block is a reasonably complex logic function with ~100k gates of combinatorial logic and flip-flops, scaled from previous experiments.\nSimulation results show that for cuts at 7nm logic dimensions, the gate layer can be done with single patterning whose minimum pitch is 53nm, possibly some of the 1x metal layers can be done with double patterning whose minimum pitch is 53nm, and the contact layer will require triple patterning whose minimum pitch is 68nm. These pitches are less than the resolution limit of ArF NA=1.35 (72nm). However these patterns can be separated by a combination of innovative SMO for less than optical resolution limit and a process trick of hole-repair technique. An example of triple patterning coloring is shown in Fig 3. Fin and local interconnect are created by lines and trims. The number of trim patterns are 3 times (min. pitch=90nm) and twice (min. pitch=120nm), respectively. The small number of masks, large pitches, and simple patterns of trims come from the simple 1D layout design.\nExperimental demonstration of these cut layers using design optimization, OPC-Lite, and conventional illuminators at the 7nm node dimensions will be presented. Lines were patterned with 193nm immersion with no complex OPC. The final line dimensions (22nm pitch) were achieved with pitch division 4.[5]", "Traditionally, the optical proximity correction (OPC) is to deliver the solution to ensure the nominal after-development-inspection (ADI) contours on target. As the technology node keeps shrinking to 28nm and beyond, the OPC is expected to cover the lithography process window (PW), etch PW, and overlay margin as well. As a result, more and more advanced functions are included in OPC to achieve the awareness of multiple cost functions, such as the nominal EPE, PW effective EPE, the enclosure of above and underneath layers, and so on. These inclusions are at the cost of the run time and complexity of OPC solution. In this paper, we demonstrated a methodology by adopting design rule check (DRC) algorithm in repair flow to fix hot spots. In accordance to OPC verification check, the subsequent DRC movements were applied to those hot spots only. With a straightforward recipe tuning, a fast convergence of OPC can be achieved. The results exhibit the run time improvement without compromising the OPC performance. We further evaluated by real cases the effects of the DRC-based repair algorithm on the error convergence and final repair effects, by comparing to the standard OPC solution.", "The optical proximity correction (OPC) designs a biased mask so as to ensure the after-development-inspection (ADI) contours could be on target. Meanwhile, the lithographic manufacture process is approaching the sub 28 nm technology node, imposing a tremendous challenge on OPC engineers. Even a well-tuned OPC recipe can render many off-target simulated contours for the most up-to-date chip designs; and these off-target contours indicate highly possible on wafer weak points. We have recently developed a high-performance repair flow that can automatically correct these OPC weak points based on the retargeting procedure. It is expected that one has to take both nominal and process window (PW) conditions into account to avoid potential on wafer weak points. For the contact holes, we require the nominal CD and PW CD be at least CDnom and CDpw, respectively. In some cases, it could be difficult to satisfy both nominal and PW CD constraints which may pose conflicts to each other. In this work, various strategies have been used to accommodate such conflicts; for instance, one can release the nominal constraint or replace the PW CD constrain by the PW area constrain. We perform a systematic study on the various specifications of these constraints, in order to select the most optimal setup for the nominal and PW constraints. These optimized specifications may allow us to perform a highly efficient repair on a contact layer.", "As the technology node shrinks, ArF Immersion reaches the limitation of wafer patterning, furthermore weak point during the mask processing is generated easily. In order to make strong patterning result, the design house conducts lithography rule checking (LRC). Despite LRC processing, we found the weak point at the verification stage of optical proximity correction (OPC). It is called the hot spot point (HSP). In order to fix the HSP, many studies have been performed. One of the most general hot spot fixing (HSF) methods is that the modification bias which consists of \u201cLine-Resizing\u201d and \u201cSpace-Resizing\u201d. In addition to the general rule biasing method, resolution enhancement techniques (RET) which includes the inverse lithography technology (ILT) and model based assist feature (MBAF) have been adapted to remove the hot spot and to maximize the process window. If HSP is found during OPC verification stage, various HSF methods can be applied. However, HSF process added on regular OPC procedure makes OPC turn-around time (TAT) increased.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new HSF method that is able to make OPC TAT shorter than the common HSF method. The new HSF method consists of two concepts. The first one is that OPC target point is controlled to fix HSP. Here, the target point should be moved to optimum position at where the edge placement error (EPE) can be 0 at critical points. Many parameters such as a model accuracy or an OPC recipe become the cause of larger EPE. The second one includes controlling of model offset error through target point adjustment. Figure 1 shows the case EPE is not 0. It means that the simulation contour was not targeted well after OPC process. On the other hand, Figure 2 shows the target point is moved -2.5nm by using target point control function. As a result, simulation contour is matched to the original layout. This function can be powerfully adapted to OPC procedure of memory and logic devices.", "In optical proximity correction (OPC), the sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF) has been used to enhance the process window of main structures. However, the printing of SRAF on wafer is undesirable as this may adversely degrade the overall process yield if it is transferred into the final pattern. A reasonably accurate prediction model is needed during OPC to ensure that the SRAF placement and size have no risk of SRAF printing. Current common practice in OPC is either using the main OPC model or model threshold adjustment (MTA) solution to predict the SRAF printing. This paper studies the feasibility of SRAF printing prediction using logistic regression (LR). Logistic regression is a probabilistic classification model that gives discrete binary outputs after receiving sufficient input variables from SRAF printing conditions. In the application of SRAF printing prediction, the binary outputs can be treated as 1 for SRAFPrinting and 0 for No-SRAF-Printing. The experimental work was performed using a 20nm line/space process layer. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of SRAF printing prediction using LR approach outperforms MTA solution. Overall error rate of as low as calibration 2% and verification 5% was achieved by LR approach compared to calibration 6% and verification 15% for MTA solution. In addition, the performance of LR approach was found to be relatively independent and consistent across different resist image planes compared to MTA solution.", "Precise and fast computation of aerial images are essential. Typical lithographic simulators employ a K\u00f6hler illumination system for which aerial imagery is obtained using a large number of Transmission Cross Coefficients (TCCs). These are generally computed by a slow numerical evaluation of a double integral. We review the general framework in which the 2D imagery is solved and then propose a fast and accurate method to obtain the TCCs. We acquire analytical solutions and thus avoid the complexity-accuracy trade-off encountered with numerical integration. Compared to other analytical integration methods, the one presented is faster, more general and more tractable.", "Correlation of resist modeling of printed features with lithographic data is a necessary part of developing new lithographic processes. Recently, we have found a case in which the most advanced resist types sometimes show better behavior than expectations from optical simulation in terms of dose latitude, MEEF (mask error enhancement factor), and even CD variation through different pitches. This superior resist performance may allow greater margin for error in each component, such as mask, scanner, and metrology in very low-k1 lithography.\nOn the other hand, since the resist pattern CD for the most advanced resist is very much different from the prediction of optical simulation, it is a challenge to build OPC models using the exposure result with the resist. In order to solve this issue, we have tried to use several litho parameters to reduce the gap between optical simulation and resist CDs for OPC modeling. In this paper we discuss the effect of the parameters to reduce the gap between optical model and actual resist behavior with keeping superior performance as much as possible. The method we mention may be a key to use the most advanced resist in near future. As a result the life of ArF immersion lithography in the critical layer would be extended than we expect today.", "Production lithography is undergoing a technology shift, and the requirements of beam delivery system (BDS) are increasing which also raises the precision requirements of the beam steering units (BSU) in BDS. In essence, the BSU is a two rotational degree of freedom platform. In this paper, a BSU based on 3-RPS flexure parallel mechanism is proposed. By analyzing the relationship between the unit\u2019s dimensions and mechanics, a mathematical model is built. Then the BSU with a balance between lower stress of the flexure hinges and higher accuracy of the unit can be got by optimizing the dimensions with the mathematical model. Finally a simulation is conducted to verify the design.", "The need for repeatable, reliable, and faster DUV ArF light source gas optimizations drove the development of Automated Gas Optimization (AGO). These automate the manual gas optimization procedure previously used to select the laser chamber gas pressures and in addition, bandwidth actuation settings, to deliver consistent performance and long gas lives, while maintaining stability and bounds on laser inputs. Manual gas optimization procedure requires at least two refills and an on-site visit by service personnel that can take over an hour to complete. This results in inconsistent light source performance, and sometimes unscheduled downtime. The key to AGO technology is the real-time estimation and monitoring of the laser\u2019s gas and bandwidth states, and automatic adjustment of gas pressure and bandwidth actuators until the states reach their specified targets, thus creating a closed loop. AGO executes on every refill, typically complete in less than 5 minutes, and collect performance data to allow long-term trending. They include built-in safety features and flexibility to allow future upgrades of light source features or performance tuning. Deployed in many lasers in the field, AGO has proved to be a dependable automation, yielding repeatable, fast, and reliable optimizations and valuable long-term trending data used to assess chamber performance", "As chipmakers continue to reduce feature sizes and shrink CDs on the wafer to meet customer needs, Cymer continues developing light sources that enable advanced lithography, and introducing innovations to improve productivity, wafer yield, and cost of ownership. In particular, the ETC controller provides improved spectral bandwidth and wavelength stability, which enables superior CD control and wafer yield for the chipmaker. This controller is a key technology in Cymer\u2019s XLR 700ix and DynaPulseTM products. Last year we reported that the XLR 600ix incorporates new controller technology called ETC for improvements in spectral bandwidth and wavelength stability. The Authors will present metrics demonstrating the performance and stability of systems that have been installed at chipmaker sites over the last year.", "Chipmakers continued pressure to drive down costs while increasing utilization requires development in all areas. Cymer\u2019s commitment to meeting customer\u2019s needs includes developing solutions that enable higher productivity as well as lowering cost of lightsource operation. Improvements in system power efficiency and predictability were deployed to chipmakers\u2019 in 2014 with release of our latest Master Oscillating gas chamber. In addition, Cymer has committed to reduced gas usage, completing development in methods to reduce Helium gas usage while maintaining superior bandwidth and wavelength stability. The latest developments in lowering cost of operations are paired with our advanced ETC controller in Cymer\u2019s XLR 700ix product.", "In semiconductor lithography, light sources play a significant role in the wafer production process as well as impacting the manufacturing cost per wafer. Chip manufacturers going forward will be challenged to develop new ways to become more cost effective than their competitors, and the software tools necessary to compete in this environment must be capable of effectively adapting to the unique needs of each manufacturer. Gigaphoton has developed a new highly customizable software system for managing light sources. It not only offers a simple and intuitive user interface that can be operated using a standard web browser on PCs, tablets, and smartphones, but also a platform for users and third parties to develop unique extensions and optimizations.", "Semiconductor manufacturing industry has growing concerns over future environmental impacts as fabs expand and new generations of equipment become more powerful. Especially rare gases supply and price are one of prime concerns for operation of high volume manufacturing (HVM) fabs. Over the past year it has come to our attention that Helium and Neon gas supplies could be unstable and become a threat to HVM fabs. To address these concerns, Gigaphoton has implemented various green technologies under its EcoPhoton program. One of the initiatives is GigaTwin deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography laser design which enables highly efficient and stable operation. Under this design laser systems run with 50% less electric energy and gas consumption compared to conventional laser designs. In 2014 we have developed two technologies to further reduce electric energy and gas efficiency. The electric energy reduction technology is called eGRYCOS (enhanced Gigaphoton Recycled Chamber Operation System), and it reduces electric energy by 15% without compromising any of laser performances. eGRYCOS system has a sophisticated gas flow design so that we can reduce cross-flow-fan rotation speed. The gas reduction technology is called eTGM (enhanced Total gas Manager) and it improves gas management system optimizing the gas injection and exhaust amount based on laser performances, resulting in 50% gas savings. The next steps in our roadmap technologies are indicated and we call for potential partners to work with us based on OPEN INNOVATION concept to successfully develop faster and better solutions in all possible areas where green innovation may exist.", "Achieving lithographic printability at advanced nodes (14nm and beyond) can impose significant restrictions on physical design, including large numbers of complex design rule checks (DRC) and compute-intensive detailed process model checking. Early identifying of yield-limiter hotspots is essential for both foundries and designers to significantly improve process maturity. A real challenge is to scan the design space to identify hotspots, and decide the proper course of action regarding each hotspot. Building a scored pattern library with real candidates for hotspots for both foundries and designers is of great value. Foundries are looking for the most used patterns to optimize their technology for and identify patterns that should be forbidden, while designers are looking for the patterns that are sensitive to their neighboring context to perform lithographic simulation with their context to decide if they are hotspots or not.[1] In this paper we propose a framework to data mine designs to obtain set of representative patterns of each design, our aim is to sample the designs at locations that can be potential yield limiting. Though our aim is to keep the total number of patterns as small as possible to limit the complexity, still the designer is free to generate layouts results in several million of patterns that define the whole design space. In order to handle the large number of patterns that represent the design building block constructs, we need to prioritize the patterns according to their importance. The proposed pattern classification methodology depends on giving scores to each pattern according to the severity of hotspots they cause, the probability of their presence in the design and the likelihood of causing a hotspot. The paper also shows how the scoring scheme helps foundries to optimize their master pattern libraries and priorities their efforts in 14nm technology and beyond. Moreover, the paper demonstrates how the hotspot scoring helps in improving the runtime of lithographic simulation verification by identifying which patterns need to be optimized to correctly describe candidate hotspots, so that only potential problematic patterns are simulated.", "A pattern-based methodology for optimizing stitches is developed based on identifying stitch topologies and replacing them with pre-characterized fixing solutions in decomposed layouts. A topology-based library of stitches with predetermined fixing solutions is built. A pattern-based engine searches for matching topologies in the decomposed layouts. When a match is found, the engine opportunistically replaces the predetermined fixing solution: only a design rule check error-free replacement is preserved. The methodology is demonstrated on a 20nm layout design that contains over 67 million, first metal layer stitches. Results show that a small library containing 3 stitch topologies improves the stitch area regularity by 4x.", "Starting from the 45nm technology node, systematic defectivity has a significant impact on device yield loss with each new technology node. The effort required to achieve patterning maturity with zero yield detractor is also significantly increasing with technology nodes. Within the manufacturing environment, new in-line wafer inspection methods have been developed to identify device systematic defects, including the process window qualification (PWQ) methodology used to characterize process robustness. Although patterning is characterized with PWQ methodology, some questions remain: How can we demonstrate that the measured process window is large enough to avoid design-based defects which will impact the device yield? Can we monitor the systematic yield loss on nominal wafers? From device test engineering point of view, systematic yield detractors are expected to be identified by Automated Test Pattern Generator (ATPG) test results diagnostics performed after electrical wafer sort (EWS). Test diagnostics can identify failed nets or cells causing systematic yield loss [1],[2]. Convergence from device failed nets and cells to failed manufacturing design pattern are usually based on assumptions that should be confirmed by an electrical failure analysis (EFA). However, many EFA investigations are required before the design pattern failures are found, and thus design pattern failure identification was costly in time and resources. With this situation, an opportunity to share knowledge exists between device test engineering and manufacturing environments to help with device yield improvement. This paper presents a new yield diagnostics flow dedicated to correlation of critical design patterns detected within manufacturing environment, with the observed device yield loss. The results obtained with this new flow on a 28nm technology device are described, with the defects of interest and the device yield impact for each design pattern. The EFA done to validate the design pattern to yield correlation are also presented, including physical cross sections. Finally, the application of this new flow for systematic design pattern yield monitoring, compared to classic inline wafer inspection methods, is discussed.", "Early identification of problematic patterns in real designs is of great value as the lithographic simulation tools face significant timing challenges. To reduce the processing time such a tool selects only a fraction of possible patterns,which have a probable area of failure, with the risk of missing some problematic patterns. In this paper, we introduce a fast method to automatically extract patterns based on their structure and context, using the Voronoi diagram of VLSI design shapes. We first identify possible problematic locations, represented as gauge centers, and then use the derived locations to extract windows and problematic patterns from the design layout. The problematic locations are prioritized by the shape and proximity information of design polygons. We performed experiments for pattern selection in a portion of a 22nm random logic design layout. The design layout had 38584 design polygons (consisting of 199946 line-segments) on layer Mx, and 7079 markers generated by an Optical Rule Checker (ORC) tool. We verified our approach by comparing the coverage of our extracted patterns to the ORC generated markers.", "Multiple patterning (triple and quadruple patterning) is being considered for use on the Middle-Of-Line (MOL) layers at the 10nm technology node and beyond.1 For robust standard cell design, designers need to improve the inter-cell compatibility for all combinations of cells and cell placements. Multiple patterning colorability checks break the locality of traditional rule checking and N-wise checks are strongly needed to verify the multiple patterning colorability for layout interaction across cell boundaries. In this work, a systematic framework is proposed to evaluate the library-level robustness over multiple patterning from two perpectives, including illegal cell combinations and full chip interactions. With efficient N-wise checks, the vertical and horizontal boundary checks are explored to predict illegal cell combinations. For full chip interactions, random benchmarks are generated by cell shifting and tested to evaluate the placement-level efforts needed to reduce the quadruple patterning to triple patterning for the MOL layer.", "Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) will be one of the leading candidates for sub-14nm node and beyond. However, compared with triple patterning, making a feasible standard cell placement has following problems. (1) When coloring conflicts occur between two adjoining cells, they may not be solved easily since SAQP layout has stronger coloring constraints. (2) SAQP layout cannot use stitch to solve coloring conflict. In this paper, we present a framework of SAQP-aware standard cell placement considering the above problems. When standard cell is placed, the proposed method tries to solve coloring conflicts between two cells by exchanging two of three colors. If some conflicts remain between adjoining cells, dummy space will be inserted to keep coloring constraints of SAQP. We show some examples to confirm effectiveness of the proposed framework. To our best knowledge, this is the first framework of SAQP-aware standard cell placement.", "This work addresses the difficulties in creating a manufacturable M2 layer based on an SADP process for N10/N7 and proposes a couple of solutions. For the N10 design, we opted for a line staggering approach in which each line-end ends on a contact. We highlight the challenges to obtain a reasonable process window, both in simulation as on based on exposures on wafer. The main challenges come from a very complex keep mask, consisting of complicated 2D structures which are very challenging for 193i litho. Therefore, we propose a solution in which we perform a traditional LELE process on top of a mandrel layer. Towards N7 we show that a line staggering approach starts to break down and design needs to allow better process window for lithography by having metal lines ending in an aligned fashion. has many challenges and we propose to switch to a line cut approach. A more lithography friendly approach is needed for design where the lines end at aligned points so that the process window can be enhanced.", "As the technology continues to shrink below 14nm, triple patterning lithography (TPT) is a worthwhile lithography methodology for printing dense layers such as Metal1. However, this increases the complexity of standard cell design, as it is very difficult to develop a TPT compliant layout without compromising on the area. Hence, this emphasizes the importance to have an accurate stitch generation methodology to meet the standard cell area requirement as defined by the technology shrink factor. In this paper, we present an efficient auto TPT stitch guidance generation technique for optimized standard cell design. The basic idea here is to first identify the conflicting polygons based on the Fix Guidance [1] solution developed by Synopsys. Fix Guidance is a reduced sub-graph containing minimum set of edges along with the connecting polygons; by eliminating these edges in a design 3-color conflicts can be resolved. Once the conflicting polygons are identified using this method, they are categorized into four types [2] - (Type 1 to 4). The categorization is based on number of interactions a polygon has with the coloring links and the triangle loops of fix guidance. For each type a certain criteria for keep-out region is defined, based on which the final stitch guidance locations are generated. This technique provides various possible stitch locations to the user and helps the user to select the best stitch location considering both design flexibility (max. pin access/small area) and process-preferences. Based on this technique, a standard cell library for place and route (P and R) can be developed with colorless data and a stitch marker defined by designer using our proposed method. After P and R, the full chip (block) would contain the colorless data and standard cell stitch markers only. These stitch markers are considered as \u201cmust be stitch\u201d candidates. Hence during full chip decomposition it is not required to generate and select the stitch markers again for the complete data; therefore, the proposed method reduces the decomposition time significantly.", "LELECUT type triple patterning lithography is one of the most promising techniques in the next generation lithography. To prevent yield loss caused by overlay error, LELECUT mask assignment which is tolerant to overlay error is desired. In this paper, we propose a method that obtains an LELECUT assignment which is tolerant to overlay error. The proposed method uses positive semide_nite relaxation and randomized rounding technique. In our method, the cost function that takes the length of boundary of features determined by the cut mask into account is introduced.", "At 7nm and beyond, designers need to support scaling by identifying the most optimal patterning schemes for their designs. Moreover, designers can actively help by exploring scaling options that do not necessarily require aggressive pitch scaling. In this paper we will illustrate how MOL scheme and patterning can be optimized to achieve a dense SRAM cell; how optimizing device performance can lead to smaller standard cells; how the metal interconnect stack needs to be adjusted for unidirectional metals and how a vertical transistor can shift design paradigms. This paper demonstrates that scaling has become a joint design-technology co-optimization effort between process technology and design specialists, that expands beyond just patterning enabled dimensional scaling.", "As the industry pushes to ever more complex illumination schemes to increase resolution for next generation memory and logic circuits, sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF) placement requirements become increasingly severe. Therefore device manufacturers are evaluating improvements in SRAF placement algorithms which do not sacrifice main feature (MF) patterning capability. There are known-well several methods to generate SRAF such as Rule based Assist Features (RBAF), Model Based Assist Features (MBAF) and Hybrid Assisted Features combining features of the different algorithms using both RBAF and MBAF. Rule Based Assist Features (RBAF) continue to be deployed, even with the availability of Model Based Assist Features (MBAF) and Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT). Certainly for the 3x nm node, and even at the 2x nm nodes and lower, RBAF is used because it demands less run time and provides better consistency. Since RBAF is needed now and in the future, what is also needed is a faster method to create the AF rule tables. The current method typically involves making masks and printing wafers that contain several experiments, varying the main feature configurations, AF configurations, dose conditions, and defocus conditions \u2013 this is a time consuming and expensive process. In addition, as the technology node shrinks, wafer process changes and source shape redesigns occur more frequently, escalating the cost of rule table creation. Furthermore, as the demand on process margin escalates, there is a greater need for multiple rule tables: each tailored to a specific set of main-feature configurations. Model Assisted Rule Tables(MART) creates a set of test patterns, and evaluates the simulated CD at nominal conditions, defocused conditions and off-dose conditions. It also uses lithographic simulation to evaluate the likelihood of AF printing. It then analyzes the simulation data to automatically create AF rule tables. It means that analysis results display the cost of different AF configurations as the space grows between a pair of main features. In summary, model based rule tables method is able to make it much easier to create rule tables, leading to faster rule-table creation and a lower barrier to the creation of more rule tables.", "While waiting for EUV lithography to become ready for adoption, we need to create designs compatible with both EUV single exposures as well as with 193i multiple splits strategy for technology nodes 7nm and below needed to keep the scaling trend intact. However, the standard approach of designing standard cells in two-dimensional directions is no more valid owing to insufficient resolution of 193-i scanner. Therefore, we propose a standard cell design methodology, which exploits purely one-dimensional interconnect.", "Advanced process nodes introduce new variability effects due to increased density, new material, new device structures, and so forth. This creates more and stronger Layout Dependent effects (LDE), especially below 28nm. These effects such as WPE (Well Proximity Effect), PSE (Poly Spacing Effect) change the carrier mobility and threshold voltage and therefore make the device performances, such as Vth and Idsat, extremely layout dependent. In traditional flows, the impact of these changes can only be simulated after the block has been fully laid out, the design is LVS and DRC clean. It\u2019s too late in the design cycle and it increases the number of post-layout iteration. We collaborated to develop a method on an advanced process to embed several LDE sources into a LDE kit. We integrated this LDE kit in custom analog design environment, for LDE analysis at early design stage. These features allow circuit and layout designers to detect the variations caused by LDE, and to fix the weak points caused by LDE. In this paper, we will present this method and how it accelerates design convergence of advanced node custom analog designs by detecting early-on LDE hotspots on partial or fully placed layout, reporting contribution of each LDE component to help identify the root cause of LDE variation, and even providing fixing guidelines on how to modify the layout and to reduce the LDE impact.", "To break through 1-D IC layout limitations, we develop computationally efficient 2-D layout decomposition and stitching techniques which combine the optical and self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP) processes. A polynomial time algorithm is developed to decompose the target layout into two components, each containing one or multiple sets of unidirectional features that can be formed by a SAMP+cut/block process. With no need of connecting vias, the final 2-D features are formed by directly stitching two components together. This novel patterning scheme is considered as a hybrid approach as the SAMP processes offer the capability of density scaling while the stitching process creates 2-D design freedom as well as the multiple-CD/pitch capability. Its technical advantages include significant reduction of via steps and avoiding the interdigitating types of multiple patterning (for density multiplication) to improve the processing yield. The developed decomposition and synthesis algorithms are tested using 2-D layouts from NCSU open cell library. Statistical and computational characteristics of these public layout data are investigated and discussed.", "In-line CD and overlay metrology specifications are typically established by starting with design rules and making certain assumptions about error distributions which might be encountered in manufacturing. Lot disposition criteria in photo metrology (rework or pass to etch) are set assuming worst case assumptions for CD and overlay respectively. For example poly to active overlay specs start with poly endcap design rules and make assumptions about active and poly lot average and across lot CDs, and incorporate general knowledge about poly line end rounding to ensure that leakage current is maintained within specification. There is an opportunity to go beyond generalized guard band design rules to full-chip, design-specific, model-based exploration of worst case layout locations. Such an approach can leverage not only the above mentioned coupling of CD and overlay errors, but can interrogate all layout configurations for both layers to help determine lot-specific, design-specific CD and overlay dispositioning criteria for the fab. Such an approach can elucidate whether for a specific design layout there exist asymmetries in the response to misalignment which might be exploited in manufacturing. This paper will investigate an example of two-layer model-based analysis of CD and overlay errors. It is shown, somewhat non-intuitively, that there can be small preferred misalignment asymmetries which should be respected to protect yield. We will show this relationship for via-metal overlap. We additionally present a new method of displaying edge placement process window variability, akin to traditional CD process window analysis.", "The continuous scaling of semiconductor devices is quickly outpacing the resolution improvements of lithographic exposure tools and processes. This one-sided progression has pushed optical lithography to its limits, resulting in the use of well-known techniques such as Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAF\u2019s), Source-Mask Optimization (SMO), and double-patterning, to name a few. These techniques, belonging to a larger category of Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RET), have extended the resolution capabilities of optical lithography at the cost of increasing mask complexity, and therefore cost. One such technique, called Inverse Lithography Technique (ILT), has attracted much attention for its ability to produce the best possible theoretical mask design. ILT treats the mask design process as an inverse problem, where the known transformation from mask to wafer is carried out backwards using a rigorous mathematical approach. One practical problem in the application of ILT is the resulting contour-like mask shapes that must be \u201cManhattanized\u201d (composed of straight edges and 90-deg corners) in order to produce a manufacturable mask. This conversion process inherently degrades the mask quality as it is a departure from the \u201coptimal mask\u201d represented by the continuously curved shapes produced by ILT. However, simpler masks composed of longer straight edges reduce the mask cost as it lowers the shot count and saves mask writing time during mask fabrication, resulting in a conflict between manufacturability and performance for ILT produced masks1,2. In this study, various commonly used metrics will be combined into an objective function to produce a single number to quantitatively measure a particular ILT solution\u2019s ability to balance mask manufacturability and RET performance. Several metrics that relate to mask manufacturing costs (i.e. mask vertex count, ILT computation runtime) are appropriately weighted against metrics that represent RET capability (i.e. process-variation band, edge-placement-error) in order to reflect the desired practical balance. This well-defined scoring system allows direct comparison of several masks with varying degrees of complexities. Using this method, ILT masks produced with increasing mask constraints will be compared, and it will be demonstrated that using the smallest minimum width for mask shapes does not always produce the optimal solution.", "In the field of model design and selection, there is always a risk that a model is over-fit to the data used to train the model. A model is well suited when it describes the physical system and not the stochastic behavior of the particular data collected. K-fold cross validation is a method to check this potential over-fitting to the data by calibrating with k-number of folds in the data, typically between 4 and 10. Model training is a computationally expensive operation, however, and given a wide choice of candidate models, calibrating each one repeatedly becomes prohibitively time consuming. Akaike information criterion (AIC) is an information-theoretic approach to model selection based on the maximized log-likelihood for a given model that only needs a single calibration per model. It is used in this study to demonstrate model ranking and selection among compact resist modelforms that have various numbers and types of terms to describe photoresist behavior. It is shown that there is a good correspondence of AIC to K-fold cross validation in selecting the best modelform, and it is further shown that over-fitting is, in most cases, not indicated. In modelforms with more than 40 fitting parameters, the size of the calibration data set benefits from additional parameters, statistically validating the model complexity.", "Lithography is a technology to make circuit patterns on a wafer. UV light diffracted by a photomask forms optical images on a photoresist. Then, a photoresist is melt by an amount of exposed UV light exceeding the threshold. The UV light diffracted by a photomask through lens exposes the photoresist on the wafer. Its lightness and darkness generate patterns on the photoresist. As the technology node advances, the feature sizes on photoresist becomes much smaller. Diffracted UV light is dispersed on the wafer, and then exposing photoresists has become more difficult. Exposure source optimization, SO in short, techniques for optimizing illumination shape have been studied. Although exposure source has hundreds of grid-points, all of previous works deal with them one by one. Then they consume too much running time and that increases design time extremely. How to reduce the parameters to be optimized in SO is the key to decrease source optimization time. In this paper, we propose a variation-resilient and high-speed cluster-based exposure source optimization algorithm. We focus on image log slope (ILS) and use it for generating clusters. When an optical image formed by a source shape has a small ILS value at an EPE (Edge placement error) evaluation point, dose/focus variation much affects the EPE values. When an optical image formed by a source shape has a large ILS value at an evaluation point, dose/focus variation less affects the EPE value. In our algorithm, we cluster several grid-points with similar ILS values and reduce the number of parameters to be simultaneously optimized in SO. Our clustering algorithm is composed of two STEPs: In STEP 1, we cluster grid-points into four groups based on ILS values of grid-points at each evaluation point. In STEP 2, we generate super clusters from the clusters generated in STEP 1. We consider a set of grid-points in each cluster to be a single light source element. As a result, we can optimize the SO problem very fast. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm runs speed-up compared to a conventional algorithm with keeping the EPE values.", "In this paper, we develop statistical models to investigate SRAM yield performance and circuit variability in the presence of self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP) process. It is assumed that SRAM fins are fabricated by a positivetone (spacer is line) self-aligned sextuple patterning (SASP) process which accommodates two types of spacers, while gates are fabricated by a more pitch-relaxed self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) process which only allows one type of spacer. A number of possible inverter and SRAM structures are identified and the related circuit multi-modality is studied using the developed failure-probability and yield models. It is shown that SRAM circuit yield is significantly impacted by the multi-modality of fins\u2019 spatial variations in a SRAM cell. The sensitivity of 6-transistor SRAM read/write failure probability to SASP process variations is calculated and the specific circuit type with the highest probability to fail in the reading/writing operation is identified. Our study suggests that the 6-transistor SRAM configuration may not be scalable to 7-nm half pitch and more robust SRAM circuit design needs to be researched.", "The Fin-FET Technology scaling to sub 7nm node, using 193 immersion scanner is restricted due to reduced margins for process. The cost of the process and complexity of designs is increasing due to multi-patterning to achieve area scaling using 193i scanner. In this paper, we propose a two Fin-cut mask design for Fin-pattering of 112 SRAM (two Fins for pull-down and one Fin for pull-up and pass-gate device) cell using 193i lithography and its comparison with EUVL single print. We also propose two keep masks for middle of line patterning ,with increased height of the SRAM cell using 193i, that results in area of a uniform-Fin SRAM cell area at 7nm technology; whereas EUVL can enable non-uniform SRAM cell at reduced area. Due to unidirectional patterning, margins for VIA0 landing over MOL are drastically reduced at 42nm gate pitch and hence to improve margins, the orientation for 1st metal is proposed to be orthogonal to the gate. This results in improved performance for SRAM and reliability of the technology.", "Multi-patterning (MP) is the process of record for many sub-10nm process technologies. The drive to higher densities has required the use of double and triple patterning for several layers; but this increases the cost of the new processes especially for low volume products in which the mask set is a large percentage of the total cost. For that reason there has been a strong incentive to develop technologies like Directed Self Assembly (DSA), EUV or E-beam direct write to reduce the total number of masks needed in a new technology node. Because of the nature of the technology, DSA cylinder graphoepitaxy only allows single-size holes in a single patterning approach. However, by integrating DSA and MP into a hybrid DSA-MP process, it is possible to come up with decomposition approaches that increase the design flexibility, allowing different size holes or bar structures by independently changing the process for every patterning step. A simple approach to integrate multi-patterning with DSA is to perform DSA grouping and MP decomposition in sequence whether it is: grouping-then-decomposition or decomposition-then-grouping; and each of the two sequences has its pros and cons. However, this paper describes why these intuitive approaches do not produce results of acceptable quality from the point of view of design compliance and we highlight the need for custom DSA-aware MP algorithms.", "During the yield ramp of semi-conductor manufacturing, data is gathered on specific design-related process window limiters, or yield detractors, through a combination of test structures, failure analysis, and model-based printability simulations. Case-by-case, this data is translated into design for manufacturability (DFM) checks to restrict design usage of problematic constructs. This case-by-case approach is inherently reactive: DFM solutions are created in response to known manufacturing marginalities as they are identified. In this paper, we propose an alternative, yet complementary approach. Using design-only topological pattern analysis, all possible layout constructs of a particular type appearing in a design are categorized. For example, all possible ways via forms a connection with the metal above it may be categorized. The frequency of occurrence of each category indicates the importance of that category for yield. Categories may be split into sub-categories to align to specific manufacturing defect mechanisms. Frequency of categories can be compared from product to product, and unexpectedly high frequencies can be highlighted for further monitoring. Each category can be weighted for yield impact, once manufacturing data is available. This methodology is demonstrated on representative layout designs from the 28 nm node. We fully analyze all possible categories and sub-categories of via enclosure such that 100% of all vias are covered. The frequency of specific categories is compared across multiple designs. The 10 most frequent via enclosure categories cover \u226590% of all the vias in all designs. KL divergence is used to compare the frequency distribution of categories between products. Outlier categories with unexpected high frequency are found in some designs, indicating the need to monitor such categories for potential impact on yield.", "Semiconductor manufacturing technologies are becoming increasingly complex with every passing node. Newer technology nodes are pushing the limits of optical lithography and requiring multiple exposures with exotic material stacks for each critical layer. All of this added complexity usually amounts to further restrictions in what can be designed. Furthermore, the designs must be checked against all these restrictions in verification and sign-off stages. Design rules are intended to capture all the manufacturing limitations such that yield can be maximized for any given design adhering to all the rules. Most manufacturing steps employ some sort of model based simulation which characterizes the behavior of each step. The lithography models play a very big part of the overall yield and design restrictions in patterning. However, lithography models are not practical to run during design creation due to their slow and prohibitive run times. Furthermore, the models are not usually given to foundry customers because of the confidential and sensitive nature of every foundry's processes. The design layout locations where a model flags unacceptable simulated results can be used to define pattern rules which can be shared with customers. With advanced technology nodes we see a large growth of pattern based rules. This is due to the fact that pattern matching is very fast and the rules themselves can be very complex to describe in a standard DRC language. Therefore, the patterns are left as either pattern layout clips or abstracted into pattern-like syntax which a pattern matcher can use directly. The patterns themselves can be multi-layered with \"fuzzy\" designations such that groups of similar patterns can be found using one description. The pattern matcher is often integrated with a DRC tool such that verification and signoff can be done in one step. The patterns can be layout constructs that are \"forbidden\", \"waived\", or simply low-yielding in nature. The patterns can also contain remedies built in so that fixing happens either automatically or in a guided manner. Building a comprehensive library of patterns is a very difficult task especially when a new technology node is being developed or the process keeps changing. The main dilemma is not having enough representative layouts to use for model simulation where pattern locations can be marked and extracted. This paper will present an automatic pattern library creation flow by using a few known yield detractor patterns to systematically expand the pattern library and generate optimized patterns. We will also look at the specific fixing hints in terms of edge movements, additive, or subtractive changes needed during optimization. Optimization will be shown for both the digital physical implementation and custom design methods.", "Under the low-k1 lithography process, lithography hotspot detection and elimination in the physical verification phase have become much more important for reducing the process optimization cost and improving manufacturing yield. This paper proposes a highly accurate and low-false-alarm hotspot detection framework. To define an appropriate and simplified layout feature for classification model training, we propose a novel feature space evaluation index. Furthermore, by applying a robust classifier based on the probability distribution function of layout features, our framework can achieve very high accuracy and almost zero false alarm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in that our detector outperforms other works in the 2012 ICCAD contest in terms of both accuracy and false alarm.", "Pattern based design rule checks have emerged as an alternative to the traditional rule based design rule checks in the VLSI verification flow [1]. Typically, the design-process weak-points, also referred as design hotspots, are classified into patterns of fixed size. The size of the pattern defines the radius of influence for the process. These fixed sized patterns are used to search and detect process weak points in new designs without running computationally expensive process simulations. However, both the complexity of the pattern and different kinds of physical processes affect the radii of influence. Therefore, there is a need to determine the optimal pattern radius (size) for efficient hotspot detection. The methodology described here uses a combination of pattern classification and pattern search techniques to create a directed graph, referred to as the Pattern Association Tree (PAT). The pattern association tree is then filtered based on the relevance, sensitivity and context area of each pattern node. The critical patterns are identified by traversing the tree and ranking the patterns. This method has plausible applications in various areas such as process characterization, physical design verification and physical design optimization. Our initial experiments in the area of physical design verification confirm that a pattern deck with the radius optimized for each pattern is significantly more accurate at predicting design hotspots when compared to a conventional deck of fixed sized patterns.", "Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) is the essential process for planarization of wafer surface in semiconductor manufacturing. CMP process helps to produce smaller ICs with more electronic circuits improving chip speed and performance. CMP also helps to increase throughput and yield, which results in reduction of IC manufacturer\u2019s total production costs. CMP simulation model will help to early predict CMP manufacturing hotspots and minimize the CMP and CMP induced Lithography and Etch defects [2]. In the advanced process nodes, conventional dummy fill insertion for uniform density is not able to address all the CMP short-range, long-range, multi-layer stacking and other effects like pad conditioning, slurry selectivity, etc. In this paper, we present the flow for 20nm CMP modeling using Mentor Graphics CMP modeling tools to build a multilayer Cu-CMP model and study hotspots. We present the inputs required for good CMP model calibration, challenges faced with metrology collections and techniques to optimize the wafer cost. We showcase the CMP model validation results and the model applications to predict multilayer topography accumulation affects for hotspot detection. We provide the flow for early detection of CMP hotspots with Calibre CMPAnalyzer to improve Design-for-Manufacturability (DFM) robustness.", "DFM rule based scoring is associated with manufacturability rules checking and applying the scoring to predict the yield entitlement for an IC chip design. Achieving high DFM score is one of the key requirements to get high yield. The DFM scoring methodology is currently limited to DFM recommend rules and their associated failure rates. In contrast to failure mechanism, chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) step topography variations places an important role to it. In this paper, we present an advanced DFM analysis flow to compute DFM score that incorporate topography variation along with recommend rule scoring using complex scoring model to increase silicon yield correlation.", "In this paper, we present a compact model to predict the pillar-edge-roughness (PER) effects on 3D vertical nanowire MOSFETs using the perturbation method. An analytic solution to 3D Poisson\u2019s equation in the cylindrical coordinate with a perturbed boundary is obtained to describe the PER effects on the vertical channel potential. The induced variations of drain current, threshold voltage (Vth), and sub-threshold slope (SS) are calculated using the developed model. We also investigate the PER phase and frequency dependent behavior of the nanowire MOSFETs, and find that both phase and (angular) frequency of the PER function will significantly affect the device performance. Our model calculation results are compared with TCAD simulations and a good agreement between them is found. It is suggested that our metrology society needs to develop relevant measurement methodology to characterize the nanowire pillar-edge roughness at deep nanoscale.", "As technology development advances into deep submicron nodes, it is very important not to ignore any systematic effect that can impact CD uniformity and the final parametric yield. One important challenge for OPC is in choosing the proper etch process correction flow to compensate for design-to-design etch shrink variations. Although model-based etch compensation tools have been commercially available for a few years now, rules-based etch compensation tables have been the standard practice for several nodes. In our work, we study the limitations of the rules-based etch compensation versus model-based etch compensation. We study a 10nm process and provide the details of why using Model-Based Etch Process Correction can achieve up to 15% improvement in final CD uniformity. We also provide a systematic methodology for identifying the proper etch correction technique for a given etch process and assessing the potential accuracy gain when switching to the model-based etch correction.", "As the IC industry moves forward to advanced nodes, especially under 28nm technology, the printability issue is becoming more and more challenging because layouts are more congested with a smaller critical feature size and the manufacturing process window is tighter. Consequently, design-process co-optimization plays an important role in achieving a higher yield in a shorter tape-out time. A great effort has to be made to analyze the process defects and build checking kits to deliver the manufacturing information, by utilizing EDA software, to designers to dig out the potential manufacturing issues and quickly identify hotspots and prioritize how to fix them according to the severity levels. This paper presents a unique hotspot pattern analysis flow that SMIC has built for advanced technology to analyze the potential yield detractor patterns in millions of patterns from real designs and rank them with severity levels related to real fab process. The flow uses Mentor Graphics Calibre\u00ae PM (Calibre\u00ae Pattern Matching) technology for pattern library creation and pattern clustering; meanwhile it incorporates Calibre\u00ae LFD (Calibre\u00ae Litho-Friendly Design) technology for accurate simulation-based lithographic hotspot checking. Pattern building, clustering, scoring, ranking and fixing are introduced in detail in this paper.", "Early in a semiconductor node\u2019s process development cycle, the technology definition is locked down using somewhat risky assumptions on what the process can deliver once it matures. In this early phase of the development cycle, detailed design rules start to be codified while the wafer patterning process is still being fine-tuned. As the process moves along the development cycle, and wafer processes are dialed-in, key yield improvement efforts focus on variability reduction. Design retargeting definitions are tweaked and finalized, and the use of finely tuned etch models to compensate for process bias are applied to accurately capture the more mature wafer process. The resulting mature patterning process is quite different from the one developed during the early stages of the technology definition. In this paper we describe an approach and flow to drive continuous improvement in the mask solution (OPC and MBSRAF) later in the process development and production readiness cycle stage. First, we establish the process window entitlement within the design-space by utilizing advanced mask optimization (MO) combined with the baseline process (i.e., model, etch compensation, and design retargeting). Second, gaps to the entitlement are used to identify and target issues with the existing OPC recipe and to drive continuous improvements to close these performance gaps across the critical design rules. We demonstrate this flow on a 20 nm contact layer.", "Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) becomes more important with every new technology node. Complex patterning issues can no longer wait to be detected experimentally using test sites because of compressed technology development schedules. Simulation must be used to discover complex interactions between an iteration of the design rules, and a simultaneous iteration of an intended patterning technology. The problem is often further complicated by an incomplete definition of the patterning space. The DTCO process must be efficient and thoroughly interrogate the legal design space for a technology to be successful. In this paper we present our view of DTCO, called Design and Patterning Exploration. Three emphasis areas are identified and explained with examples: Technology Definition, Technology Learning, and Technology Refinement. The Design and Patterning Exploration flows are applied to a logic 1.3x metal routing layer. Using these flows, yield limiting patterns are identified faster using random layout generation, and can be ruled out or tracked using a database of problem patterns. At the same time, a pattern no longer in the set of rules should not be considered during OPC tuning. The OPC recipe may then be adjusted for better performance on the legal set of pattern constructs. The entire system is dynamic, and users must be able to access related teams output for faster more accurate understanding of design and patterning interactions. In the discussed example, the design rules and OPC recipe are tuned at the same time, leading to faster design rule revisions, as well as improved patterning through more customized OPC and RET.", "Delivering mask ready OPC corrected data to the mask shop on-time is critical for a foundry to meet the cycle time commitment for a new product. With current OPC compute resource sharing technology, different job scheduling algorithms are possible, such as, priority based resource allocation and fair share resource allocation. In order to maximize computer cluster efficiency, minimize the cost of the data processing and deliver data on schedule, the trade-offs of each scheduling algorithm need to be understood. Using actual production jobs, each of the scheduling algorithms will be tested in a production tape-out environment. Each scheduling algorithm will be judged on its ability to deliver data on schedule and the trade-offs associated with each method will be analyzed. It is now possible to introduce advance scheduling algorithms to the OPC data processing environment to meet the goals of on-time delivery of mask ready OPC data while maximizing efficiency and reducing cost.", "Traditional physical design verification tools employ a deck of known design rules, each of which has a pre-defined pass/fail criteria associated with it. While passing a design rule deck is a necessary condition for a VLSI design to be manufacturable, it is not sufficient. Other physical design profiling decks that attempt to obtain statistical information about the various critical dimensions in the VLSI design lack a systematic methodology for rule enumeration. These decks are often inadequate, unable to extract all the interlayer and intralayer dimensions in a design that have a correlation with process yield. The Physical Design Analyzer is a comprehensive design analysis tool built with the objective of exhaustively exploring design-process correlations to increase the wafer yield.", "Starting with the sub 2Xnm node, the process window becomes smaller and tighter than before. Pattern related error budget is required for accurate critical-dimension control of Cell layers. Therefore, lithography has been faced with its various difficulties, such as weird distribution, overlay error, patterning difficulty etc. The distribution of cell pattern and overlay management are the most important factors in DRAM field. We had been experiencing that the fatal risk is caused by the patterns located in the tail of the distribution. The overlay also induces the various defect sources and misalignment issues. Even though we knew that these elements are important, we could not classify the defect type of Cell patterns. Because there is no way to gather massive small pattern CD samples in cell unit block and to compare layout with cell patterns by the CD-SEM. The CD- SEM is used in order to gather these data through high resolution, but CD-SEM takes long time to inspect and extract data because it measures the small FOV. (Field Of View) However, the NGR(E-beam tool) provides high speed with large FOV and high resolution. Also, it\u2019s possible to measure an accurate overlay between the target layout and cell patterns because they provide DBM. (Design Based Metrology) By using massive measured data, we extract the result that it is persuasive by applying the various analysis techniques, as cell distribution and defects, the pattern overlay error correction etc. We introduce how to correct cell pattern, by using the DBM measurement, and new analysis methods.", "In this paper, a stitch database is built from various identified stitching structures in an open-cell layout library. The corresponding stitching yield models are developed for the hybrid optical and self-aligned multiple patterning (hybrid SAMP). Based on the concept of probability-of-success (POS) function, we first develop a single-stitching yield model to quantify the effects of overlay errors and cut-hole CD variations. The overhang distance designed in a stitching process (or its mean value \u03bc) is found to be critical to the stitching yield performance and can be optimized using this yield model. We also investigate the physical significance of several process parameters such as half pitch (HP), standard deviation (\u03c3) of the random overhang distribution, and cut-hole CD (CL). Our study shows that certain types of stitching yield are sensitive to \u03c3 and HP, while in general high yield can be achieved for a large number of stitching types we examined. To improve the yield of certain challenging stitching structures, various layout modification strategies are proposed and discussed.", "This paper presents an automated DFM solution to generate Bit Line Pattern Dummy (BLPD) for memory chips. Dummy shapes are aligned with memory functional bits lines to ensure uniform and reliable memory device. This paper will present a smarter approach that uses an analysis based technique for adding the dummy fill shapes that have different types according to the space available. Experimental results based on layout of a memory test chip.", "Relentless scaling of advanced integrated devices drives feature dimensions towards values which can be expressed in small multiples of the lattice spacing of silicon. One of the consequences of dealing with features on such an atomic scale is that surface properties start to play an increasingly important role. To encompass both dimensional as well as compositional and structural control, we introduce the term \u201catomic scale fidelity.\u201d In this paper, we will discuss the challenges as well as new solutions to achieve atomic scale fidelity for patterning etch processes. Fidelity of critical dimensions (CD) across the wafer is improved by means of the Hydra Uniformity System. Wafer, chip and feature level atomic scale fidelity such as etch rate uniformity, aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) /1/, selectivity and surface damage can be addressed with emerging atomic layer etching (ALE) approaches /2/.", "As feature critical dimension (CD) shrinks towards and beyond the 7nm node, patterning techniques for optical lithography with double and triple exposure will be replaced by EUV patterning. EUV enables process and overlay improvement, as well as a potential cost reduction due to fewer wafer passes and masks required for patterning. However, the EUV lithography technique introduces newer types of resists that are thinner and softer compared to conventional 193nm resists currently being used. The main challenge is to find the key etch process parameters to improve the EUV resist selectivity, reduce LER and LWR, minimize line end shrink, improve tip-to-tip degradation, and avoid line wiggling while still enabling previous schemes such as trench-first-metal-hard-mask (TFMHM), self-aligned via (SAV) and self-aligned contact (SAC).\nIn this paper, we will discuss some of the approaches that we have investigated to define the best etch process adjustments to enable EUV patterning. RF pulsing is one of the key parameters utilized to overcome most of the previously described challenges, and has also been coupled with stack optimization. This study will focus on RF pulsing (high vs. low frequency results) and bias control (RF frequency dependence). In particular, pulsing effects on resist morphology, selectivity and profile management will be reported, as well as the role of aspect ratio and etch chemistry on organic mask wiggling and collapse.\nThis work was performed by the Research Alliance Teams at various IBM Research and Development Facilities.", "We report a 20 nm half-pitch self-aligned double patterning (SADPP) process based on a resist-core approach. Line/space 20/20 nm features in silicon are successfully obtained with CDvariation, LWR and LER of 0.7 nm, 2.4 nm and 2.3 nm respectively. The LWR and LER are characterized at each technological step of the process using a power spectral density fitting method, which allows a spectral analysis of the roughness and the determination of unbiased roughness values. Although the SADP concept generates two asymmetric populations of lines, the final LLWR and LER are similar. We show that this SADP process allows to decrease significantly the LWR and the LER of about 62% and 48% compared to the initial photoresist patterns. This study also demonstrates that SADP is a very powerful concept to decrease CD uniformity and LWR especially in its low-frequency components to reach sub-20 nm node requirements. However, LER low-frequency components are still high and remain a key issue tot address for an optimized integration.", "Optical lithography has given the semiconductor industry the chance to follow Moore\u2019s law in scaling the transistor dimensions and consequently stacking them in a more dense way. However, for present sub 20 nm nanoscale patterns, which are reaching molecular dimensions; controlling the line edge and width roughness (LER/LWR) has become a key challenge. One way of reducing the roughness at photoresist level is the exposure of the organic substrate to a hydrogen plasma process in a post lithography step. Unfortunately, to this day, no clear understanding of the interaction of various plasma parameters with EUV resist substrates has been reported. In this work, two EUV resist platforms were exposed to an H2 plasma environment and H2 energetic neutrals only, by using a customized plasma reactor. The surface and bulk modifications of the photoresists have been evaluated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) of Block Copolymers (BCP) is one of the most promising solutions for sub-10 nm nodes. However, some challenges need to be addressed for a complete adoption of DSA in manufacturing such as achieving DSA-friendly design, low defectivity and accurate pattern placement. In this paper, we propose to discuss the DSA integration flows using graphoepitaxy for contact-hole patterning application. DSA process dependence on guiding pattern density has been studied and solved thanks to a new approach called \u201cDSA planarization\u201d. The capabilities of this new approach have been evaluated in terms of defectivity, Critical Dimension (CD) control and uniformity before and after DSA etching transfer.", "Patterning at 10 nm and sub-10 nm technology nodes is one of the key challenges for the semiconductor industry. Several patterning techniques are under investigation to enable the aggressive pitch requirements demanded by the logic technologies. EUV based patterning is being considered as a serious candidate for the sub-10nm nodes. As has been widely published, a new technology like EUV has its share of challenges. One of the main concerns with EUV resists is that it tends to have a lower etch selectivity and worse LER/LWR than traditional 193nm resists. Consequently the characteristics of the dry etching process play an increasingly important role in defining the outcome of the patterning process.\nIn this paper, we will demonstrate the role of the dual-frequency Capacitively Coupled Plasma (CCP) in the EUV patterning process with regards to improving LER/LWR, resist selectivity and CD tunability for holes and line patterns. One of the key knobs utilized here to improve LER and LWR, involves superimposing a negative DC voltage in RF plasma at one of the electrodes. The emission of ballistic electrons, in concert with the plasma chemistry, has shown to improve LER and LWR. Results from this study along with traditional plasma curing methods will be presented. In addition to this challenge, it is important to understand the parameters needed to influence CD tunability and improve resist selectivity. Data will be presented from a systematic study that shows the role of various plasma etch parameters that influence the key patterning metrics of CD, resist selectivity and LER/LWR. This work was performed by the Research Alliance Teams at various IBM Research and Development Facilities.", "Patterning the desired narrow pitch at 10nm technology node and beyond, necessitates employment of either extreme ultra violet (EUV) lithography or multi-patterning solutions based on 193nm-immersion lithography. With enormous challenges being faced in getting EUV lithography ready for production, multi-patterning solutions that leverage the already installed base of 193nm-immersion-lithography are poised to become the industry norm for 10 and 7nm technology nodes. For patterning sub-40nm pitch line/space features, self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) with resist pattern as the first mandrel shows significant cost as well as design benefit, as compared to EUV lithography or other multi-patterning techniques. One of the most critical steps in this patterning scheme is the resist mandrel definition step which involves trimming / reformation of resist profile via plasma etch for achieving appropriate pitch after the final pattern. Being the first mandrel, the requirements for the Line Edge Roughness (LER) / Line Width Roughness (LWR); critical dimension uniformity (CDU); and profile in 3-dimensions for the resist trim / reformation etch is extremely aggressive.\nIn this paper we highlight the unique challenges associated in developing resist trim / reformation plasma etch process for SAQP integration scheme and summarize our efforts in optimizing the trim etch chemistries, process steps and plasma etch parameters for meeting the mandrel definition targets. Finally, we have shown successful patterning of 30nm pitch patterns via the resist-mandrel SAQP scheme and its implementation for Si-fin formation at 7nm node.", "One of most promising technique for the extension of 193nm immersion lithography must be Self-Aligned Multiple Patterning (SAMP) at the present. We have studied this SAMP in several aspects, which are scaling capability, mitigation of process complexity, pattern fidelity, affordability and so on. On the other hand, Gridded Design Rule (GDR) concept with Single directional layout (1D layout) extended the down-scaling with 193-immersion furthermore and relieve the process variation and process complexity, represented in Optical proximity effect (OPE), by simplification of layout design. In 1D layout fabrication, Key process steps might be edge placement control on grating line and controllability of hole-shrink technique for line-cutting. This paper introduces current demonstration results on pattern transfer fidelity control and hole-shrink technique as combined with unique pattern shape repair approach.", "For more than five decades, the semiconductor industry has overcome technology challenges with innovative ideas that have continued to enable Moore\u2019s Law. It is clear that multi-patterning lithography is vital for 20nm half pitch using 193i. Multi-patterning exposure sequences and pattern multiplication processes can create complicated tolerance accounting due to the variability associated with the component processes. It is essential to ensure good predictive accuracy of compact etch models used in multipatterning simulation. New modelforms have been developed to account for etch bias behavior at 20 nm and below. The new modeling components show good results in terms of global fitness and some improved predication capability for specific features. We\u2019ve also investigated a new methodology to make the etch model aware of 3D resist profiles.", "The performance of novel molecular glass resists is demonstrated in this work for the purposes of performing nano-pattern transfer. In order to improve the etch durability, post apply bake (PAB) and mixing two resists platforms were investigated. These resists showed a promising etch durability for efficient pattern transfer with films as thin as 5 nm. Etch rate, surface roughness, evolution of the refractive index of these materials are presented to establish a good baseline and select appropriate candidate materials for patterning beyond-CMOS.", "A neutral beam etching process has been developed that achieves damage- free (chemically and physically) etching. Recently, it was found that transition metals could be etched using neutral beam etching through metallic complex reactions. In this process, a neutral beam is extracted from a plasma generation region into a reaction chamber. Complex reactant gases are injected into a reaction chamber which is screened from the plasma during neutral beam etching. In this paper, etching of Pt and CoFeB, candidate materials for MRAM structures by a neutral beam system is described. It was found that etch rate enhancement of Pt/CoFeB surfaces resulted from their exposure to a neutral beam from Ar/O2 plasma with simultaneous injection of EtOH /acetic acid into the reaction chamber. Etching damage was also evaluated and no magnetic hysteresis degradation has been observed. Neutral beam etching technology has the capability to make breakthrough for fabricating MRAM device.", "With shrinking critical dimensions, minimizing each of aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE), bowing, undercut, selectivity, and within die uniformly across a wafer is met by trading off one requirement against another. The problem of trade-offs is especially critical. At the root of the problem is that roles radical flux, ion flux and ion energy play may be both good and bad. Increasing one parameter helps meeting one requirement but hinders meeting the other. Managing process by managing flux ratios and ion energy alone with conventional sources is not adequate because surface chemistry is uncontrollable. At the root of lack of control is that the electron energy distribution function (eedf) has not been controlled. Fortunately the high density surface wave sources control the eedf by fiat. High density surface wave sources are characterized by distinct plasma regions: an active plasma generation region with high electron temperature (Te) and an ionization free but chemistry rich diffusive region (low Te region). Pressure aids is segregating the regions by proving a means for momentum relaxation between the source and downstream region. \u201cSpatial pulsing\u201d allows access to plasma chemistry with reasonably high ion flux, from the active plasma generation region, just above the wafer. Low plasma potential enables precise passivation of surfaces which is critical for atomic layer etch (ALE) or high precision etch where the roles of plasma species can be limited to their purposed roles. High precision etch need not be at the cost of speed and manufacturability. Large ion flux at precisely controlled ion energy with RLSATM realizes fast desorption steps for ALE without compromising process throughput and precision.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) is one of the promising candidates for next-generation lithography. We developed a novel simple sub-15 nm line-and-space (L/S) patterning process, the \u201ccoordinated line epitaxy (COOL) process,\u201d using grapho- and chemo-hybrid epitaxy. In this study we evaluate the DSA L/S pattern transfer margin. Since defect reduction is difficult in the case of the DSA pattern transfer process, there is a need to increase the pattern transfer margin. We also describe process integration for electrical yield verification.", "We report a facile route to form densely packed graphene nanoribbon (GNR) arrays via graphoepitaxial assembly of symmetric P(S-b-MMA). Since guiding channels for graphoepitaxy are the source and drain electrodes in field effect transistor (FET) geometry, we avoid laborious nanopatterning and FET device fabrication processes. By grafting a random copolymer brush on the graphene FET device, perpendicular lamellar domains are aligned normal to the electrode direction, resulting in line arrays connecting the two electrodes. Through optimization of the reactive ion etching conditions, the vertically oriented lamellar domains were transferred to the underlying graphene, leading to GNR arrays that act as conducting channels. This is a simple and efficient fabrication process using the fundamental concepts developed for the graphoepitaxial assembly of symmetric BCPs to create densely packed sub- 20 nm GNR arrays, compared to conventional fabrication process.", "Electron beam writing remains one of the reference pattern generation techniques, and plasma etching continues to underpin pattern transfer. We report a systematic study of the plasma etch resistance of several e-beam resists, both negative and positive as well as classical and Chemically Amplified Resists: HSQ[1,2] (Dow Corning), PMMA[3] (Allresist GmbH), AR-P6200 (Allresist GmbH), ZEP520 (Zeon Corporation), CAN028 (TOK), CAP164 (TOK), and an additional pCAR (non-disclosed provider). Their behaviour under plasma exposure to various nano-scale plasma etch chemistries was examined (SF6/C4F8 ICP silicon etch, CHF3/Ar RIE SiO2 etch, Cl2/O2 RIE and ICP chrome etch, and HBr ICP silicon etch). Samples of each resist type were etched simultaneously to provide a direct comparison of their etch resistance. Resist thicknesses (and hence resist erosion rates) were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometer in order to provide the highest accuracy for the resist comparison. Etch selectivities (substrate:mask etch rate ratio) are given, with recommendations for the optimum resist choice for each type of etch chemistry. Silicon etch profiles are also presented, along with the exposure and etch conditions to obtain the most vertical nano-scale pattern transfer. We identify one resist that gave an unusually high selectivity for chlorinated and brominated etches which could enable pattern transfer below 10nm without an additional hard mask. In this case the resist itself acts as a hard mask. We also highlight the differing effects of fluorine and bromine-based Silicon etch chemistries on resist profile evolution and hence etch fidelity.", "It is clear today that further scaling towards smaller dimensions and pitches requires a multitude of additional process steps. Within this work we look for solutions to achieve a middle of line 193i based patterning scheme for N7 logic at a contacted poly pitch of 40-45 nm. At these pitches, trenches can still be printed by means of double patterning. However, they need to be blocked at certain positions because of a limited line end control below 90 nm pitch single print. Based on the 193i patterning abilities, the proposed SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) cell requires 5 blocking layers. Integrating 5 blocking layers is a new challenge since down to N10 one blocking layer was usually sufficient. The difficulty with multiple blocking layers is the removal of the masked parts, especially in cases of overlap. As a solution a novel patterning approach is proposed and tried out on relaxed dimensions (patent pending). The proposed solution is expected not to be sensitive to the number of blocking layers used, and tolerates their overlap. The stack is constructed to be compatible with N7 substrates such as SiGe or P:Si. Experimental results of the stack blocking performance on relaxed pitch will be presented and discussed.", "When CMOS technology reaches 28/20nm node and beyond, several new schemes are implemented such as High K metal gate (HKMG) which can enhance the device performance and has better control of device current leakage. Dummy poly gate removal (DPGR) process is introduced for HKMG, and works as a key process to control the work function of metal gate and threshold voltage (Vt) shift. In dry etch technology, conventional continuous wave (CW) plasma process has been widely used, however, it may not be capable for some challenging process in 28nm node and beyond. In DPGR process for HKMG scheme, CW scheme may result in plasma damage of gate oxide/capping layer for its inherent high electron temperature (Te) and ion energy while synchronous pulsing scheme is capable to simultaneously pulse both source and bias power, which could achieve lower Te, independent control of ion and radical flux, well control the loading of polymer deposition on dense/ isolate features. It\u2019s the first attempt to utilize synchronous pulsing plasma in DPGR process. Experiment results indicate that synchronous pulsing could provide less silicon recess under thin gate oxide which is induced by the plasma oxidation. Furthermore, the loading of HK capping layer loss between long channel and short channel can be well controlled which plays a key role on transistor performance, such as leakage and threshold voltage shift. Additionally, it has been found that synchronous pulsing could distinctly improve ILD loss when compared with CW, which is helpful to broaden the whole process window.", "Based on semiconductor process conditions such as power, gas, temperature and pressure, proper elastomer seal material selection is vital to maximizing the performance and productivity of wafer process production systems. Numerous metrology and test methods are used to measure the combined performance of elastomer seals. It is extremely important to take into consideration several performance parameters because minute shifts or modifications to process conditions can have detrimental effects on the production process. Weight loss, FTIR, SEM, Laser Confocal Microscope, and ICP/MS are some of the test methods used by Greene, Tweed to predict, with high confidence, the performance of elastomer seals for specific process conditions. This methodology is used to support the semiconductor research and process development community.", "The suppression of stochastic effects such as line edge roughness (LER) and stochastic defect generation is required for the realization of high volume production of semiconductor devices with 11 nm critical dimension using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. In this study, the effect of the molecular weight and protection ratio of the resist polymer on LER and stochastic defect generation was investigated. By increasing the molecular weight, LER and the probability for the stochastic defect generation were decreased. The negative effect caused by the increase of molecular weight is the increase of the minimum block size for dissolution in the development process. By increasing the protection ratio, the similar effect was expected. However, LER and the probability for the stochastic defect generation were not significantly decreased by increasing the protection ratio because of the decrease of quantum efficiency of acid generation caused by the protection of proton sources. The development of protecting group that does not affect the quantum efficiency is essential to decrease the stochastic effects.", "We have shown that the dissolution properties can be successfully modified to improve the line/space profile and LWR of a low diffusion EUV CA resist. The surface roughness is a function of hot spots in the nominally unexposed regions of the resist material. We conjecture that the photoacid hot spots are formed due to DC flare present in the optical train of the exposure system. We also have shown that the PAGs can be further improved for out-of-band radiation (OOB) response. The improvement can be as much as 557% for 193nm exposure, and 838% by 248nm exposure. The improved OOB response leads to better contact hole performance. We also shared our continued improvement in resist witness plate performance with the majority of our resists passing for carbon growth, and all samples passing for non-cleanables. There does appear to be a site-to-site bias which we attribute to differences between e-beam and EUV exposure and/or substrate working distance from the source. Lastly, we show outstanding lithographic process window for 24 nm contact arrays on an NXE 3300 stepper as well as 15 nm half pitch lines and spaces on the PSI interferometric tool.", "Recently in the R&D area DRAM has shrunk to 1X nm, at the same time patterning technology has been one of the major challenges on 1X nm DRAM. Less than 20nm line and space and less than 30nm contact hole patterning are basically needed for 1X nm DRAM. Currently ArF immersion extension such as DPT (Double Patterning Technology), SADP (Self-Aligned Double Patterning) and SAQP (Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning) shows robust patterning performance relative to EUV/DSA and become established process as a baseline for 1Xnm DRAM. But cost of ownership and process complexity of DPT/SADP can be the big burden for volume production. Furthermore too many DPT/SADP can make DRAM shrink meaningless. In spite of current issues on DPT/SADP, EUV source power has been the most critical issue so far. And now source power issue is pushing development of high sensitive EUV resist and related process. In this paper, author will compare EUV PTD and NTD in view of image contrast and swelling, also evaluate patterning performance between EUV PTD and NTD, and finally describe current status and issues of EUV NTD.", "EUV stochastic effects are generally studied [1-7] from the point of view of Line-Edge-Roughness (LER), Line-Width-Roughness (LWR), Local CDU (LCDU), i.e. from the point of view of the CD-Variability of the printed patterns. In this paper we will look at what happens when this variability gets worse and turns into (random) locally failing patterns, such as missing contacts or locally closed trenches. In doing so, these failures contribute to setting the effective printability limit for the experimental conditions and the type of structures that are being considered. We will first discuss the way in which we have tried to quantify the amount of locally failing structures, i.e. the metrics we have adopted to describe them. Next we describe how the amount of locally failing structures depends on some pattern-related and experimental condition-related parameters. From this we concluded that \u2013 as in the case of local variability \u2013 the amount of local failure depends on the exposure dose used (the well-known photon shot noise effects) as well as on mechanisms that originate in the resist or the process. Although we have not been able to identify what this resist- or materials component is exactly, we do have some indications that point to the development step, but we will also discuss other potential contributors.", "Experimental local CD uniformity (LCDU) of the dense contact-hole (CH) array pattern is statistically decomposed into stochastic noise, mask component, and metrology factor. Each component are compared quantitatively, and traced after etching to find how much improvement can be achieved by smoothing. Etch CDU gain factor is defined as the differential of etch CD by resist CD, and used to estimate etch CDU on resist CDU. Stochastic noise has influenced on not only LCDU but also local placement error (LPE) of each contact-hole. This LPE is also decomposed into its constituents in the same statistical way. As a result, stochastic noise is found to be the most dominant factor on LCDU and LPE. Etch LCDU is well expected by Etch Gain factor, but LPE seems to be kept same after etching. Fingerprints are derived from the repeating component and the boundary size for excluding proximity effect in analysis is investigated.", "Laser produced plasma (LPP) light sources have been developed as the primary approach for EUV scanner imaging of circuit features in sub-20nm devices in high volume manufacturing (HVM). This paper provides a review of development progress and readiness status for the LPP extreme-ultra-violet (EUV) source. We present the latest performance results from second generation sources, including Prepulse operation for high power, collector protection for long lifetime and low cost of ownership, and dose stability for high yield. Increased EUV power is provided by a more powerful drive laser and the use of Prepulse operation for higher conversion efficiciency. Advanced automation and controls have been developed to provide the power and energy stability performance required during production fab operation. We will also discuss lifetesting of the collector in Prepulse mode and show the ability of the debris mitigation systems to keep the collector multi-layer coating free from damage and maintain high reflectivity.", "Since 2002, we have been developing a CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source, the most promising solution as the 13.5 nm high power (>200 W) light source for HVM EUV lithography. Because of its high efficiency, power scalability and spatial freedom around plasma. Our group has proposed several unique original technologies; 1) CO2 laser driven Sn plasma generation, 2) Double laser pulse shooting for higher Sn ionization rate and higher CE. 3) Sn debris mitigation with a magnetic field, 4) Hybrid CO2 laser system that is scalable with a combination of a short pulse oscillator and commercial cw-CO2 amplifiers. 5) High efficient out of band light reduction with grating structured C1 mirror. In past paper we demonstrated in small size (2Hz) experimental device, this experiment shoed the advantage of combining a laser beam at a wavelength of the CO2 laser system with Sn plasma to achieve high CE>4.7% (in maximum) from driver laser pulse energy to EUV in-band energy 1). In this paper we report the further updated results from last paper. (1) 20um droplets at 100kHz operation was successfully ejected by downsized nozzle and demonstrated dramatical improvement of debris on the collector mirror. We have been developing extension of high CE operation condition at 20kHz range, We have reported component technology progress of EUV light source system. (2)New generation collector mirror with IR reduction technology is equipped in mirror maker. (3)20kW CO2 laser amplifier system is demonstrated cooperate with Mitsubishi electric. (4) We develop new Proto #2 EUV LPP source system and demonstrated 200W EUV plasma power (43W EUV clean power at I/F ) at 100kHz operation was confirmed. (5) High conversion efficiency (CE) of 3.9% at 20kHz operation was confirmed in using pico-second pre-pulse laser. (6)Improvement of CO2 laser power from 8kW to 12kW is now on going by installation of new pre-amplifier. (7)Power-up scenario of HVM source is reported, target shipment of first customer beta LPP light source unit is 2015.", "In this paper, we provide a detailed review of development of a highly-efficient high-power nanosecond pulse CO2 laser using transverse-flow radio-frequency (RF)-exited laser amplifiers, which is for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source of a next generation of nano-lithography. High-density excited high-power transverse-flow CO2 lasers were designed and built for the application of laser produced plasma (LPP) EUV source. We carried out an amplification test of the transverse-flow CO2 laser seeded by a nanosecond pulse CO2 laser. A four-amplifier system generated an average output power of 21 kW with an electrical input power of 400 kW for discharges. The electrical-to-optical efficiency was 5.2%. The input pulse laser had an average power of 46 W, the repetition rate was 100 kHz, and the pulse duration was 15 ns. The transverse-flow CO2 laser has strong points in high gain and availability of the multi-fold optical path. A highly-efficient amplification was experimentally proved characterized by transverse-flow CO2 laser amplifiers even with low-power seed. A transverse-flow CO2 laser is a promising candidate for an amplifier in the LPP EUV light source.", "Plasma based radiation sources optimized to emit 13.5 nm Extreme UV radiation also produce a significant amount of light at longer wavelengths. This so called out-of-band (OoB) radiation is detrimental for the imaging capabilities of an EUV lithographic imaging system, particularly the ultraviolet (UV) parts of the light (\u03bb=100-400 nm). To suppress these wavelengths while maintaining the high efficiency of the mirror for EUV light, several methods have been developed, including phase-shift gratings (PsG) and anti-reflection layers (SPE layer). Both methods have achieved a suppression factor of 10 - 30 around the target wavelength. To achieve a full band suppression effect with a minimum loss of EUV light, a new scheme based on surface pyramid structures was developed. An average suppression of more than 10 times was achieved with a relative EUV efficiency of 82.2% by using the Si pyramids structure (compared to a flat multilayer (ML)). Recently, we have successfully produced a pyramid structure consisting of multilayers which greatly improves the relative EUV efficiency to 94.2%.", "For full commercialization, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology requires the availability of EUV mask blanks that are free of defects. This remains one of the main impediments to the implementation of EUV at the 22 nm node and beyond. Consensus is building that a few small defects can be mitigated during mask patterning, but defects over 100 nm (SiO2 equivalent) in size are considered potential \u201ckiller\u201d defects or defects large enough that the mask blank would not be usable. The current defect performance of the ion beam sputter deposition (IBD) tool will be discussed and the progress achieved to date in the reduction of large size defects will be summarized, including a description of the main sources of defects and their composition.", "EUV mask blank substrates will be subject to extraordinarily demanding requirements upon flatness, smoothness and absence of residual defects. To date, no combination of available surface preparation techniques has been able to produce essentially perfect substrates with zero residual defect populations. A critical problem yet to be resolved involves small numbers of nanoscale divots and scratches which are generated by the operations used to meet smoothness requirements. A new non-contact surface sputtering technique known as accelerated neutral atom beam (ANAB) shows promise for mitigating the divot and scratch defects without increasing surface roughness and without altering flatness and planarity. This paper describes a mask blank substrate study which has been conducted to demonstrate the ANAB defect mitigation capability.", "In EUV Lithography, an absence of promising candidate of EUV pellicle demands new requirements of EUV mask cleaning which satisfy the cleaning durability and removal efficiency of the various contaminations from accumulated EUV exposure. It is known that the cleaning with UV radiation is effective method of variety of contaminants from surface, while it reduces durability of Ru capping layer. To meet the expectation of EUV mask lifetime, it is essential to understand the mechanism of Ru damage. In this paper, we investigate dominant source of Ru damage using cleaning method with UV radiation. Based on the mechanism, we investigate several candidates of capping to increase the tolerance from the cycled UV cleaning. In addition, we study durability difference depending on the deposition method of Ru capping. From these studies, it enables to suggest proper capping material, stack and cleaning process.", "Multiple challenges, including the availability of a reliable high power source, defect free mask, and proper resist material, have forced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography to be considered for sub-10 nm half-pitch nodes. Therefore, techniques such as phase shift masks (PSMs) or high numerical aperture (NA) lithography might be considered. Such techniques require thin EUV absorber materials to be optimized to reduce EUV mask shadowing effects. Despite the challenges in dry etching of Ni and finding proper chemistries with a high etch selectivity to suitable capping materials, we decided to examine the chemical stability of Ni for existing mask cleaning chemistries. Ni, after Ag, has the highest absorption in EUV light at \u03bb = 13.5 nm, which makes it a proper candidate\u2014in pure form or in mixing with other elements\u2014for thin absorber film. Depending on the composition of the final material, proper integration schemes will be developed. We studied Ni stability in commonly used mask cleaning processes based on ammonium hydroxide/ hydrogen peroxide (APM) and water mixtures. Ni films deposited with an ion beam deposition technique with a thickness of 35 nm are sufficient to totally absorb EUV light at \u03bb = 13.5 nm. Multiple cleanings of these Ni films resulted in Ni oxidation\u2014 confirmed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) analysis as NiO with thickness about 1.5 nm. Furthermore, Ni oxidation processes are self-limiting and oxide layer thickness did not increase with a further cleaning. A three minute exposure to sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM) can remove NiO and Ni totally. To protect Ni film from etching by SPM chemistry a 3 nm Si capping was used on top of Ni film. However, Si capping was removed by APM chemistry and could not protect Ni film against SPM chemistry. TiO2 may be a very good capping layer for EUV optics but it is not suitable for EUV mask blanks and will be removed by APM chemistries.", "One critical area for EUV lithography is the development of appropriate mask repair strategies. To this end, we have explored etching repair strategies for nickel absorber layers and focused electron beam induced deposition of ruthenium capping layers. Nickel has higher EUV absorption than the standard TaN absorber layer and thus thinner films and improved optical quality can be realized. A thin (2.5 nm) ruthenium film is commonly used as a protective capping layer on the Mo-Si EUV multi-layer mirror which mechanically and chemically protects the multi-layers during standard mask-making procedures. The gas field ion (GFIS) microscope was used to investigate helium and neon ion beam induced etching (IBIE) of nickel as a candidate technique for EUV lithography mask editing. No discernable nickel etching was observed for helium, however transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed subsurface damage to the underlying Mo-Si multilayers. Subsequently, neon beam induced etching at 30 keV was investigated and successfully removed the 50 nm nickel absorber film. TEM imaging also revealed subsurface damage in the underlying Mo-Si multilayer. Two damage regimes were apparent, namely: 1) beam induced mixing of the Mo-Si layers and 2) nanobubble formation. Monte Carlo simulations were performed and the observed damage regimes were correlated to: 1) the nuclear energy loss and 2) a critical implant concentration. Electron beam induced deposition (EBID) was explored to deposit ruthenium capping/protective layers. Several ruthenium precursors were screened and so far liquid bis(ethylcyclopentyldienyl)ruthenium(II) was successful. The purity of the as-deposited nanodeposits was estimated to be 10% Ru and 90% C. We demonstrate a new chemically assisted electron beam purification process to remove carbon by-products and show that high-fidelity nanoscale ruthenium repairs can be realized.", "The force of adhesion of 50 nm diameter diamond-like carbon sphere probes to three quartz substrates was measured using an atomic force microscope. The force of adhesion was measured prior to cleaning, within 10 minutes after cleaning, after storage in an N2-purged cabinet, and after storage in an N2-purged vacuum oven. The evaluated cleaning recipes were SC1-like, SPM-like, and HF-based, each followed by ultra-pure deionized water (UPW) rinse and spin drying. The measurements were conducted in a Class 100 clean room at approximately 50% relative humidity. In addition, contact angle measurements were made on three additional quartz substrates using UPW before cleaning, after cleaning, and throughout N2 storage. The adhesion force increased after cleaning as compared to the pre-cleaned state, continued to increase until reaching a maximum after 5 days of N2 storage, and then decreased after 26 days for all three substrates. One substrate was then stored in a vacuum oven for 3 days, and the adhesion force decreased to 46% of the pre-cleaned state. The contact angle was reduced from over 30\u00b0 before cleaning to 0\u00b0 immediately after cleaning. During subsequent N2 storage, the contact angle increased to 5\u00b0 or greater after 18 hours for the substrate cleaned with the HF-based recipe and after 15 days for the substrates cleaned by the SC1-like and SPM-like recipes.", "In our previous work, various techniques were used to confirm the contamination deposits on the sidewall of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask absorbers [1-2]. In order to further understand the effects of contamination topography on mask absorbing features, direct measurements of contaminated features is needed. In this work, we investigated the contamination topography using cross-section transmission electron microscope (TEM) image analysis on four different masks. TEM specimens of contaminated features from silicon and ruthenium capped EUV masks were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB). We conducted the contamination experiment with three different exposure sources including EUV, out-of-band, and electron induced processes. Thickness measurements from each contamination experiment were provided. Shadowing effect and geometric analysis on the contamination topography is also discussed.", "Particle contamination in ultra-pure water (UPW) and chemicals will eventually end up on the surface of a wafer and may result in killer defects. To improve the semiconductor processing yield in sub-10 nm half pitch nodes, it is necessary to control particle defectivity. In a systematic study of all major techniques for particle detection, counting, and sizing in solutions, we have shown that there is a gap in the required particle metrology which needs to be addressed by the industry. To reduce particles in solutions and improve filter retention for sub-10 nm particles with very low densities (<10 particles/mL), liquid particle counters that are able to detect small particles at low densities are required. Non-volatile residues in chemicals and UPW can result in nanoparticles. Measuring absolute non-volatile residues in UPW with concentrations in the ppb range is a challenge. However, by using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of non-volatile residues we found silica both in dissolved and colloidal particle form which is present in one of the cleanest UPW that we tested. A particle capture/release technique was developed at SEMATECH which is able to collect particles from UPW and release them in a controlled manner. Using this system we showed sub-10 nm particles are present in UPW. In addition to colloidal silica, agglomerated carbon containing particles were also found in UPW.", "In this paper we introduce new source-mask co-optimization (SMO) capabilities for EUV with specific support of the details of imaging with NXE:33\u00d70 scanners. New algorithms have been developed that fully exploit the adjustability of the light distribution inside the NXE:33\u00d70 flexible illuminator, FlexPupil. The fast NXE M3D+ model accurately predicts the reflective 3D mask effects and enables novel pupil symmetries and mask defocus optimization. This mitigates the H-V bias, Bossung tilt, and pattern shift caused by shadowing and non-telecentricity, and reduces the sensitivity to flare. New pupil optimization flows will be shown. The optimized pupils are fully compliant with NXE:33\u00d70 scanner specifications. We will demonstrate enhanced imaging performance of this NXE specific SMO on 7 nm node logic cut masks and show benefits up to 20% improved CD uniformity, and a reduction in the maximum pattern shifts.", "EUV lithography (EUVL) is the most promising technology to extend the resolution limit, and is expected to be used if the enough source power is delivered and mask defect mitigation method is developed. However, even in that case, the number of EUV steps will be restricted by its high cost, and ArF immersion will still take a major role in the chip manufacturing. Therefore, it is important to check and improve the mix-match overlay (MMO) between EUV and ArF immersion steps. In this paper, we evaluate EUV MMO with ArF immersion system by comparing with dedicated chuck overlay (DCO). The major contributors on MMO are random and field component from overlay analysis. MMO is expected to be below 3nm by applying 18para CPETM(correction per exposure) and RegCTM(Registraion error correction). We consider High oder CPETM need to be developed for further improvement.", "Though scaling of source power is still the biggest challenge in EUV lithography (EUVL) technology era, CD and overlay controls for transistor\u201fs requirement are also precondition of adopting EUVL in mass production. Two kinds of contributors are identified as risks for CDU and Overlay: Infrared (IR) and deep ultraviolet (DUV) out of band (OOB) radiations from laser produced plasma (LPP) EUV source. IR from plasma generating CO2 laser that causes optics heating and wafer overlay error is well suppressed by introducing grating on collector to diffract IR off the optical axis and is the effect has been confirmed by operation of pre-production tool (NXE3100). EUV and DUV OOB which are reflected from mask black boarder (BB) are root causes of EUV-specific CD error at the boundaries of exposed shots which would result in the problem of CDU out of spec unless sufficiently suppressed. Therefore, control of DUV OOB reflection from the mask BB is one of the key technologies that must be developed prior to EUV mass production. In this paper, quantitative assessment on the advantage and the disadvantage of potential OOB solutions will be discussed. EUV and DUV OOB impacts on wafer CDs are measured from NXE3100 & NXE3300 experiments. Significant increase of DUV OOB impact on CD from NXE3300 compared with NXE3100 is observed. There are three ways of technology being developed to suppress DUV OOB: spectral purity filter (SPF) as a scanner solution, multi-layer etching as a solution on mask, and resist top-coating as a process solution. PROs and CONs of on-scanner, on-mask, and on-resist solution for the mass production of EUV lithography will be discussed.", "As EUV Lithography (EUVL) continues to evolve, it offers a possible solution to the problems of additional masks and lithography steps that drive up the cost and complexity of 193i multiple patterning. EUVL requires a non-telecentric reflective optical system for operation. This requirement causes EUV specific effects such as shadowing. The absorber physically shadows the reflective multilayer (ML) on an EUV reticle resulting in pattern fidelity degradation. To reduce this degradation, a thinner absorber may help. Yet, as the absorber thickness decreases, reflectivity increases in the \u2018dark\u2019 region around the image field, resulting in a loss of contrast. The region around the edge of the die on the mask of unpatterned absorber material deposited on top of ML, known as the image border, is also susceptible to undesirable reflections in an ideally dark region. For EUVL to be enabled for high-volume manufacturing (HVM), reticle masking (REMA) blades are used to shield light from the image border to allow for the printing of densely spaced die. When die are printed densely, the image border of each neighboring die will overlap with the edge of a given die resulting in an increase of dose that overexposes features at the edge of the field. This effect is convolved with a fingerprint from the edge of the REMA blades. This phenomenon will be referred to as a field edge effect. One such mitigation strategy that has been investigated to reduce the field edge effect is to fully remove the ML along the image border to ensure that no actinic-EUV radiation can be reflected onto neighboring die. This has proven to suppress the effect, but residual out-of-band radiation still provides additional dose to features near the image border, especially in the corners where three neighboring fields overlap. Measurements of dense contact holes (CHs) have been made along the image border with and without a ML-etched border at IMEC in collaboration with Micron using the ASML NXE:3100. The implementation of these measurements allow for further mitigation, i.e., compensation by OPC. Mentor Graphics\u2019 Calibre software uses the scanner\u2019s point spread function and convolves it with the mask layout to generate a flare map. It also has the capability to add additional dose to the image border which can be optimized to fit the experimental data. This includes the transition region between the image field and border that results in a linear rolloff of dose due to partial shadowing of the REMA blades. By applying this flaremap that accounts for neighboring die to the already calibrated optical and resist models, OPC can now be enabled to compensate for field edge effects. This study has two goals. First, we will show that OPC can be used to compensate both for field edge effects with and without a etched ML border. The second is to investigate the limitations that exist for OPC in the areas altered by neighboring die. This will predict when a process to mitigate the field edge effect is needed to enable EUV HVM.", "Defect avoidance methods are likely to play a key role in overcoming the challenge of mask blank defects in EUV lithography. In this work, we propose a novel EUV mask defect avoidance method. It is the first approach that allows exploring all the degrees of freedom available for defect avoidance (pattern shift, rotation and mask floorplanning). We model the defect avoidance problem as a global, non-convex optimization problem and then solve it using a combination of random walk and gradient descent. For a 8nm polysilicon layer of an ARM Cortex M0 layout, our method achieves 60% point better mask yield compared to prior art in defect avoidance for a 40-defect mask.", "We verify image fidelity after mask 3D aware-OPC (using Mentor Graphics Domain Decomposition Method) and quantify pattern placement error (PPE) on wafer. First we show experimental pattern fidelity improvement of DDM-OPCed 2D-images of logic devices in 10 nm technology node with the latest NXE3300B EUV exposure tool. We then compare pattern fidelity in aerial images after DDM-OPC to aerial images using rigorous simulation of electric and magnetic field. Finally we quantify PPE in resist images with modeled 1D layouts after a perfect OPC. The perfect OPC corrects optical proximity effect, azimuthal angle through slit, and lens aberration. The forecasted PPE residual error after perfect OPC is 0.21 nm (x) and 0.76 nm (y) that can be attributed to uncorrectable components of wafer defocus and mask flatness. For modeling and compensation of pattern placement error, a new metrology method should be developed.", "In this paper we discuss the EUV OPC modeling challenges and potential solutions, as well as OPC integration requirements to support the forthcoming application of EUV lithography. 10-nm-node OPC modeling is considered as an example. Wafer and mask process data were collected for calibration and verification patterns, to understand the mask making error/OPC model interactions. Several factors, including compact mask topography modeling impact, were analyzed by means of rigorous simulations and model fitting. This was performed on a large-scale data set, to ensure accurate characterization of the OPC modeling strategies, using a large number of patterns.", "The EUV mask infrastructure is of key importance for a successful introduction of EUV lithography into volume production. In particular, for the production of defect free masks, actinic review of potential defect sites is required. To realize such an actinic review tool, Zeiss and the SEMATECH EUVL Mask Infrastructure consortium started a development programme for an EUV aerial image metrology system (AIMS\u2122 EUV). In this paper, we discuss the status of the on-going system integration and show first results from the first light tests of the prototype tool.", "The SEMATECH High Numerical Aperture Actinic Reticle Review Project (SHARP) is a synchrotron-based extreme ultraviolet (EUV) microscope dedicated to photomask research. SHARP has been operational and serving users since June, 2013, and in eight months, SHARP has recorded over 71,000 high-resolution images. Exposure times are 5 to 8 seconds, and 8 or more through-focus series can be collected per hour at positions spanning the entire mask surface. SHARP\u2019s lossless coherence-control illuminator and variable numerical aperture (NA) enable researchers to emulate the imaging properties of both current and future EUV lithography tools. SHARP\u2019s performance continues to improve over time due to tool learning and upgraded capabilities, described here. Within a centered, 3-\u03bcm square image region, we demonstrate an illumination power stability above 99%, and an average uniformity of 98.4%. Demonstrations of through-focus imaging with various illumination coherence settings highlight the capabilities of SHARP.", "The framework and the current status of a newly developed PEM pattern inspection system are presented. A die-to-die defect detection sensitivity of the developing system is investigated. A programmed defect mask was used for demonstrating the performance of the system. Defect images were obtained as difference images by comparing PEM images with-defects to the PEM images without-defects. The image-processing system was also developed for die-to-die inspection. A targeted inspection throughput of 19-hour inspection per mask with 16nm pixel size for image capture was attained. Captured image of 28 nm intrusion defect in hp 64 nm L/S pattern was used for detection. The defect is clearly identified by the image processing. But several false defects are also detected. To improve the defect detection sensitivity to reach the targeted level of achieving a higher than 10 S/N value at 16 nm defect size, by applying a higher current density and a developed inspection algorithm adjustment is, currently an on-going program.", "In this paper, we address a new inspection method which provides in-focus inspection capability and higher defect sensitivity compared with conventional mask inspection methods. In the Zernike phase contrast microscope, an added phase shift to background wave combines with the phase of bump and pit defects to achieve higher contrast at focus. If we use a centralized apodization to half the lens radius to further reduce the intensity of the phase-shifted background wave, the signal strength can be improved up to 6-fold of its original value. Simulation results further show that this apodization for a typical EUV mask power spectral density results in the noise decreasing in absolute level similar to the clear field reference signal. Thus large improvements in signal to noise ratios are possible with the Zernike phase contrast microscope type systems for EUV mask inspection applications.", "Publisher's Note: This paper, originally published on April 17, 2014, was withdrawn at the author's request on May 25, 2016.", "EUV Lithography is aimed to be inserted into mainstream production for sub-20nm pattern fabrication. Unlike conventional optical lithography, frequent defectivity monitors (adders, repeaters etc.) are required in EUV lithography. Due to sub-20nm pattern and defect dimensions e-beam inspection of critical pattern areas is essential for yield monitor. In previous work we showed sub-10nm defect detection sensitivity1 on patterned resist wafers. In this work we report 8-10\u00d7 improvement in scan rates of etched patterns compared to resist patterns without loss in defect detection sensitivity. We observed good etch transfer of sub-10nm resist features. A combination of smart scan strategies with improved etched pattern scan rates can further improve throughput of e-beam inspection. An EUV programmed defect mask with Line/Space, Contact patterns was used to evaluate printability of defects and defect detection (Die-Die and Die-Database) capability of the e-beam inspection tool. Defect inspection tool parameters such as averaging, threshold value were varied to assess its detection capability and were compared to previously obtained results on resist patterns.", "High-radiance EUV source is needed for actinic mask inspection applications. LDP source for a lithography application was found to be also able to provide sufficient radiance for mask inspection purpose. Since the plasma size of LDP is properly larger than LPP, not only radiance but also power is suitable for mask inspection applications. Operating condition such as discharge pulse energy, discharge frequency and laser parameter have been tuned to maximize radiance. Introduction of new techniques and several modifications to LDP source have brought radiance level to 180 W/mm2/sr at plasma (or 130 W/mm2/sr as clean-photon radiance). The LDP source is operated at moderate power level in order to ensure sufficient component lifetime and reliability. The first lifetime test done at 10 kHz resulted in 6.5 Gpulse without failure. Debris mitigation system has been successfully installed showing optical transmission as high as 71 %.", "Photon sources for extreme ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) are still facing challenges in required performance for high volume manufacture. Currently EUVL community has focused the research and developments on the dual-pulse laser produced plasma (LPP) devices with mass-limited targets. Such complex systems require extensive optimization to enhance the conversion efficiency (CE) and components lifetime and such optimization requires significant experimental and costly efforts.\nWe continued to enhance our state-of-the art HEIGHTS package to analyze and optimize LPP sources and to make projections and realistic predictions of near future powerful devices. HEIGHTS package includes full 3-D detail description of all integrated physical processes involved in LPP devices. The models continued to be upgraded and well benchmarked in each interaction physics phase of plasma evolution for EUV and BEUV production.\nWe simulated LPP sources using small droplets as the targets and evaluated the requirements for optimization of these sources in dependence on laser wavelength. We also simulated the targets as distributed fragments resulting from the intense pre-pulse laser energy deposition. Additionally, we simulated vapor/plasma mixture created by pre-pulse laser with comparatively low intensity. We studied mass dependence, laser parameters efficiency, optimization of EUV (13.5 nm) and BEUV (6.7 nm) radiation output, and atomic and ionic debris generation to predict potential damage to the optical collection system from energetic debris and the requirements for mitigating systems to reduce debris fluence. Our modeling and simulation included all phases of laser target evolution: from laser/droplet interaction, energy deposition, target vaporization and fragmentation, ionization, plasma hydrodynamic expansion, thermal and radiation energy redistribution, and EUV/BEUV photons collection as well as detail mapping of photons source location and size. Modeling results were benchmarked against recent experimental studies for the in-band photons production and for debris and ions generation for both EUV and BEUV systems.", "The suppression of outgassing from extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resist needs to be addressed for realizing EUV lithography (EUVL) because outgassing is likely the main contributor to the contamination of mirror optics in EUV scanners, which results in reflectivity loss. Resist outgassing causes two types of contamination: cleanable contamination, involving hydrocarbon contaminants, and noncleanable contamination, involving noncarbon components. The relation of cleanable contamination between EUV- and electron beam (EB)-based evaluations is linear. However, the relation of noncleanable contamination is not clear. In this study, we investigated the contribution of EUV resist components to noncleanable contamination using different photoacid generator components. The cleanability of noncleanable elements (sulfur, iodine, chlorine, and bromine) in contamination films was measured and compared for the EUV- and EB-based outgas testers. The result suggested that the chlorine and bromine contaminants were completely removed after cleaning. On the other hand, sulfur and iodine remained even after cleaning. This suggested that the careful use of iodine in resist materials is necessary due to its high photoabsorption and low cleanability. In addition, the cleaning rate and noncleanability of contaminants in the EUV-based test were larger than in the EB-based test. This suggests that the contamination film in the EUV-based test is more porous than that in the EB-based test.", "EUV lithography is a technology enabling next generation electronic devices, but issues with photoresist sensitivity, resolution and line edge roughness as well as tool downtime and throughput remain. As part of the industry's efforts to address these problems we have worked with resist suppliers to quantify the relative contamination rate of a variety of resists on EUV multilayer mirror analogues following ASML approved protocols. Here we present results of our ongoing program to better understand the effect of process parameters such as dose and resist thickness on the contamination rate of ruthenium coated witness plates, additionally we present results from a study on the effectiveness of hydrogen cleaning.", "EUV photoresists are considered as a potential source of optics contamination, since they introduce irradiation-induced outgassing in the EUV vacuum environment. Therefore, before these resists can be used on e.g. ASML NXE:3100 or NXE:3300, they need to be tested in dedicated equipment according to a well-defined procedure, which is based on exposing a witness sample (WS) in the vicinity of a simultaneously exposed resist as it outgasses. Different system infrastructures are used at multiple sites (e.g. NIST, CNSE, Sematech, EIDEC, and imec) and were calibrated to each other by a detailed test plan. Despite this detailed tool qualifications, a first round robin comparison of identical materials showed inconsistent outgas test results, and required further investigation by a second round robin. Since the resist exposure mode is different at the various locations (some sites are using EUV photons while others use E-gun electrons), this difference has always a point of concern for variability of test results. In this work we compare the outgas test results from EUV photon and electron exposure using the resist materials of the second round robin. Since the imec outgas tester allows both exposure methods on the resist, a within-system comparison is possible and showed limited variation between photon and electron exposure mode. Therefore the system-to-system variability amongst the different outgas test sites is expected to be related to other parameters than the electron/photon exposure mode. Initial work showed that the variability might be related to temperature, E-gun emission excursion, and/or residual outgassing scaled by different wafer areas at the different sites.", "Previous investigations on the patterning mechanism of nanoparticle photoresists provided insight into ligand displacement exerting a controlling influence on dissolution behavior of nanoparticles in organic developers. Nanoparticle core-ligand interaction which dictates ligand displacement would ultimately translate to the sensitivity of the photoresist. The current study investigates enhancement of resist sensitivity via altering the core-ligand interaction of the nanoparticle, which further emphasizes our proposed patterning hypothesis.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is a candidate for the manufacturing of semiconductor devices at the 22 nm half pitch node and below. EUV lithography requires high performance resist with limited outgassing property. The key challenge for EUV resist is the simultaneous requirement of ultrahigh resolution (R), low line edge roughness (L) and high sensitivity (S) for lines and spaces (LS) features. To achieve high resist sensitivity EUV resist absorbance should be increased. Resin containing fluorine atom is one of the most attractive methods to improve absorbance level of EUV resist because the fluorine atom absorbs EUV light strongly. However, resist hydrophobicity (or high contact angle) also increase due to presence of fluorine atoms in the resist polymer. It is difficult to rinse high CA resist during development process so the resist containing polymer with fluorine atom may produce additional defects. In this paper, we will report the relationship between line edge roughness and acid diffusion length. We will also show the method to diminish defects caused by high contact angle (CA) resist. We achieved good resolution and LER improvement by controlling acid diffusion length. Moreover, we found the relationship of the number of defects and the structure of the monomers containing fluorine units.", "Polymers with a different Tg and activation energy were prepared to clarify influences of acid diffusion on resolution at 15 nm half-pitch (hp) and 14 nm hp using a EUV micro-field exposure tool (MET) at LBNL. Resolution on such a narrow pattern was limited by collapse and pinching. Clear relationship between pinching numbers and polymer Tg indicates that acid diffusion is one of major contributors on the pinching. In addition, polymers with a low thermal activation energy (Ea) on deprotection were effective for reducing pinching. This is probably originated from its high chemically amplification character even in low post-exposure bake (PEB) temperature to obtain both large chemical contrast and short acid diffusion. On the other hand, a good correlation between a cleanable outgassing amount and Ea indicates trade-off relationship between outgassing and resolution. Advantages of n-butyl acetate (nBA) developer have been investigated in viewpoint of dissolution uniformity. Surface roughness of a non-patterned resist film at half-exposed area, which was well correlated with LWR, was measured by AFM as indicator of uniformity in development process. To avoid any differences in resist chemistry other than development process, cross linking negative tone resist was applied for this study. The surface roughness obtained by nBA, which is conventional negative-tone imaging (NTI) developer, was 32 % lower than that obtained by 2.38 % TMAH solution. NTI resist system with a nBA developer and optimized resist reduced LWR from 4.8 nm to 3.0 nm in comparison with conventional positive tone resist with a 2.38 % TMAH developer. In addition, advantage on semi-dense trench patterning was well defined. New EUV sensitizer with 1.15 times higher EUV absorption resulted in 1.15 times higher acid yield by EUV exposure. Lithography performance of the new EUV sensitizer has been investigated by MET at SEMATECH Albany. Sensitivity was indeed improved from 20 mJ/cm2 to 17 mJ/cm2 according to the acid yield increase, but resolution was significantly degraded.", "The uniformity of acid generator distribution and the length of acid diffusion are serious problems in the development of resist materials used for the 16nm node and below. Anion-bound polymers in which the anion part of onium salts is polymerized have attracted much attention for solving these problems. In this study, the reaction mechanism of an anion-bound polymer in cyclohexanone was clarified using pulse radiolysis. The design of an efficient electron and hole transfer system is essential to the enhancement of resist performance.", "Gray-scale e-beam lithography has been performed to match the EUV and e-beam aerial image log slope for studying shot noise fundamentals in the two mechanisms through line-edge roughness (LER) measurements for 50 nm lines and spaces patterned on a leading chemically amplified EUV resist. The measured e-beam exposure latitude decreased from 0.4 with binary patterning to 0.28 with gray-scale e-beam exposure designed to match the EUV incident image profile, closely matching the EUV exposure latitude of 0.26. Calculations of absorption statistics with EUV and e-beam suggest that the shot noise with e-beam patterning is expected to be 10% larger than the shot noise with EUV patterning. However, despite the matched image gradients and close to identical absorbed quanta predictions, the e-beam patterned LER is 2.5\u00d7 larger than the EUV patterned LER.", "The NIST Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Reflectometry Facility was designed in the 1990s to accommodate the largest multilayer optics envisioned at that time. However, with increasing power requirements for an EUV scanner, source collection optics have grown larger and more steeply curved than the original design would allow. To accommodate these changes, the mechanical and operational parameters of the facility have been upgraded. To access the entire surface of a larger optic, an auxiliary off-axis rotation stage has been installed allowing an increase in maximum optic size from 350 mm to 450 mm. Likewise, to deal with the deeper sags and steeper slopes of these optics, we have had to significantly expand our data analysis capabilities. In order to make these measurements, the incident radiation is reflected out of the vertical plane, allowing for measurements of effectively unpolarized radiation, an advantage for EUV lithography optics such as source collectors.", "The first NXE3300B systems have been qualified and shipped to customers. The NXE:3300B is ASML\u2019s third generation EUV system and has an NA of 0.33. It succeeds the NXE:3100 system (NA of 0.25), which has allowed customers to gain valuable EUV experience. Good overlay and imaging performance has been shown on the NXE:3300B system in line with 22nm device requirements. Full wafer CDU performance of <1.5nm for 22nm dense and iso lines at a dose of ~16mJ/cm2 has been achieved. Matched machine overlay (NXE to immersion) of around 3.5nm has been demonstrated on multiple systems. Dense lines have been exposed down to 13nm half pitch, and contact holes down to 17nm half pitch. 10nm node Metal-1 layers have been exposed with a DOF of 120nm, and using single spacer assisted double patterning flow a resolution of 9nm has been achieved.\nSource power is the major challenge to overcome in order to achieve cost-effectiveness in EUV and enable introduction into High Volume Manufacturing. With the development of the MOPA+prepulse operation of the source, steps in power have been made, and with automated control the sources have been prepared to be used in a preproduction fab environment.\nFlexible pupil formation is under development for the NXE:3300B which will extend the usage of the system in HVM, and the resolution for the full system performance can be extended to 16nm. Further improvements in defectivity performance have been made, while in parallel full-scale pellicles are being developed.\nIn this paper we will discuss the current NXE:3300B performance, its future enhancements and the recent progress in EUV source performance.", "In last year\u2019s report, we discussed the design and requirements of the optical projection module (Projection Optics Box [POB]) for the 0.5-NA Micro-field Exposure Tool (MET5) and the resulting challenges. Over the course of this past year, we have completed and fully qualified the metrology of individual mirrors. All surface figure errors have been measured over seven orders of magnitude with spatial periods ranging from the full clear aperture down to 10 nm. The reproducibility of the full aperture tests measures 16 pm RMS for the M1 test and 17 pm for the M2 test with a target of 30 pm for both tests. Furthermore, we achieved excellent results on scatter and flare: For scatter, both mirrors perform about a factor of two below specification. For flare, the larger M2 mirror performs well within and the smaller M1 mirror about a factor of two below specification. In addition, we have developed processes for correcting surface figure errors for both mirrors and have successfully demonstrated high-reflectivity coatings on pathfinder mirrors. Further, we have achieved significant goals with respect to the design, assembly, metrology and alignment of the projection module. This paper reviews this progress and describes the next step in the ambitious MET5 POB development program.", "EUV lithography is expected to be introduced in volume manufacturing at the 10-nm and 7-nm node. Especially in these first EUV nodes, critical layer patterning will be balanced with the use of ArF immersion. As a consequence a good overlay and placement matching between both lithography methods becomes an enabling factor for EUV. In this paper we present an integral method to optimize critical layer patterning across the EUV and ArF scanner platform, such that good overlay and device pattern placement is achieved. It is discussed that besides classical overlay control methods, also the optimization of the ArF and EUV imaging steps is needed. Best matching is achieved by applying high-order field-to-field overlay corrections for both imaging and overlay. The lithography architecture we build for these higher order corrections connects the dynamic scanner actuators with the angle resolved scatterometer via a separate computational application server. Improvements of CD uniformity are based on source mask optimization for EUV combined with CD optimization using freeform intra-field dose actuator in the immersion scanner.", "In support of the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) roadmap, a SEMATECH/CNSE joint program is underway to produce multiple EUVL (wavelength of 13.5 nm) R&D photolithography tools. The 0.5 NA projection optic magnification (5X), track length and mechanical interfaces match the currently installed 0.3 NA micro-field exposure tools (MET) projection optic [1] [2] [3]. Therefore, significant changes to the current tool platforms and other adjacent modules are not necessary. However, many of the existing systems do need upgrades to achieve the anticipated smaller exposure feature sizes [4]. To date we have made considerable progress in the production of the first of the two-mirror 0.5 NA projection optics for EUVL [5]. With a measured transmitted wave front error of less than 1 nm root mean square (RMS) over its 30 \u03bcm \u00d7 200 \u03bcm image field, lithography modeling shows that a predicted resolution of \u226412 nm and an ultimate resolution of 8 nm (with extreme dipole illumination) will be possible.\nThis paper will present an update from the 0.5 NA EUVL program. We will detail the more significant activities that are being undertaken to upgrade the MET and discuss expected performance.", "As EUV approaches high volume manufacturing, reticle defectivity becomes an even more relevant topic for further investigation. Current baseline strategy for EUV defectivity management is to design, build and maintain a clean system without pellicle. In order to secure reticle front side particle adders to an acceptable level for high volume manufacturing, EUV pellicle is being actively investigated. Last year ASML reported on our initial EUV pellicle feasibility. In this paper, we will update on our progress since then. We will also provide an update to pellicle requirements published last year.

An industry effort to achieve consensus on the key parameters of high-NA EUV is described. At high-NA, three-dimensional (3D) mask effects cause a loss of contrast in the image that is recovered by increasing the scanner de-magnification. This leads to a tradeoff between wafer field and mask size that has considerable impact on mask cost and scanner cost of ownership.", "EUV technology has steadily progressed over the years including the introduction of a pre-production NXE:3100 scanner that has enabled EUV process development to advance one step closer to production. We have carried out the integration with 20/14nm metal layer design rules converting double patterning with ArF immersion process to EUV with a single patterning solution utilizing a NXE3100 exposure tool. The exercise through the integration of a mature test chip with an EUV level has allowed us to have early assessment of the process challenges and new workflow required to enable EUV to the mass production stage. Utilizing the NXE3100 in IMEC, we have developed an OPC model and a lithography process to support 20/14nm node EUV wafer integration of a metal layer in conjunction with immersion ArF. This allows early assessment of mix-and-match overlay for EUV to immersion system that is critical for EUV insertion strategy as well as further understanding of the litho process, OPC, and mask defect control specific to EUV single patterning. Through this work we have demonstrated high wafer yields on a 20nm test vehicle utilizing single EUV Metal layer along with additional ArF immersion levels. We were able to successfully demonstrate low mask defectivity and good via chain and open/short electrical yield. This paper summarize the learning cycles from mask defect mitigation and mix machine overlay through post metal CMP wafer integration highlighting the key accomplishments and future challenges.", "Traditionally, semiconductor density scaling has been supported by optical lithography. The ability of the exposure tools to provide shorter exposure wavelengths or higher numerical apertures have allowed optical lithography be on the forefront of dimensional scaling for the semiconductor industry. Unfortunately, the roadmap for lithography is currently at a juncture of a major paradigm shift. EUV Lithography is steadily maturing but not fully ready to be inserted into HVM. Unfortunately, there are no alternative litho candidates on the horizon that can take over from 193nm. As a result, it is important to look into the insertion point of EUV that would be ideal for the industry from an economical perspective. This paper details the benefit observed by such a transition. Furthermore, it looks into such detail with an EUV throughput sensitivity study.", "In EUV lithography (EUVL), the most critical issue has been low intensity of the EUV light source. Light-source intensity and resist sensitivity have a complementary relationship. Therefore, the sensitization of EUV resist is very important to compensate the low intensity of the EUV light source. However, dramatically improving the resist sensitivity of chemically amplified resist (CAR) is very difficult because of the resolution/line-width roughness/sensitivity (RLS) trade-off. Therefore, we propose a very new process: high resist sensitization by the combination lithography of EUV or EB pattern exposure with UV flood exposure (PF combination lithography) of photosensitized chemically amplified resist (PS-CAR). The combination lithography of EB pattern exposure with UV flood exposure achieved a sensitivity enhancement of more than a factor of 10 with respect to conventional EB single-exposure lithography, without loss in space resolution of line/space of 75 nm1. The breakthrough of RLS trade-off by PF combination lithography of PS-CAR is explained based on RLS trade-off simulation method2 and acid generation mechanism of PF combination lithography of PS-CAR. One of the problems of the PF combination lithography of PS-CAR is postexposure delay (PED) effects suffered from airborne contamination. The present paper describes forming of 75 nm contact hole and PED effects in the PF combination lithography of PS-CAR. The sensitization of EUV resists by new method accelerates EUVL implementation.", "We demonstrate the use of Prism Computational Sciences software models to understand the fundamental physical processes in EUVL (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) plasma. HELIOS-CR is a 1-D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code used to simulate the dynamic evolution of laser-produced plasmas (LPP) such as Sn or Xe plasmas used often in EUVL. The results of HELIOS-CR simulations can be post-processed using multidimensional spectral analysis code SPECT3D to generate images and spectra that include instrumental effects, and therefore can be directly compared with experimental measurements being made to generate EUVL. The SPECT3D package computes filtered and monochromatic images, and streaked, time-integrated, and time-gated spectra based on 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D radiation-hydrodynamics results. Simulated images and spectra can be computed with instrumental effects included (e.g., spectrometer resolution, time gating, filtering) in order to facilitate comparisons with experimental data. We present results which demonstrate impact of various parameters (laser power - pre-pulse and main pulse, spot size, pre-pulse and main pulse delay, etc.) on efficiency in EUVL, and shows possible improvement areas to achieve higher efficiency.", "To protect an EUV mask from contamination, a pellicle can be used. However, the pellicle membrane must be very thin due to EUV absorption. As a result, a pellicle support structure is needed to avoid deflection of the membrane by gravity. Previous authors have shown that such a structure would produce a non-uniform intensity distribution on the wafer. In this paper, we use simulation to re-examine the issue. The results show that, when coherent illumination is used, a pellicle support structure would have an undesirable effect on the aerial image. However, we also show that, when partially coherent illumination is used, the intensity non-uniformity caused by the pellicle support structure can be effectively smoothed out, resulting in a perfectly acceptable aerial image.", "Laser produced plasma (LPP) light sources for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography currently has been extensively studied. Most of the studies are based on CO2 laser induced plasma from mass limited tin targets. In this work, a droplet dispenser that produces uniform droplets size of about 150\u03bcm was established. A pulsed TEA-CO2 laser and a Nd: YAG laser irradiated the droplets producing plasma respectively to get EUV emission. An X-ray Spectrometer and EUV photodiodes were used to collect the spectra and EUV radiation. The different EUV spectral composition and angular distribution of EUV emission from plasmas induced by the CO2 and Nd: YAG laser were studied.", "The design, synthesis and characterization of non-chemically amplified negative tone electron-beam and EUV resists based on the inclusion of a radiation sensitive sulfonium functional group are outlined.. MAPDST (4-(methacryloyloxy phenyldimethylsulfoniumtriflate) and MANTMS (1-(4-(methacryloyloxy)naphthalen-1-yl)tetrahydro-1H thiopheniumtrifluoromethane sulfonate) monomers each containing the sulfonium group underwent homo- and copolymerizations using free radical polymerization with 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) initiator. These resist materials were evaluated by EB lithography using 20 keV electron beam and EUV lithography to obtain sub-20 nm line patterns. These features were optimized ranging from resist coating, pre-exposure bake, exposure to e-beam, postexposure bake, development and imaging. Our investigation showed that these newly synthesized resists are potential viable candidates for EUV lithography based on their ability to form flaw free thin films < 50nm, sensitivity, resolution and LER control.", "The half-tone phase shift mask (PSM) has been suggested for better imaging performances like image contrast, NILS and H-V bias compared to the binary mask (BIM) in EUV lithography. In this paper, we measured imaging performance of a fabricated half-tone attenuated PSM with Coherent Scattering Microscopy (CSM) and the results were compared with simulation data obtained by EM-suite tool. We prepared a half-tone attenuated PSM which has 12.7% reflectivity and 180\u00b0 phase shift with absorber stack of 16.5mn-thick TaN absorber and 24nm-thick Mo phase shifter. With CSM, an actinic inspection tool, we measured the imaging properties of PSM. The diffraction efficiencies of BIM were measured as 31%, 36%, and 44% for 88 nm, 100 nm, and 128 nm mask CD, respectively, while those of PSM were measured as 45%, 62%, and 81%. Also the aerial image at wafer level obtained by CSM with high volume manufacturing tool\u2019s (HVM) illumination condition (NA=0.33, \u03c3=0.9) showed higher image contrast and NILS with phase shift effect. And the measured data were consistent with the simulation data.", "It is expected that EUV resists must simultaneously pattern 20-nm half-pitch and below, with an LWR of <1.8 nm, and a sensitivity of 5\u201320 mJ/cm2. In order to make a resist perform optimally, new resist chemistry is required. One such approach being investigated by us is the development of polymeric non-CAR negative photo resists for sub 16 nm technology which is directly sensitive to radiation without utilizing the concept of chemical amplification (CARs). These resist designs are accomplished by homopolymers which are prepared from monomers containing sulfonium groups. We have achieved 20 nm patterns by e-beam lithography using this system. Here we will discuss in detail process parameters such as: spinning conditions for film thicknesses <50 nm and resulting surface topographies, baking regimes, exposure conditions and protocols on sensitivity, contrast, resolution and LER/LWR. Etch resistance data on these thin films will also be provided. Our results are aimed to provide a clear understanding of how these critical steps in the lithographic imaging process will affect extendibility of the non-CAR resist concept to sub 20 nanoscale features. Photodynamics and EUV exposure data will be covered.", "With current progress in exposure source power, novel resist materials, and post processing techniques, EUV is getting closer to the production environment. As reported continuously, SEMATECH established cycles of learning program. The data generated from the program has been utilized to measure current state of the art of EUV photoresist for production or pilot line use. Thanks to SEMATECH core and associate members\u2019 attention to the project, numerous EUV samples have been tested and they were based on the best performing EUV resists from associate members. This year we completed the evaluations for under-layers, lines and spaces, and contact holes. We also applied track based techniques to drive both low line edge roughness control and enlarge the process window with techniques such as FIRMTM and track based smoothing process. In this paper we will discuss about the results from cycles of learning test and show post-processing results of the three best line and space resists when combined with different FIRMTM materials.", "A major challenge for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is avoiding defects in the fabrication of multilayered (ML) mask blanks. Substrate defects and adders during ML coating are responsible for ML defects which causes changes on phase and amplitude of EUV light. ML defects must be identified by inspection prior to absorber patterning in order to reduce the effects of ML defects via covering them with patterns to permit the use of fewer ML defect blanks. Fiducial marks (FMs) on ML blanks can be used for mask alignment and to accurately and precisely determine the locations of ML defects. In this study, we fabricated an FM mask by resist exposure using an e-beam writer and etching. Then, we inspected FMs and ML defects with an EUV actinic full-field mask blank inspection tool developed by EIDEC-LaserTec (LT ABI). Next, we evaluated the ML defect location accuracy on the mask based on FMs of several line depths by deriving center position of FMs and defects with Lorentz, Gaussian fitting and center-of-mass calculation. Here, we explain the estimation of defect location accuracy using FMs and the LT ABI, and discuss the defect numbers which can be covered by absorber patterns. Fewer than 19 defects per blank should be required for EUV blanks to cover ML defects with patterns.", "In this study, influence of geometric features of phase defect on EUV optical images, such as dark field images(ABI tool) and bright field images (Exposure tool), was studied with experiment and simulation. It is confirmed that ABI signal intensity has a direct relationship not only with defect volume but also with geometric features of the phase defect. A new method for the making of phase defect models for simulation purpose was attempted. With this new method, the simulated ABI signal intensity exhibited a good proportionality relationship with the experimentally obtained ABI signal intensity. This method is believed to be effective in the estimation of ABI signal intensity with simulation. These results lead to the conclusion that it is important to take into consideration the geometric features of phase defects when a relationship between ABI signal intensity and phase defect feature is to be examined. Also, the relationship between ABI signal intensity and impact of defect on wafer was studied with simulation. In this study, many geometric types of phase defects were used, and relationships between these defects and their impacts on wafers were studied. As a result, it was confirmed that the geometric features did not strongly affect the relationship between the ABI signal intensity and the defects\u2019 impacts on wafer however the ABI signal intensity is found to have a close relationship with impact of defect on wafer. These results lead to the conclusion that information about ABI signal intensity is important not only for the detection of phase defect but also for estimating the impact of phase defects on wafers.", "In this paper, the latest advances in the field of extreme ultra violet (EUV) light sources for application in counter-facing plasma focus devices are presented. EUV emission, plasma and electrical properties under two pulses operation are reported. Using this new plasma focus system, the total amount of supply material and the energy cost of the plasma source could be reduced. The physical behavior during a two-pulse experiment with a high repetition rate (1 kHz) is explained. Continuous operation for future practical use in advanced lithography systems is also investigated.", "The effect of phase defect on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography was examined using an EUV microscope. A test mask containing periodic absorber line patterns and programmed pit phase defects embedded in a multilayer-coated mask blank was prepared, and the mask patterns were observed by the EUV microscope developed by Tohoku University and constructed at the site of a beam line of the New SUBARU of the University of Hyogo. The half pitches of the absorber patterns were 64 nm and 44 nm at mask which corresponded to 16 nm and 11 nm device generations. The programmed defects included not only square-shape defects but also rectangular-shape defects with different orientations. When a phase defect was located between two adjacent absorber patterns, then the observation image intensity of the absorber lines and spaces (L/S) patterns varied, and the impact of a phase defect was predicted as an intensity variation of bright space image. Phase defect location dependency and defect shape dependency of the observation image intensity were examined. The effectiveness of the EUV microscope to predict the phase defect impacts was confirmed.", "Influence of phase defect structures on Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) microscope images were examined to predict the inclination angle dependency of the phase defect impact on wafers since the phase defect does not always propagate in a vertical direction from an EUV mask substrate surface through the multilayer. Two types of the programmed phase defect mask were prepared. One is an EUV blank with programmed bump phase defects to analyze the inclination angle of the phase defects. The other is a programmed phase defect EUV mask that consists of bump phase defects of 80-nmwide and 2.4-nm-high with half-pitch 88 nm lines-and-spaces pattern. The positions of the phase defects relative to the absorber lines were designed to be shifted accordingly. Transmission electron microscope observation revealed that the bump phase defects starting from the substrate surface propagated through the multilayer toward the center of the substrate as they reach the top surface of the multilayer. At the distances of 0 and 66 mm from the substrate center, the inclination angles varied from 0 to 4 degrees. The impacts of the inclination angles on EUV microscope images were significant even though the positions of the phase defect relative to the absorber line, as measured by a scanning prove microscope, were same.", "EUV lithography (EUVL) is well known to be a strong candidate for next generation, single exposure, sub-30nm half-pitch lithography. Much progress relevant to EUVL has been reported for a decade, however, many issues continue to challenge implementation for volume production.[1,2] On the other hand, it seems that the coat develop track process remains very similar and in many aspects returns to KrF or ArF dry process fundamentals, but in practice 26-32nm pitch patterning coat develop track process also has challenges with EUV resist. As access to EUV lithography exposures has become more readily available over the last five (5) years, several challenges and accomplishments in track processing have been reported, such as the improvement of ultra-thin film coating, CD uniformity, defectivity, line width roughness (LWR), and so on.[3,4,5,6] The coat-develop track process has evolved along with novel materials and metrology capability improvements. By coating ultra-thin under layers and resist films and by controlling resist dissolution, the SOKUDO DUO coat develop track system at IMEC (Leuven, Belgium), with ASML NXE3100 exposure, has been used to demonstrate improved CD uniformity, LWR, and defect control. Additionally, we will show the latest lithographic results obtained by novel processing approaches in EUV coat develop track system.", "Over the past several years, people have accomplished a great deal of developing the Extreme-ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technologies. However, several problems which disturb the mass-production of EUVL still remain. One of the problems is the defect control. In order to protect the mask from defect, the usage of the pellicle is essential. However the transmission loss caused by contamination can lead to the pattern error. Therefore it is necessary to find the acceptable thickness of the contamination layer that would cause the image error. The protection ability of the pellicle in terms of critical dimension variation is studied. Our study indicated that the process latitude difference is small enough to ignore whether the pellicle is used or not. In addition the protection ability of pellicle is good against the case of conformal contamination in terms of CD variation.", "Resists, underlayers, and new rinse processes were evaluated for negative tone development (NTD) using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. The most recently developed resists show resolution and sensitivity improvements. High remaining-film thickness was also achieved for better etching resistance. The underlayers smoothed the line width roughness (LWR) and prevented pattern collapse. In addition, the proposed NTD-compatible rinse process further assisted to prevent pattern collapse. The best NTD performance at EIDEC till date was achieved: 22 nm line and space (L/S) resolution, 5.4 nm LWR, and 16.8 mJ/cm2 sensitivity with annular illumination for a small-field exposure tool (SFET). Furthermore, an ultimate resolution of 17 nm L/S was achieved with x-dipole illumination of SFET. The lithographic performance of the best NTD resist is comparable to the typical positive tone development resist.", "We report the effect of the mesh support for the EUV pellicle on the wafer pattern image. The intensity distribution passing through the meshed pellicle was simulated with a partially coherent EUV beam showing that its non-uniformity and the CD uniformity are increased with the mesh width. In order to reduce a non-uniformity of the intensity distribution and CD uniformity, the mesh width should be narrower and the height becomes smaller as well. Thus, the image deformation on the wafer due to the mesh can be avoided by optimizing the mesh structure and thus the pellicle with the mesh support can be used for the EUV lithography.", "Berliner Glas is a privately owned, mid-sized manufacturer of precision opto-mechanics in Germany. One specialty of Berliner Glas is the design and production of high performance vacuum and electrostatic wafer chucks. Driven by the need of lithography and inspection for smaller overlay values, we pursue the production of an ideally flat wafer chuck. An ideally flat wafer chuck holds a wafer with a completely flat backside and without lateral distortion within the wafer surface.\nKey parameters in influencing the wafer chucks effective flatness are thermal performance and thermal management, roughness of the surface, choice of materials and the contact area between wafer and wafer chuck. In this presentation we would like to focus on the contact area. Usually this is decreased as much as possible to avoid sticking effects and the chance of trapped particles between the chuck surface and the backside of the wafer. This can be realized with a pin structure on the chuck surface. Making the pins smaller and moving pins further apart from each other makes the contact area ever smaller but also adds new challenges to achieve a flat and undistorted wafer on the chuck. We would like to address methods of designing and evaluating such a pin structure.\nThis involves not only the capability to simulate the ideal pattern of pins on the chuck\u2019s surface, for which we will present 2D and 3D simulation results. As well, we would like to share first results of our functional models. Finally, measurement capability has to be ensured, which means improving and further development of Fizeau flatness test interferometers.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is one of the most promising technologies for 11 nm node. In this paper, a six-mirror objective system with a higher numerical aperture (NA) 0.5 and a central obscuration was designed with grouping design method. Some key issues about grouping design and control of obscuration were discussed in detail. Design result shows that the size of obscuration is smaller than 30% radius of the pupil and the composite Root-Mean-Square (RMS) wavefront error can reach 0.029 \u03bb (\u03bb=13.5 nm) in a 13 mm\u00d71 mm ring field. Design of this six-mirror objective system provides a potential solution for 11 nm node of EUV lithography.", "We simulated the process parameters of a pattern formation reaction that included during-the-exposure and post exposure bake (PEB) processes using an originally developed simulator. From the simulation results, the relationship between process parameters of pattern formation reaction and quencher concentration has been clarified. Moreover, we simulated the present target process parameters of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resist for breaking the RLS trade-off. In this simulation, the process parameters were calculated from lithographic results (sensitivity, LWR, and CD) using real SEM images. This methodology was used to determine the process parameters required to break the RLS trade-off to obtain the required lithographic target of the EUV resist. We simulated the present lithography performance target using the process parameters of pattern formation reactions. These simulation results showed that a large reaction radius is necessary to break the RLS trade-off. Furthermore, we confirmed that increasing the PEB temperature leads to an improvement in the reaction radius. However, there is a discrepancy between the target radius and the controllable range of reaction radius that can be obtained by varying the PEB temperature.", "Extreme-UV lithography (EUVL) is the most promising candidate of next generation technology for hp20nm node device manufacturing and beyond, however there are many critical issues to solve in the light source, tools, mask and photo resist. Regarding the development of a photo resist, it is necessary for high volume manufacturing (HVM) to improve LWR, resolution limit and sensitivity. Additionally, concerning about deterioration of a patterning performance by Out-of-Band (OoB) light existing in the EUV light, and contamination problem of exposure tool due to the photo resist outgassing are the key issues which have to be resolved toward HVM by EUVL. Especially, the outgassing problem can become a significant issue for fine patterning under high dose exposure condition. This paper proposes the novel solution for these critical issues with the application of a top coat material which is named OBPL (Outgassing & out-of-Band Protection Layer) on photo resist. The key characteristics of OBPL material are to have a role in protection against the OoB adverse effect to keep up the photo resist performance, to suppress the outgassing from photo resist as a barrier layer and to enhance the lithographic performance such as photo resist profile and process window. In designing the OBPL material, the optical property needs having not only the high absorbance of DUV (Deep-UV) light in OoB range but also high transmittance for 13.5nm wavelength to prevent the sensitivity loss. Furthermore, it is found that the polymer backbone affects the outgassing barrier capability in previous evaluation. Based on these investigations, a state-of-the-art OBPL achieves quite a positive lithographic result with sufficient OoB absorption and outgassing suppression. Moreover, this material has applicability to all types of photo resist including NTD (Negative-Tone Development) process. This paper describes the result of the feasibility study for OBPL and the lithography performance with EUV full field scanner.", "At the Laboratory for Energy Conversion (LEC), ETH Zurich, droplet-based LPP-EUV light sources have been developed since 2007. The main LPP source is ALPS II, which is fully operational since more than one year. The facility is an engineering test stand for long-term e\u21b5ect studies. In order to improve the debris mitigation techniques, it is essential to investigate the droplet plasma dynamics in time and space. Recently a new diagnostic tool based on a multiple array of motorized Langmuir probes has been constructed for this purpose. The detector has been used to map the angular and radial distribution of the ion and electron dynamics around the droplet target. In this paper, some of the experimental results obtained with the new detector are reported. The angular and radial distribution of the ion flux and kinetic energy of the droplet plasma reveals an anisotropic expansion of the ions in terms of kinetic energy and amount of ion charge around the droplet target. These results have been obtained during continuous source operation and for the first time on droplet-based laser produced plasmas.", "At the Laboratory for Energy Conversion, ETH Zurich a new tin droplet-based laser-produced plasma source with application in EUV lithography is operational since Q3 2013. The EUV source ALPS II is equipped with a large capacity droplet dispenser and a high power (kW), high repetition rate (>6 kHz) Nd:YAG laser. The new source should address the requirements of high volume manufacturing for different inspection and metrology applications found in EUV lithography. The average source brightness is equal to 350 W/mm2sr. Individual droplet tracking in time and space, which is coupled to a droplet positioning and triggering system helps to increase the pulse-to-pulse EUV emission stability of the source. The lateral droplet stability is on the order of 10-15% of the droplet diameter. The individual droplet triggering yields deviations between the laser trigger and the droplet passage time at the irradiation site of less than 1 us, even for large droplet timing fluctuations (>5%). The in-band EUV radiation is measured with an energy monitor, which is coupled to a fast analog hardware-based integrator. The pulse-to-pulse EUV energy stability for high stability data equals 3% (\u03c3). In the case of window-averaged (0.1 s) data, the EUV stability equals 0.86% (\u03c3). Low stability data is also reported. The large brightness of the presented LPP-based light source can be tuned to adjust the EUV light stability that is required by the inspection tool.", "EUV lithography is likely more sensitive to drift from thermal and degradation effects than optical counterparts. We have developed an automated approach to photoresist image-based aberration metrology. The approach uses binary or phase mask targets and iterative simulation based solutions to retrieve an aberrated pupil function. It is well known that a partially coherent source both allows for the diffraction information of smaller features to be collected by the condenser system, and introduces pupil averaging. In general, smaller features are more sensitive to aberrations than larger features, so there is a trade-off between target sensitivity and printability. Therefore, metrology targets using this technique must be optimized for maximum sensitivity with each illumination system. This study examines aberration metrology target optimization and suggests an optimization scheme for use with any source. Interrogation of both low and high order aberrations is considered. High order aberration terms are interrogated using two separate fitting algorithms. While the optimized targets do show the lowest RMS error under the test conditions, a desirable RMS error is not achieved by either high order interrogation scheme. The implementation of a previously developed algorithm for image-based aberration metrology is used to support this work.", "As EUV lithography attempts to outperform other lithographical methods to the sub-14 nm node, the demand for a larger NA traditionally dominates the drive for scaling. There are, however, many challenges to overcome in order to accomplish this [1]. Due to the reflective optics in EUV systems, angular effects of oblique illumination, and non-zero chief ray angle at the objective (CRAO), must be carefully considered and will need to be well understood if high-NA EUV is to be successful. This study investigates impact on of the bias between horizontal and vertical feature CD, image placement error and NILS. Effects of sidewall absorber angle, absorption coefficient (k) and absorber thickness are observed through pitch with various source shapes in an EUV lithography system.", "Influence of phase defect on printed images of mask pattern was experimentally investigated by printing contact hole (CH) pattern of hp 32 nm on wafer. And the experimental results were compared with the simulation results. A test mask prepared for this experiment contained programmed phase defects of 92 nm ~ 34.8 nm in width and of around 0.68 nm ~ 1.65 nm in depth. The defects were arrayed in a way such that the pitch of the array would differ from the pitch of the absorber contact hole pitch. Therefore, the phase defects were placed at different positions relative to those of the CH patterns. Mask patterns were printed on wafer using an exposure tool NXE3100 with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.25 and a reduction of 4X. To evaluate the printed patterns affected by the phase defects, circular illumination was employed. The incident angle of mask illumination chief ray was 6 degrees. The printed CH patterns were measured by SEM. An influence of resolution limit of the resist pattern did seem to appear in this experiment, to be a quantitative difference between the simulation and experimental results, the relative location dependence was quite noticeable and the effect of a phase defect was mitigated by covering the defect with an absorber pattern.", "The minimum target specificatons of EUV resist material are the resolution < 30nm half pitch C/H, CDU < 3.0nm, and sensitivity < 20mJ. The major pending issue of EUV resist is how to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, high resolution and low CD Uniformity (CDU). Thus, we have studied that which factors such as acid diffusion, solvents, polymer platform and film density etc are affecting to improve CDU, sensitivity and resolution. Especially, CDU and sensitivity are the main issues among above these performances. With the results of these experiments, we could determine polymer blend PAG as polymer platform for EUV resist material. We have also researched polymer to improve the sensitivity and CDU with variation of molecular weight, poly dispersity and monomer feed ratio. Additionally, we have studied the effects of resist solvents and film density. And we have measured the outgas of our EUV resist. In this paper, we will discuss the results of these studies obtained by EUV tools of SEMATECH.", "193 nm inspection for various defect types on top of the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) mask is studied. The antireflection coating (ARC) is tried to enhance the defect inspection. However, adding ARC is not helpful to increase the sensitivity. Thus, 2 nm TaBO generally used for preventing the oxidation is mainly used. The aerial image deformation caused by the defect is compared to that of the defect free mask. Peak intensity difference is quantized and the sensitivity that is comparable to the ITRS defect inspection limit is chosen. The inspection criterion for typical defect types of extrusion, intrusion, pindot and pinhole is compared.", "The Critical Dimension (CD) uniformity due to the defect on the Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV) pellicle is reported. Based on computational simulation of the aerial images for different defect size on the wafer, it is found that the size of the defect should be smaller than 2 \u03bcm for the CD uniformity of 0.1 nm. The aerial image for the different defect materials, sulfur and ruthenium, are also simulated showing that the CD uniformity does not have a noticeable dependence on the different defect materials. However, the CD uniformity is worsened with the mesh structure due to its shadow and the much smaller defects size, less than 2 \u03bcm, can be allowed.", "The carbon contamination growth (CG) on the witness samples by resist outgassing during exposure were evaluated for the model EUV resist samples having different protecting groups for chemical amplification. Four kinds of different protecting groups were chosen to compare the effects of difference in activation energy for de-protection, the molecular size and polarity of de-protected unit on CG. The residual gas analysis (RGA) measurements were also performed for all samples. Those results were compared between EUV irradiation and e-beam irradiation. On the contrary to the original expectation, it was found that the dependence of the activation energy on CG was small. From the results of RGA, it was confirmed that the size of the protecting group does not also simply correlate with the outgassing amount or CG. In the sample with relatively bigger protecting group we found larger outgassing amount than that with smaller protecting group. The smallest outgassing amount and CG were given by the sample which has the polar de-protecting unit. It is indicating that if there is the interaction between the outgassing molecules and the resist film components, the escaping of the molecules from the resist film out to the vacuum is restricted, resulting in the small outgassing and small CG. All of those features were same in EUV and e-beam irradiation.", "EUV masks have replicated multilayer roughness from the substrate or the deposition process which cause line edge roughness (LER) during imaging. We have developed a model, based on the assumption that the roughness is small, that is able to analytically calculate the LER and LER Power Spectral Density (PSD) for any illumination source, defocus, and pitch. We evaluated the model for typical mask roughness values and varied illumination and other parameters to determine how the roughness induced LER behaves under different imaging conditions.", "For the introduction of EUV lithography, development of high performance EUV resists is of key importance. This development involves studies into resist sensitivity, resolving power and pattern uniformity. We have used a sub-nanometer-sized 30 keV helium ion beam to expose chemically amplified (CAR) EUV resists. There are similarities in the response of resists to He+ ions and EUV photons: both excite Secondary Electrons with similar energy distributions.The weak backscattering of the He+ ions results in ultra-low proximity effects. This fact enables the exposure of dense and detailed patterns by focused He+ ion beams without the need for proximity correction. This paper presents contact holes and lines at 40-nm pitch in an EUV CAR resist. We have used resist sensitivity, contrast, resolution (CD) and pattern fidelity (LCDU, LWR and dose-to-print) as metrics for a comparison of SHIBL with EUVL. We show that Scanning Helium Ion Beam Lithography (SHIBL) can be a useful and economically attractive technology to (pre-)screen novel EUV resists prior to their final performance evaluation in an EUV scanner.", "Particle free handling of EUV reticles is a major concern in industry. For reaching economically feasible yield levels, it is reported that Particle-per-Reticle-Pass (PRP) levels should be better than 0.0001 for particles larger than 18 nm. Such cleanliness levels are yet to be reported for current reticle handling systems. A reticle handler was built based on a modular concept with three uniform linked base frames. In the first stage of the project a dual pod loading unit, two exchange units for opening inner pods and a reticle flip unit are installed on the base frames. In the near future improvements on cleanliness will be tested and particle detection equipment will be integrated. The system will act as a testing platform for clean handling technology for industry.", "Patterning uncertainty in EUV lithography arises from each lithographic component: the source, the photomask, the optical system, and the photoresist. All contribute to line roughness and contact disuniformity. In extreme cases, feature variability can result in patterning failures such as line microbridging or random missing contact holes. Historically, redundant contact holes (or vias) were placed to overcome the effects of a missing contact. Due to the aggressive CD shrink of feature size, the use of redundant contacts has been progressively decreased. For some types of devices, almost every contact of the billions found on the chip must be electrically active in order for the device to function. In such scenario, lithographic printing failures may cause catastrophic loss of yield, considering that closed contacts can hardly be corrected by smoothing techniques or etching. In this paper, the minimum contact CD which prints without failure \u2013 the contact hole printability limit \u2013 is studied for 54nm and 44nm pitch dense arrays. We find that the same resist may show dramatically different printability limits depending upon sizing dose and illumination conditions. This analysis will be implemented to estimate, through simulation-assisted experiments, the required exposure dose and aerial image to safely print sub-30nm contact holes.", "This paper describes the development of a laser-produced-plasma (LPP) extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) source for advanced lithography applications in high volume manufacturing. EUV lithography is expected to succeed 193nm immersion double patterning technology for sub- 20nm critical layer patterning. In this paper we discuss the most recent results from high power testing on our development systems targeted at the 250W configuration, and describe the requirements and technical challenges related to successful implementation of these technologies. Subsystem performance will be shown including Conversion Efficiency (CE), dose control, collector protection and out-of-band (OOB) radiation measurements. This presentation reviews the experimental results obtained on systems with a focus on the topics most critical for a 250W HVM LPP source.", "The feasibility of wafer-plane measurements of EUV mask surface roughness has been analyzed through stochastic resist simulations at various defocus conditions, for mask surface roughness values ranging between 50 pm and 500 pm rms. With partial coherence of 0.5, NA of 0.25, defocus of 100 nm and mask surface roughness of 50 pm rms, 1.3% of the total resist LER is contributed by the mask surface roughness induced aerial image phase roughness, while 39.1% of the total LER contribution comes from the absorbed photon image. 31.4% of the LER contribution is from the acid image and 27.9% is attributable to the quencher image at the end of the PEB reaction/diffusion processes. For surface roughness values of interest ranging between 50 pm and 150 pm rms, partial coherence of 0.5 and 100 nm defocus, the sensitivity of wafer plane aerial image LER to mask surface roughness is 9.5 nm/nm-rms, while the resist LER sensitivity is 2.9 nm/nm-rms. With hypothetical scaling of the resist parameters, the resist LER sensitivity to mask surface roughness increases to 6 nm/nm-rms.", "In EUV lithography, the short wavelength of the light makes the topography of the mask stand out as three dimensional objects rather than thin masks. This generally requires use of a rigorous scattering simulator to calculate the diffracted orders of a mask in order to explain experimental results. In contrast, for optical proximity correction we cannot afford such detailed calculations and we would like to replace such detailed simulations with faster methods that give similar results. In this paper, we discuss observations we made during our printing experiments on a 0.33 NA EUV projection system. In order to extend the process window for non-nested trenches we introduced clear assist features. We observed strong tilt of Bossung curves and best focus shifts for certain pitches. These shifts can be explained by a phase difference between main and assist feature. This effect is very similar for both horizontal and vertical trenches, and it depends strongly on the illumination of the mask. We find that the best focus shift can be minimized for certain assist pitches and illumination conditions, but a general solution for random pitches appears not obvious.", "We present a novel approach for wavefront sensing based on scanning diffraction imaging suitable for high-NA optics inspection, where common metrology techniques show limitations. This approach employs ptychography, whereby a well-characterized object is scanned at the focus of the aberrated test optic, and the resulting scat tered light is captured on a CCD. Under the Fresnel approximation, the diffraction patterns are processed in an iterative algorithm to reconstruct the test optic aberrations. We discuss the applicability of this wavefront metrology, present numerical simulations that validate the reconstruction, and show first experimental results from an optical prototype.", "We present an update of the AIS wavefront sensor, a diagnostic sensor set for insertion in the upgraded 0.5 NA SEMATECH Albany and Berkeley METs. AIS works by using offset monopole illumination to probe localized regions of the test optic pupil. Variations in curvature manifest as focus shifts, which are measured using a photodiode- based grating-on- grating contrast monitor, and the wavefront aberrations are reconstructed using a least-squares approach. We present results from an optical prototype of AIS demonstrating an accuracy of better than \u03bb/30 rms for Zernike polynomials Z4 through Z10. We also discuss integration strategies and requirements as well as specifications on system alignment.", "EUV is an ongoing industry challenge to adopt due to its current throughput limitations. The approach to improve throughput has primarily been through a significant focus on source power which has been a continuing challenge for the industry. The subject of this paper is to review and investigate the application of SADP (Self aligned double patterning) as a speed enhancing technique for EUV processing. A process with the potential of running a 16 nm self-aligned final etched pattern in less than 10mJ exposure range is proposed. Many of the current challenges with shot noise and resolution change significantly when SADP is used in conjunction with EUV. In particular, the resolution challenge for a 16nm HP final pattern type image changes to 32nm as an initial pattern requirement for the patterned CD.\nWith this larger CD starting point, the burden of shot noise changes significantly and the ability for higher speed resist formulations to be used is enabled. Further resist candidates that may have not met the resolution requirements for EUV can also be evaluated. This implies a completely different operational set-point for EUV resist chemistry where the relaxation of both LER and CD together combined, give the resist formulation space a new target when EUV is used as a SADP tool. Post processing mitigation of LWR is needed to attain the performance of the final 16nm half pitch target pattern to align with the industry needs.\nIf the original process flow at an 85W projected source power would run in the 50WPH range, then the flow proposed here would run in the <120WPH range. Although it is a double patterning technology, the proposed process still only requires a single pass through the EUV tool, This speed benefit can be used to offset the added costs associated with the double patterning process. This flow can then be shown to be an enabling approach for many EUV applications.", "Laser-produced plasma (LPP) sources for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) systems utilize CO2 lasers operating with wavelength 10.6\u03bcm. Since multilayer-coated optics have high reflectivity for this infrared radiation (IR), a significant and detrimental amount of IR is passed through the EUVL system. One method to remove the IR from the system is to utilize a binary diffraction grating. When this grating is applied directly to the surface of the primary collector optic of the source, the majority of the IR is diverted outside the radius of the exit aperture at the intermediate focus (IF). This paper will report details on the performance of a full size (410mm diameter) Demonstration Collector utilizing IR rejection (IRR) technology with the capability to produce over 125X suppression of IR, equaling the performance of a IR spectral filter. Additional details will be reported on the technology development and use of a glassy smoothing layer to enable high EUV performance, a weighted average multilayer reflectance of 50.9% for unpolarized EUV radiation.", "Lithographic CD printing variability can be easily captured with a CDU measurement, however delineating the most significant sources causing the variability is challenging. In EUV lithography, the resist, reticle, metrology methodology, and stochastics are examples of factors that influence printing variability. Determining the most significant sources of variability in contact hole and via patterning is particularly interesting because the variability can be measured as a function of two tethered dimensions. Contact hole (CH) variability has a direct impact on device performance while via variability affects metal area scaling and design. By studying sources of variability opportunities for improving device performance and scaling can be identified. In this paper, we will examine sources of contact patterning variability in EUV lithography comprehensively using various EUV exposure tools as well as simulation methods. We will present a benchmark of current state of the art materials and patterning methods with the goal of assessing contact hole printability at the limit of 0.33 NA EUV lithography.", "A fast rigorous model is developed for the simulation of mask diffraction spectrum in EUV lithography. It combines a modified thin mask model and an equivalent layer method and provides an analytical expression of the diffraction spectrum of mask. Based on this model, we propose a theoretical analysis of the mask shadowing effect. Mathematical expressions for the best mask (object space) focus position and for the required correction of mask pattern size are derived. When the mask focus is positioned in the equivalent plane of the multilayer, the amount of pattern shift is reduced. When the mask pattern size is corrected using the derived formula, taking a space pattern with the target CD of 22 nm as an example, the imaging CD bias between different oriented features is below 0.3 nm.", "To evaluate defects on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) masks at the blank state of manufacturing, we developed a micro coherent EUV scatterometry microscope (micro-CSM). The illumination source is coherent EUV light with a 230-nm focus diameter on the defect using a Fresnel zoneplate. This system directly observes the reflection and scattering signals from a phase defect. The scattering distributions of 30-nm-wide defects were anisotropic due to interference with speckle from multilayer scattering. Thus, printability of the defects would depend on the defect position in the multilayer.", "Inorganic resists are of considerable interest for advanced lithography at the nanoscale due to the potential for high resolution, low line width roughness (LWR), and high sensitivity. Historically inorganic resists suffered from low sensitivity, however approaches have been identified to increase sensitivity while maintaining high contrast. An aqueous precursor of Hf(OH)4-2x-2y(O2)x(SO4)y\u00b7qH2O (HafSOx) has been demonstrated with excellent sensitivity to EUV and electrons, while still obtaining high resolution and low LWR. In this work, we characterize both HafSOx precursor solutions and spin-coated thin films using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analysis. HR-TEM of precursor solutions drop cast onto TEM grids confirmed the presence of nanoscale particles. HR-TEM cross sectional images showed that spin-coated HafSOx films are initially uniform in appearance and composition for thin (12 nm) films, however thicker (30 nm) films display segregation of species leading to multilayer structures. Regardless of film thickness, extended exposure to the high energy TEM electron beam induces significant migration of oxygen species to the Si interface. These species result in the formation of SiOx layers that increase in thickness with an increase in TEM electron beam dose. Sulfate is also very mobile in the films and likely assists in the significant condensation exhibited in completely processed films.", "Availability of defect-free masks is considered to be a critical issue for enabling extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) as the next generation technology. Since completely defect-free masks will be hard to achieve, it is essential to have a good understanding of the defect printability as well as the fundamental aspects of a defect that result in the defects being printed. In this work, the native mask blank defects were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cross-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the defect printability of the characterized native mask defects was evaluated using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. The simulation results were compared with the through-focus aerial images obtained at the SEMATECH Actinic Inspection Tool (AIT) at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) for the characterized defects. There was a reasonable agreement between the through-focus FDTD simulation results and the AIT results. To model the Mo/Si multilayer growth over the native defects, which served as the input for the FDTD simulations, a level-set technique was used to predict the evolution of the multilayer disruption over the defect. Unlike other models that assume a constant flux of atoms (of materials to be deposited) coming from a single direction, this model took into account the direction and incident fluxes of the materials to be deposited, as well as the rotation of the mask substrate, to accurately simulate the actual deposition conditions. The modeled multilayer growth was compared with the cross-section TEM images, and a good agreement was observed between them.", "Mask blank defectivity remains a challenge in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. One of the mitigation strategies has been to identify the source of particles causing defects in the mask blank deposition tools. Vacuum components like valves, valve seals, stages, filters, etc. could be a possible source of particles in the tools. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the amount of particles generated by the vacuum components. This feedback to the supplier can be used to help make vacuum components that shed fewer particles. We show results from a valve and nanoparticle particle test system at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) in collaboration with SEMATECH. The setup consists of a condensation particle counter (CPC), which can detect particles between 10 nm \u2013 3 um, and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), which can provide the size distribution of the particles between 10 nm \u2013 280 nm. We show results from testing two different types of 300 mm valves and compare the particle counts per cycle detected by the CPC for both. Moreover, choosing the best operating parameters of the valve can reduce the number of defects generated. We will present the optimized operating parameters. Selection of appropriate valve seal materials for plasma environments can also be crucial for reducing their degradation.", "Thermal Scanning Probe Lithography (tSPL) is an AFM based patterning technique, which uses heated tips to locally evaporate organic resists such as molecular glasses [1] or thermally sensitive polymers.[2][3] Organic resists offer the versatility of the lithography process known from the CMOS environment and simultaneously ensure a highly stable and low wear tip-sample contact due to the soft nature of the resists. Patterning quality is excellent up to a resolution of sub 15 nm,[1] at linear speeds of up to 20 mm/s and pixel rates of up to 500 kHz.[4] The patterning depth is proportional to the applied force which allows for the creation of 3-D profiles in a single patterning run.[2] In addition, non-destructive imaging can be done at pixel rates of more than 500 kHz.[4] If the thermal stimulus for writing the pattern is switched off the same tip can be used to record the written topography with Angstrom depth resolution. We utilize this unique feature of SPL to implement an efficient control system for reliable patterning at high speed and high resolution. We combine the writing and imaging process in a single raster scan of the surface. In this closed loop lithography (CLL) approach, we use the acquired data to optimize the writing parameters on the fly. Excellent control is in particular important for an accurate reproduction of complex 3D patterns. These novel patterning capabilities are equally important for a high quality transfer of two-dimensional patterns into the underlying substrate. We utilize an only 3-4 nm thick SiOx hardmask to amplify the 8\u00b10.5 nm deep patterns created by tSPL into a 50 nm thick transfer polymer. The structures in the transfer polymer can be used to create metallic lines by a lift-off process or to further process the pattern into the substrate. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of 27 nm wide lines and trenches 60 nm deep into the Silicon substrate.[5] In addition, the combined read and write approach ensures that the lateral offset between read and write field is minimized. Thus we achieve high precision in marker-less stitching of patterning fields. A 2D cross-correlation technique is used to determine the offset of a neighboring patterning field relative to a previously written field with an accuracy of about 1 nm. We demonstrate stitching of 1 \u03bcm2 fields with ~5 nm accuracy and stitching of larger 10x10 \u03bcm2 fields with 10 nm accuracy.[6]", "Within last two years, we have shown the positive-tone, development-less patterning of calixarene molecular glass resists using highly confined electric field, current-controlled scanning probe lithography scheme. Herein, we give a more detailed view insight describing the applied Scanning Probe Lithography (SPL) technology platform applying selfactuating, self-sensing cantilever. The experimental results are supported by first preliminary simulation results estimating the local electric field strength, the electron trajectories, and the current density distribution at the sample surface. In addition, the diameter of Fowler-Nordheim electron beam, emitted from SPL-tip, was calculated as function of the bias voltage for different current set-points and tip radii. In experimental part we show the reproducible writing of meander line patterns as well as the patterning of individual features using specially developed pattern generator software tool.", "We present a simulation study of the near-field Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imaging technique to break the diffraction limit of conventional lithography for spatial frequency multiplication. Rigorous electromagnetic simulations are performed to investigate the near-field EUV imaging performance and its process capability. An optical index, depth of thickness fluctuation (DOT) is defined to characterize the tolerable variation of the imaging-layer thickness, which plays a key role in evaluating the feasibility of this lithography technology. High sensitivity of the near-field image (profile and amplitude) to both absorber CD and propagation depth is found in transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) illumination modes. Despite the attractive prospect of applying this near-field imaging technique for semiconductor manufacturing, technical challenges from its optical performance and process control are non-trivial.", "Flexible electronics is a growing field and is currently maturing in applications such as displays, smart packaging, organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic cells. In order to process on flexible substrates at high throughput and large areas, novel patterning techniques will be essential. Conventional optical lithography is limited in throughput as well as resolution, and requires several alignment steps to generate multi-layered patterns, required for applications such as thin-film transistors. It therefore remains a complex and expensive process. Nanoimprint lithography is an emerging alternative to optical lithography, demonstrating patterning capabilities over a wide range of resolutions, from several microns down to a few nanometres. For display applications, nanoimprint lithography can be used to pattern various layers. Micron sized thin-film transistors for backplane can be fabricated where a self-aligned geometry is used to decrease the number of alignment steps, and increase the overlay accuracy. In addition, nano-structures can be used for optical applications such as anti-reflective surfaces and nano patterned transparent electrodes. Imprint lithography is a fully roll-to-roll compatible process and enables large area and high throughput fabrication for flexible electronics. In this paper we discuss the possibilities and the challenges of large area patterning by roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography, reviewing micron and nano sized structures realized on our roll-to-roll equipment. Nano patterned transparent electrodes, moth-eye antireflective coatings, and multilevel structures will be covered.", "Extremely large-area roll-to-roll manufacturing on flexible substrates is ubiquitous for applications such as paper and plastic processing. The challenge is to extend this approach to the realm of nanopatterning and realize similar benefits. Display applications, including liquid crystal (LCD), organic light emitting diode (OLED) and flexible displays are particularly interesting because of the ability to impact multiple levels in the basic display. Of particular interest are the polarizer, DBEF, thin film transistor and color filter; roll-based imprinting has the opportunity to create high performance components within the display while improving the cost of ownership of the panel. Realization of these devices requires both a scalable imprinting technology and tool. In this paper, we introduce a high volume roll-based nanopatterning system, the LithoFlex 350TM. The LithoFlex 350 uses an inkjet based imprinting process similar to the technology demonstrator tool, the LithoFlex 100, introduced in 2012. The width of the web is 350mm and patterning width is 300mm. The system can be configured either for Plate-to-Roll (P2R) imprinting (in which a rigid template is used to pattern the flexible web material) or for Roll-to-Plate imprinting (R2P) (in which a web based template is used to pattern either wafers or panels). Also described in this paper are improvements to wire grid polarizer devices. By optimizing the deposition, patterning and etch processes, we have been able to create working WGPs with transmittance and extinction ratios as high as 44% and 50,000, respectively.", "The high throughput and large area nanostructuring of flexible substrates by continuous roller processes has great potential for future custom applications like wire grid polarizers, antireflection films, or super-hydrophobic surfaces. For each application different material characteristics have to be considered, e.g. refractive index, hydrophobicity, or dry etch stability. Herein, we show experimental results of nanoimprint lithography resist developments focused on inkjetable and photo-curable resists suitable for high throughput production, especially roll-to-roll NIL. The inkjet deposition of the novel materials is demonstrated by the use of different state-of-the-art inkjet printheads at room temperature. A plate-to-plate process on silicon substrates was successfully implemented on a NPS300 nano patterning stepper with previously inkjet dispensed NIL resist. Furthermore, we demonstrate a throughput of 30 m min-1 in a roller NIL process on PET. Dry etching of unstructured thin films on Si wafers was performed, and it was demonstrated that the etch stability in Si is tunable to a value of 3.5:1 by a concise selection of the resist components. The surface roughness of the etched films was measured to be < 2 nm, after etching of around 100 nm of the resist films what is an essential factor for a low line edge roughness. All resists reported herein can be deposited via inkjet dispensing at room temperature, are suitable for continuous high throughput imprinting on flexible substrates, and are applicable in step-wise NIL processes with good etch resistance in dry etch processes.", "Technologies for pattern fabrication on a flexible substrate are being developed for various flexible devices. A patterning technique for a smaller pattern of the order of sub-100 nm will be needed in the near future. Roll-to-roll Nano-Imprint Lithography (RtR-NIL) is a promising candidate for extremely low-cost fabrication of large-area devices in large volumes. A residual layer thickness (RLT) of a pattern transferred by RtR-NIL distributes at around several micrometers or more. We tried to thin the RLT below 100 nm and confirmed the controllability of the RLT and its deviation in the patterned sample.", "In a first study to analyze the feasibility of Electron Beam Induced Deposition (EBID) for creating certain patterns in advanced lithography, line patterns were fabricated on silicon wafers using EBID. The growth conditions were such that the growth rate is fully determined by the electron flux (the current limited growth regime). It is experimentally verified that different patterning strategies, such as serial versus parallel patterning and single pass patterning versus multiple pass patterning, all lead to the same result in this growth regime. Images of EBID lines, imaged in a scanning electron microscope, were analyzed to determine the position of the lines, the width of the lines and the line edge roughness (LER). The results are that the lines have an average width of 13.7 nm, an average standard deviation of 1.6 nm in the center position of the lines, and an average LER of 4.5 nm (1\u03c3 value). As an example of the capabilities of EBID a logicresembling lithography pattern was fabricated.", "The Vistec VB3001 Gaussian electron-beam lithography system at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) in Albany routinely exposes 300 mm wafers to meet the requirements of nano-patterning for metrology and process tool qualification. CNSE and Vistec are partners in a continuous throughput improvement program. The second set of upgrades from this program has recently been implemented on CNSE\u2019s VB300 and includes an increase in the maximum exposure clock frequency to 100 MHz and corresponding improvements to the sub-field deflection and beam blanker. To quantify the improvements, we have used an established suite of benchmark patterns2 to compare throughput \u201cbefore and after\u201d. These benchmark patterns show an average throughput improvement factor of 4 times over the timings at the start of the continuous improvement program.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) is a promising technique for extending conventional lithographic techniques by being able to print features with critical dimensions under 10 nm. The most widely studied block copolymer system is polystyreneblock- polymethyl methacrylate (PS-b-PMMA). The system is well understood in terms of its synthesis, properties and performance in DSA. However, PS-b-PMMA also has a number of limitations that impact on its performance and hence scope of application. The primary limitation is the low Flory-Huggins polymer-polymer interaction parameter (\u03c7), which limits the size of features that can be printed by DSA. Another issue with block copolymers in general is that specific molecular weights need to be synthesized to achieve desired morphologies and feature sizes. We are exploring blending ionic liquid additiveswithPS-b-PMMAto increase the \u03c7 parameter. This allows smaller feature sizes to be accessed by PS-b-PMMA. Depending on the amount of additive it is also possible to tune the domain size and the morphology of the systems. These findings may expand the scope of PS-b-PMMA for DSA.", "Implementation of directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) introduces a series of engineering challenges that have not been completely addressed in previous block copolymer and lithography studies. One of the required innovations for further DSA development and implementation is the accurate simulation of specific block copolymer chemistries and their interactions with interfaces. Many of the BCP simulation tools developed so far have limitations or difficulty in terms of matching many of the common issues found in experimental BCP systems such as polydispersity and different statistical segment lengths. One of the potentially most important issues is the fact that real BCPs often have block energy and/or density asymmetry, meaning that each block has a different homopolymer density and/or cohesive energy density (CED). A simulation of BCP behavior and DSA processes based on molecular dynamics (MD) of coarse-grained polymer chains has been developed that can independently parameterize and control the density and CED of each block to more accurately match the asymmetry found in experimental BCPs. This model was used to study the effect of block asymmetry on the order-disorder transition (ODT), domain scaling, and self-assembly of thin films of BCPs. BCPs whose blocks each have a different density show deviations from the mean-field ODT coexistence curve, exhibiting an order-disorder transition or co-existence curve that is asymmetric with shifts and tilts in the direction of majority highest density block. This impact of density and cohesive energy differences diblock copolymers on their phase behavior can explain some of the unexpected shapes found experimentally in BCP ODT curves. Asymmetry in the BCP block energy or density does not appear to have a significant effect on domain scaling behavior compared to the mean-field estimates. Self-assembly of thin films of BCPs with mismatches in CED shows significant deviations in the expected morphologies from ones simulated using equivalent densities and cohesive energy densities. The lowest CED block has a strong propensity to segregate to and \u201cwet\u201d the free interface at the top of the film because it has the lowest energy penalty for the loss of interactions with other chains at the free surface relative to the bulk. This gives rise to an effective \u201cskinning\u201d of the film by the lowest CED block for almost the entire potential range of underlayer compositions and film thicknesses. Such materials will be extremely difficult to successfully pattern transfer for a lithographically useful process because they will not form vertically aligned morphologies through the entire film thickness. This CED mismatch also gives rise to a large number of non-bulk morphologies and deviations from bulk behavior including changing vertical-to-horizontal morphologies through film depth, compression and expansion of domain sizes to match film thickness dimensions, and island and hole formation among others. Increasing the \u03c7N value can potentially suppress some of these non-idealities due to CED asymmetry, but the required \u03c7N to overcome these issues will differ from polymer to polymer depending on the magnitude of the CED asymmetry.", "The properties of cylindrical poly(styrene-b-methylmethacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) BCPs self-assembly in thinfilms are studied when the pure BCPs are blended either with a homopolymer or with another cylindrical PS-b-PMMA based BCP. For both of these approaches, we show that the period of the self-assembled features can be easily tuned and controlled, and that the final material presents interesting characteristics, such as the possibility to achieve thicker defects-free films, as compared to pure block-copolymers having the same period. Moreover, a statistical defectivity study based on a Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi analysis of the self-assemblies made with the different blends is described, and prove that despite their high value of polydispersity index, these blends exhibit also improved selfassembly properties (bigger monocrystalline arrangements and enhanced kinetics of defects annihilation) as compared to pure and monodisperse block-copolymers. Finally, the behavior of the blends is also compared to the ones their pure counter-part in templated approach like the contact-hole shrink to evaluate their respective process-window and response toward this physical constrain for lithographic applications.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is one of candidate for next generation patterning technique. Many good demonstrations of DSA have been reported using polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b- PMMA) these days. On the other hands, BCPs which show high chi parameter are being developed because the BCPs can be formed smaller features than PS-b-PMMA. Si-containing BCPs are one of them. Moreover Si-containing BCPs show higher etch selectivity than PS-b-PMMA because of higher etch resistance of Si-containing block. Unfortunately, while Si-containing BCPs can be aligned by solvent annealing, they but cannot be aligned perpendicular to the substrate by thermal annealing. Because Si-containing block which has low surface energy achieves maximum interaction with air interface by forming a top parallel wetting layer to the substrate. One solution to control of surface energy on top surface is the use of Top-Coat (TC). It has been already demonstrated that TC with Si-containing BCP could form perpendicular pattern. The challenges are TC coating onto BCP film and TC stripping after annealing. In order to solve these problems, polarity-changeable type TC has been developed. The effect of TC materials to generate finger print of BCP has been reported. However, this TC process should combine with DSA process to form aligned patterns. Graphoepitaxy is one of the DSA technique to align BCP pattern using guide pattern. In this technique, the characteristic of guide pattern side wall is very important to control BCP pattern alignment for the Graphoepitaxy process. Also, in order to establish the process, there are two key parameters for the materials. One is BCP and guide pattern should have enough resistance to TC solvent through TC coating process. The other is TC can be removed easily with basic aqueous solution before BCP patterning. In this report, a detail of examination for TC Graphoepitaxy process will be discussed.", "Careful control and reproducibility of BCP\u2019s synthesis are mandatory parameters to push-down PS-b-PMMA block-copolymer systems toward its lowest dimensions for microelectronic applications. The self-assembly process optimization of different high-resolution cylindrical PS-b-PMMA block-copolymers (i.e. L0 period below 25 nm) is studied to highlight processes-variations as regard to more classical PS-b-PMMA systems while the characterizations of bulk materials provide deeper insights on the parameters addressing the self-assembly of such materials. The integration of a high-resolution BCP on 300 mm track is then studied to check the capabilities of such materials in terms of lithographic applications. CD uniformity measurements in contact hole shrink approach, as well as the transfer of the BCP mask into typical industrial under-layer stacks leading to aggressive features, show that these materials exhibit promising potentials for advanced lithographic nodes.", "The lithographic requirements for the thin film head industry are comparable to the semiconductor industry for certain parameters such as resolution and pattern repeatability. In other aspects such as throughput and defectivity, the requirements tend to be more relaxed. These requirements match well with the strengths and weaknesses reported concerning nanoimprint lithography (NIL) and suggest an alternative approach to optical lithography. We have demonstrated the proof of concept of using NIL patterning, in particular Jet and FlashTM Imprint Lithography (J-FILTM) 1 , to build functional thin film head devices with performance comparable to standard wafer processing techniques. An ImprioTM 300 tool from Molecular Imprints, Inc. (MII) was modified to process the AlTiC ceramic wafers commonly used in the thin film head industry. Templates were produced using commercially viable photomask manufacturing processes and the AlTiC wafer process flow was successfully modified to support NIL processing. Future work is identified to further improve lithographic performance including residual layer thickness uniformity, wafer topography, NIL\u2192NIL overlay, and development of a large imprint field that exceeds what is available in optical lithography.", "Imprint lithography has been shown to be an effective technique for replication of nano-scale features. Jet and Flash Imprint Lithography (J-FIL) involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. Non-fill defectivity must always be considered within the context of process throughput. Processing steps such as resist exposure time and mask/wafer separation are well understood, and typical times for the steps are on the order of 0.10 to 0.20 seconds. To achieve a total process throughput of 20 wafers per hour (wph), it is necessary to complete the fluid fill step in 1.0 seconds, making it the key limiting step in an imprint process. Recently, defect densities of less than 1.0/cm2 have been achieved at a fill time of 1.2 seconds by reducing resist drop size and optimizing the drop pattern. There are several parameters that can impact resist filling. Key parameters include resist drop volume (smaller is better), system controls (which address drop spreading after jetting), Design for Imprint or DFI (to accelerate drop spreading) and material engineering (to promote wetting between the resist and underlying adhesion layer). In addition, it is mandatory to maintain fast filling, even for edge field imprinting. This paper addresses the improvements made with reduced drop volume and enhanced surface wetting to demonstrate that fast filling can be achieved for both full fields and edge fields. By incorporating the changes to the process noted above, we are now attaining fill times of 1 second with non-fill defectivity of ~ 0.1 defects/cm2.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a promising method for producing the sub-20nm features required for future semiconductor device scaling, but many questions still surround the issue of defect levels in DSA processes. Knowledge of the free energy associated with a defect is critical to estimating the limiting equilibrium defect density that may be achievable in such a process. In this work, a coarse grained molecular dynamics (MD) model is used to study the free energy of a dislocation pair defect via thermodynamic integration. MD models with realistic potentials allow for more accurate simulations of the inherent polymer behavior without the need to guess modes of molecular movement and without oversimplifying atomic interactions. The free energy of such a defect as a function of the Flory- Huggins parameter (\u03c7) and the total degree of polymerization (N) for the block copolymer is also calculated. It is found that high pitch multiplying underlayers do not show significant decreases in defect free energy relative to a simple pitch doubling underlayer. It is also found that \u03c7N is not the best descriptor for correlating defect free energy since simultaneous variation in chain length (N) and \u03c7 value while maintaining a constant \u03c7N product produces significantly different defect free energies. Instead, the defect free energy seems to be directly correlated to the \u03c7 value of the diblock copolymer used. This means that as higher \u03c7 systems are produced and utilized for DSA, the limiting defect level will likely decrease even though DSA processes may still operate at similar \u03c7N values to achieve ever smaller feature sizes.", "Today\u2019s soaring complexity in pushing the limits of 193nm immersion lithography drives the development of other technologies. One of these alternatives is mask-less massively parallel electron beam lithography, (MP-EBL), a promising candidate in which future resolution needs can be fulfilled at competitive cost. MAPPER Lithography\u2019s MATRIX MP-EBL platform has currently entered an advanced stage of development. The first tool in this platform, the FLX 1200, will operate using more than 1,300 beams, each one writing a stripe 2.2\u03bcm wide. 0.2\u03bcm overlap from stripe to stripe is allocated for stitching. Each beam is composed of 49 individual sub-beams that can be blanked independently in order to write in a raster scan pixels onto the wafer.", "Reflective electron-beam lithography (REBL) employs a novel device to impress pattern information on an electron beam. This device, the digital pattern generator (DPG), is an array of small electron reflectors, in which the reflectance of each mirror is controlled by underlying CMOS circuitry. When illuminated by a beam of low-energy electrons, the DPG is effectively a programmable electron-luminous image source. By switching the mirror drive circuits appropriately, the DPG can \u2018scroll\u2019 the image of an integrated circuit pattern across its surface; and the moving electron image, suitably demagnified, can be used to expose the resist-coated surface of a wafer or mask. This concept was first realized in a device suitable for 45 nm lithography demonstrations. A next-generation device has been designed and is presently nearing completion. The new version includes several advances intended to make it more suitable for application in commercial lithography systems. We will discuss the innovations and compromises in the design of this next-generation device. For application in commercially-practical maskless lithography at upcoming device nodes, still more advances will be needed. Some of the directions in which this technology can be extended will be described.", "The characteristics of a prototype massively parallel electron beam direct writing (MPEBDW) system are demonstrated. The electron optics consist of an emitter array, a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) condenser lens array, auxiliary lenses, a stigmator, three-stage deflectors to align and scan the parallel beams, and an objective lens acting as a reduction lens. The emitter array produces 10000 programmable 10 \u03bcm square beams. The electron emitter is a nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) ballistic electron emitter array integrated with an active matrix driver LSI for high-speed emission current control. Because the LSI also has a field curvature correction function, the system can use a large electron emitter array. In this system, beams that are incident on the outside of the paraxial region of the reduction lens can also be used through use of the optical aberration correction functions. The exposure pattern is stored in the active matrix LSI\u2019s memory. Alignment between the emitter array and the condenser lens array is performed by moving the emitter stage that slides along the x- and y-axes, and rotates around the z-theta axis. The electrons of all beams are accelerated, and pass through the anode array. The stigmator and the two-stage deflectors perform fine adjustments to the beam positions. The other deflector simultaneously scans all parallel beams to synchronize the moving target stage. Exposure is carried out by moving the target stage that holds the wafer. The reduction lens focuses all beams on the target wafer surface, and the electron optics of the column reduces the electron image to 0.1% of its original size.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) via chemo-epitaxy is a potential lithographic solution to patterns of dense features. The LiNe (Liu-Nealey) flow was used to fabricate the chemical pattern, which guides the BCP due to the different wetting behavior of the materials. Fine control of both the chemical pattern chemistry and geometry are important for DSA of BCP. Furthermore, wetting behavior considerations for DSA extend beyond pattern design and include the surrounding region. BCP DSA would be easier to integrate into device design if the patterned region were isolated with a featureless region (horizontal lamellar BCP assembly) rather than undirected BCP fingerprint structures. This paper addresses two processing steps found to be modifying the guide material. For one, the backfill brush grafts to the cross-linked polystyrene (XPS), albeit at a lower rate than the brush grafts to the exposed substrate. Undersaturating the backfill brush only moderately improves the XPS wetting behavior, but also negatively impacts the background region of the chemical pattern. Replacing the brush grafting functionality so that the brush grafts at lower annealing conditions also did not avoid the side reaction between the brush and the XPS. The other step modifying the XPS is the trim etch. Replacing the trim etch process was effective at generating a chemical pattern that can orient the BCP horizontally on a stripe 11 L0 wide passing through a field of chemical pattern.", "Pattern density multiplication using directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a technique capable of producing patterns with small pitches utilizing guiding template patterns printed as larger feature sizes and pitches. One method for achieving this density multiplication is to utilize chemoepitaxy based on a guiding underlayer that is nominally topographically flat but which is composed of a pinning region, or stripe if referring to lamellae, which will chemically prefer one microphase of the BCP, as well as a second region that is often referred to as \u201cneutral\u201d to both phases of the BCP. In most conceptions of such a chemoepitaxial approach for alignment of lamellae patterns, the pinning stripe is typically the width of a single lamellae of the phase separated BCP, while the neutral stripe is some odd number of lamellae widths. In this work, detailed simulation studies have been performed to elucidate the effects of variables such as guiding stripe size, chemical composition of the neutral stripes, and small topography on the process window of DSA pitch sub-division patterning processes. A simple but novel technique has been developed and utilized to quantify the level of alignment of a simulated BCP film to an underlying guiding pattern. Such process windows and lithographic parameters have been studied for different pitch sub-division conditions including 1:3 and 1:5 pinning stripe:neutral stripe width ratios. It is found that the center of the processing window occurs at a composition of the \u201cneutral stripe\u201d such that it is slightly to somewhat strongly preferential to the type of polymer of opposite type to that attracted by the pinning stripe, and that this ideal \u201cneutral stripe\u201d composition becomes more neutral as the density multiplication increases.", "The directed self-assembly (DSA) of diblock copolymers in laterally confining channels is a promising avenue to produce line-and-space patterns with a sub-25 nm pitch. In this study, we use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate the DSA of both cylinder- and lamella-forming diblock copolymers in narrow trenches with corrugated sidewalls. Specifically, we focus on systems that form lying-down cylinder monolayers or standing-up lamellae parallel to the sidewalls of the channel. While previous experimental and computational studies highlighted well-ordered cylinders and lamellae in smooth channels, undesirable defective structures are also observed. In the present study, the wetting sidewalls of the channels are no longer planar surfaces. Rather, we consider undulating sidewalls and investigate the effect of the rough surfaces on defectivity and line edge roughness (LER) in the self-assembled morphologies. We use SCFT to investigate the formation free energy of isolated, meta-stable defects of both cylindrical and lamellar block copolymers inside channels with sinusoidal corrugations along the sidewalls. Parametric studies include the effects of the amplitude and the frequency of the sinusoidal wall shape function, the placement of the defect core, as well as the number of cylinders and lamellae in channels of varying widths. Our simulations indicate that the relative decreases in defect formation energy in rough channels compared to smooth channels are strikingly similar in both cylinder- and lamella-forming melts. Furthermore, using a suitable order parameter and the center-to-center displacement of the self-assembled lines, our complex Langevin (CL) simulations (beyond SCFT) show that the propagation of the LER is sensitive to the amplitude and the wavelength of the sidewall shape function, with an even stronger dependence in the lamellar case compared to the cylindrical case. More broadly, our study reveals the dependence of line edge roughness propagation on a wide range of parameters that must be carefully controlled in order to successfully implement a directed self-assembly process with block copolymers.", "The nanoimprint lithography (NIL) process with its key elements molding and thin film pattern transfer refers to the established process chain of resist-based patterning of hard substrates. Typical processes for mass-fabrication are either fast wafer-like substrate imprint or to continuous foils by roll-to-roll processes. In contrast to this, similar process chains were established for polymeric micro-elements fabricated by injection molding, particularly when surface topographies need to be integrated into monolithic polymer elements. NIL needs to be embedded into the framework of general replication technologies, with sizes ranging from nanoscopic details to macroscopic entities. This contribution presents elements of a generalized replication process chain involving NIL and demonstrates its wide application by presenting a non-typical NIL product such as an injection molded micro-cantilever. Additionally a hybrid approach combining the NIL and injection molding in a single tool is presented. Its aim is to introduce the toolbox approach for nanoreplication into NIL-based processing and to facilitate the choice of suitable processes for micro- and nanodevices. By proposing a standardized process flow as described in the NaPANIL Library of Processes, the use of establish process sequences for new applications will be facilitated.", "For making sub-10nm patterns, new lithography technology is proposed in this paper. This is a cost-effective new lithography process using the special organic material which is able to reduce a pattern size by shrinking. Shrinking ratio of various methods, decreasing line edge roughness (LER) and patterning of less than 10nm half pitch size are reported.", "The graphoepitaxy DSA process relies on lithographically created confinement wells to perform directed self-assembly in the thin film of the block copolymer. These self-assembled patterns are then etch transferred into the substrate. The conventional DUV immersion or EUV lithography is still required to print these confinement wells, and the lithographic patterning residual errors propagate to the final patterns created by DSA process. DSA proximity correction (PC), in addition to OPC, is essential to obtain accurate confinement well shapes that resolve the final DSA patterns precisely. In this study, we proposed a novel correction flow that integrates our co-optimization algorithms, rigorous 2-D DSA simulation engine, and OPC tool. This flow enables us to optimize our process and integration as well as provides a guidance to design optimization. We also showed that novel RET techniques such as DSA-Aware assist feature generation can be used to improve the process window. The feasibility of our DSA correction framework on large layout with promising correction accuracy has been demonstrated. A robust and efficient correction algorithm is also determined by rigorous verification studies. We also explored how the knowledge of DSA natural pitches and lithography printing constraints provide a good guidance to establish DSA-Friendly designs. Finally application of our DSA full-chip computational correction framework to several real designs of contact-like holes is discussed. We also summarize the challenges associated with computational DSA technology.", "Application of the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymer (PS-b-PMMA) to the hole shrink process has gained large attention because of the low cost and the potential for sub-lithographic patterning of contact, via and cut masks (Ref. [1-2] and references therein). In order to realize the DSA hole shrink process for manufacturing, however, one still has to resolve a few critical issues such as morphological defects and placement errors [3]. The morphological defect here indicates the PS residual layer lying between the vertical PMMA cylinder and the substrate, which prevents the PMMA cylinder from touching to the bottom surface. Such underlying defects cannot be observed by conventional approach with the top-down SEM images. In this study, we have utilized a simplified model, so-called the Ohta- Kawasaki (OK) model [4-5] to optimize the DSA hole shrink process. The advantages of the OK model are considerably low computational expense and reasonable accuracy. First, we demonstrated that the OK model could indeed predict complicated, three-dimensional morphologies of the diblock copolymer in the pre-patterned hole. All the results were computed within one minute, and they were reasonably comparable to those obtained from the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) [6]. Then, we calibrated the model parameters with the cross-sectional TEM images, minimizing the errors between the simulated thickness of PS residual layer and the experimental data. The calibrated model was used for the optimization of the guide hole shape and for the exploration of the multi-cylinder case.", "An electrical test vehicle for fabricating direct self-assembly (DSA) sub-30 nm via interconnects has been fabricated employing a soft mask grapho-epitaxy contact-hole shrink. The generation of the resist pre-pattern was carried out using 193i lithography on three different stacks and the BCP assembly was evaluated with and without template affinity control on the resist pre-pattern. After DSA shrink, the holes were transferred in a 100 nm oxide for standard Tungsten metallization for electrical characterization.", "We have investigated the directed self-assembly (DSA) of cylinder-forming block copolymers inside cylindrical guiding templates. To complement and corroborate our experimental study, we use field-theoretic simulations to examine the fluctuations-induced variations in the size and position of the cylindrical microdomain that forms in the middle of the guiding hole. Our study goes beyond the usual mean-field approximation and self-consistent field theory simulations (SCFT) and incorporates the effects of thermal fluctuations in the description of the self-assembly process using complex Langevin (CL) dynamics. In both our experimental and modeling efforts, we focus on minor-block-attractive sidewalls and bottom substrates and neutral top surfaces and explore the properties of the formed cylinders, including fluctuations in the center position and the size of the domain, for various prepattern conditions. Our results indicate robust critical dimensions (CD) of the DSA cylinders relative to the incoming CD, with a sigma CD < 0.9nm. Likewise, we find that the DSA cylinders are accurately registered in the center of the guiding hole, with deviations in the hole-inhole distance on the order of \u2248 0.7-1nm, translating to errors in the hole-to-hole distance of \u2248 1-1.5nm.", "Contact hole (CH) patterning by directed-self-assembly (DSA) of polystyrene-b-polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) block copolymers (BCPs) is extensively studied in this paper. Based on statistical analysis performed on 300mm wafers, a process window (PW) for CH shrink is experimentally evaluated in terms of hole open yield and critical dimension (CD) variation after DSA as a function of BCPs of different natural periods and guiding patterns of different dimensions. The PW allowed us to define the suitable BCP molecular weight with the best guiding CD ranges required to achieve a desired DSA hole CD within a specific tolerance. As example, for a DSA hole CD targeted at 19.5 nm with 10% tolerance, circular guiding patterns of 52 nm CD with 20% guiding CD latitude are needed using a 35nm-natural-period BCP. It is also shown that the CH shrink PW is dependent on guiding pattern pitch and on DSA process conditions such as the self-assembly annealing and spin coating conditions. In addition, the study highlights an interesting property of commensurability between guiding pattern dimensions and BCP\u2019s natural period that governs the CH patterning by DSA for both CH shrink and CH doubling configurations. This permits to predict the guiding pattern dimensions needed for CH patterning by DSA using a given BCP of known natural period.", "Directed self-assembly of block copolymers is currently being investigated as a shrinking technique complementary to lithography. One of the critical issues about this technique is that DSA induces the placement error. In this paper, study of the relation between confinement by lithography and the placement error induced by DSA is demonstrated. Here, both 193i and EUV pre-patterns are created using a simple algorithm to confine two contact holes formed by DSA on a pitch of 45nm. Full physical numerical simulations were used to compare the impact of the confinement on DSA related placement error, pitch variations due to pattern variations and phase separation defects.", "In recent years, the reduction in pattern size is driving the rapid adoption of nanoimprint lithography (NIL). Since nanoimprinting since is contact printing, a higher separation force might damage the master and/or the imprint tool, either of which degrades pattern quality. One of the biggest concerns in NIL utilization is the mold-release characteristic of the master and the resin. Although Optool DSXTM (DAIKIN Ind. Ltd.) is a de facto standard as mold release reagent, there is a problem with its UV-NIL durability. Accordingly, we focused on developing new fluorinated low molecular weight perfluorocompounds to enhance the mold-release characteristic of the resist. This paper reports that resists containing these fluroinated compounds offer improved durability as antistick layers for quartz molds subjected to repeated UV-NIL exposure.", "As a new scheme of a master-mold (imprint-mask) fabrication, half pitch (hp) 12nm lines and spaces (L/S) pattern was fabricated from hp 24nm L/S resist mandrels, which was prepared by EB writing as well as nanoimprinting, and followed by self-aligned double-pattering (SADP) technique. It was observed that line width roughness (LWR, 3 sigma value) was reduced and improved by a single and multiple nanoimprinting to make hp24nm resist mandrels in the new scheme. We have studied the phenomena and then revealed that the resist patterns of nanoimprinting had more sharp and smooth shoulders as well as bottom edges than EB resist patterns. Those seemed to be reflected to better LWR and LWR reduction by nanoimprinting. The new scheme has advantages of resolution enhancement and better pattern quality of LWR on a mold (mask) for nanoimprint lithography, with comparing to a conventional and single EB lithography.", "A structure and method for coating Nano Imprint Lithography (NIL) masks is described. The approach uses conformal ALD layering methods and sequential monomolecular depositions. The processes describe chemically bonded, high density, smooth coatings having fractional fluorine terminations. Various molecular precursor mixtures or various reactive surface site chemical functionalization schemes allow the attainment of controlled percentages of fractional F-terminations. The percentage of fluorine terminations is adjustable and controllable from 0% to 100%. Chemistries are described that result in coating layers of the order of ~1nm. These fractional F-terminated coatings may be useful for the reduction and minimization of defects in advanced imprint lithography processes.", "The presented work deals with molecular glass resist materials based on (i) calix[4]resorcinarene resist systems, (ii) twisted fully aromatic biscarbazole-biphenyl materials, and (iii) fully aromatic spiro resist materials as new promising materials for Scanning Probe Lithography (SPL). Because of the non-chemically amplified resist nature and the absence of corresponding material diffusion, the novel SPL resists have the potential to increase the patterning resolution capabilities at a simultaneous reduction of the edge roughness (LER). In addition, these low molecular weight molecular glasses offer the advantage of solvent-free film preparation by physical vapor deposition (PVD). The PVD prepared films offer a number of advantages compared to spin coated ones such as no more pinholes, defects, or residual solvent domains, which can locally affect the film properties. These high-quality PVD films are ideal candidates for the direct patterning by SPL tools. Presented highlights are the thermal scanning probe lithography (tSPL) investigations at IBM Research - Zurich and the patterning by using electric field, current controlled scanning probe lithography (EF-CC-SPL) at the Technical University of Ilmenau. Further investigations on film forming behavior, etch resistance, and etch transfer are presented. Owing to the high-resolution probe based patterning capability in combination with their improved etch selectivity compared to reference polymeric resists the presented molecular glass resists are highly promising candidates for lithography at the single nanometer digit level.", "Photoinhibited superressolution (PInSR) lithography is a two--color, one-photon scheme that promises high throughput far-field patterning t deep subwwabvelength scales. Previous work ha shown that the technique susceptible to blurring from active species diffusion, an issue which we have recently overcome with the use of a low-diffiusivity methrylate resist. Here we present out first clear demonstration of superresolution, showing feature spacing 3X better than the 0.2 NA diffraction limit.", "KLA-Tencor is currently developing Reflective Electron Beam Lithography (REBL), targeted as a production worthy multiple electron beam tool for next generation high volume lithography. The Digital Pattern Generator (DPG) integrated with CMOS and MEMS lenslets is a critical part of REBL. Previously, KLA-Tencor reported on progress towards a REBL tool for maskless lithography below the 10 nm technology node. However, the MEMS lenslet structure suffered from charging up during writing, requiring the usage of a charge drain coating. Since then, the TSMC multiple e-beam team and the KLA-Tencor REBL team have worked together to further develop the DPG for direct write lithography. In this paper, we introduce a hollow-structure MEMS lenslet array that inherently prevents charging during writing, and preliminary verification results are also presented.", "Due to resolution limitation of 1.35NA 193nm immersion lithography, double-exposure and double-patterning (DP) are widely used in 20nm logic process. We propose to replace these DP layers with multi e-beam lithography, i.e. combining two photo masks into one e-beam exposure layer. Our analysis suggests that current multi e-beam tool has the resolution capability to expose these combined layers. The major concern is the mix-and-match overlay, which should be addressed by further improvement of alignment hardware and establishment of an advanced process control system. We believe that the mixing of e-beam and photolithography offers an alternative lithography solution for manufacturing 20nm logic products in small volume.", "As the feature size of LSI shrinks, the cost of mask manufacturing and turn-around-time continue to increase. Maskless lithography using electron beam direct writing (EBDW) technology attracts attention. On the other hands, with continuous scaling and the introduction of low-k dielectrics in Cu interconnect technology, reliability degradation caused by time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and electromigration has become important issues. Therefore, EBDW in backend process is needed to ensure superior patterning quality and reliability using high-accuracy proximity effect correction (PEC). We have already proposed a dose-modification strategy of EBDW considering reliability for TDDB degradation. In this paper, furthermore, we propose a shape-modification strategy of EBDW considering circuit performance in LSI interconnects for improving EB drawing throughput. We use effectively patterns with rounded corner in order to reduce EB shots increased by PEC and avoid the local high current density at the corner of metal lines. We applied the proposed method to a microprocessor layout synthesized with the Nangate 45nm Open Cell Library. As a result, the drawn pattern by corner rounding and coarse dose adjustment achieved 2.5% higher throughput than that by no corner rounding and fine dose adjustment.", "At the 7 nm technology node, the contact layers of integrated circuits (IC) are too dense to be printed by single exposure lithography. Block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) has shown its advantage in contact/via patterning with high throughput and low cost. To pattern contacts with DSA, guiding templates are usually printed first with conventional lithography, e.g., 193 nm immersion lithography (193i) that has a coarser pitch resolution. Contact holes are then patterned with DSA process. The guiding templates play the role of controlling the DSA patterns inside, which have a finer resolution than the templates. The DSA contact pitch depends on the chemical property of block copolymer and it can be adjusted within a certain range under strong lateral confinement to deviate from the natural pitch. As a result, different patterns can be obtained through different parameters. Although the guiding template shapes can be arbitrary, the overlay accuracy of the contact holes patterned are different and largely depend on the templates. Thus, the guiding templates that have tolerable variations are considered as feasible, and those have large overlays are considered as infeasible. To pattern the contact layer in a layout with DSA technology, we must ensure that all the DSA templates in the layout are feasible. However, the original layout may not be designed in a DSA-friendly way. Moreover, the routing process may introduce contacts that can only be patterned by infeasible templates. In this paper, we propose an optimization algorithm that optimize the contact layer for DSA patterning in 1D standard cell design. In particular, the algorithm modifies the layout via wire permutation technique to redistribute the contacts such that the use of infeasible templates is avoided and the feasible patterns that with better overlay control are favored. The experimental result demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm in helping to reduce the design and manufacturing cost of a DSA-enabled process at 7 nm technology node.", "In this report, morphology of cylinders by block copolymer (BCP) in the corner rounded rectangle guide patterns is analyzed by simulation and compared with experimental results. In the case of the hole-multiplication, selection the guide pattern size and the affinity of wall and under layer is necessary for stable micro structure. To search the good guide conditions, Ohta-Kawasaki (OK) model and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) are used. OK model is well known as low cost simulation method, therefore it is expected to use for searching the good guide area roughly from wide range. DPD is one of the strong candidates for DSA simulation, and it is used for prediction of the micro structure. As results, the guide size area which has two PMMA cylinders by 2D OK model seems consistent with experimental results, 3D micro structure by OK model and DPD are comparable, 3D simulations have good agreements with experimental results observed by CD-SEM and STEM. Especially two cylinders connected each other at some point predicted by 3D simulation is observed actually. These simulation approaches will be important to decide the lithography mask design, film stack and pre-treatment conditions for more complex multiplication process, for example, the cut mask application.", "We use self-consistent field theory to investigate the self-assembly of AB diblock copolymers on chemically patterned substrates. The striped substrates consist of attractive domains alternating with neutral ones. Using our simulations, we observe the formation of different self-assembled morphologies in the polymer film and compute their formation free energy for various pattern widths and wetting conditions. We found that perpendicular lamellae are best formed when the A-attractive stripes have a width near half the natural lamellar period in bulk, but lamellar structures with wide bases are also formed in wide stripes. We also computed the formation energy of isolated dislocations and found that the energy cost is \u2248 50-110kT for \u00b115nm deviations from optimal commensurability conditions.", "The approaches to improve the performance of the DSA (directed self-assembly) computational models are being reviewed and discussed. We start by reviewing the computational complexity of a rigorous self-consistent field theory (SCFT) DSA model and also the currently utilized ways to reduce this computational complexity and improve its performance, as implemented in GLOBALFOUNDRIES DSA Solver. We proceed with presenting new approximations in the SCFT model making it possible to improve the computational performance of the DSA model further.", "Ordered microstructures with nanometrically defined periodicity offer promising opportunities in microelectronic applications for the production of advanced CMOS digital logic circuits. To produce the features and arrays inherent to such technologies, the combination of the \u201cbottom-up\u201d block copolymer self-assembly with \u201ctop-down\u201d guiding templates has been successfully introduced leading to new technological breakthroughs. Among the materials used in the direct self-assembly methodology, poly(styrene-b-methylmethacrylate) systems have reached an unprecedented level of maturity which will lead to their introduction into the next technological nodes. However, this system suffers from deficiencies such as a low Flory Huggins parameter (X = 0.04 at 25\u00b0C) and a low chemical contrast as regards to the etching processes which could be problematic for targeting sub-22 nm features. Consequently we have developed new systems based on Si-containing block copolymers which are characterized by high segregation strength as well as strong chemical etching contrast. In this contribution, we focus on a poly(lactic acid) / poly(dimethylsiloxane) system exhibiting a cylindrical mesostructure. By controlling the surface energy at the interface between the substrate and the block copolymer domains, we show the possibility to control the orientation of the mesostructure with a methodology comparable to the one used for poly(styrene) / poly(methyl methacrylate) system but with random copolymers having distinct monomers than the block copolymers.", "We proposed a new concept of \u201cdefect-aware process margin.\u201d Defect-aware process margin was evaluated by investigating the energy difference between the free-energy of the most stable state and that of the first metastable state. The energy difference is strongly related to the defect density in DSA process. As a result of our rigorous simulations, the process margin of the pinning layer width was found to be: (1) worse when the pinning layer affinity is too large, (2) better when the background affinity has the opposite sign of the pinning layer affinity, and (3) better when the top of the background layer is higher than that of the pinning layer by 0.1L0.", "We use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to study shape rectification in overlapped cylindrical and non-cylindrical prepatterns. Specifically, we examine the potential of directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers to not only reduce critical dimensions relative to the template, but also repair defects in the guiding prepatterns and produce defectfree contact holes. In our study over a wide range of prepattern dimensions, we found that defects in the central minorblock domain arise with decreasing center-to-center distance of the prepattern. Increasing the minor-block fraction in the block copolymer was observed to remove some of the defects. We also studied the effect of adding homopolymer to the block copolymer melt and show how blends can successfully eliminate defects and increase the range of the process window relative to the neat diblock case without influencing domain properties such as the critical dimension and the hole-to-hole distance.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) is today a credible alternative lithographic technology for semiconductor industry [1]. In the coming years, DSA integration could be a standard complementary step with other lithographic techniques (193nm immersion, e-beam, extreme ultraviolet). Its main advantages are a high pattern resolution (down to 10nm), a capability to decrease an initial pattern edge roughness [2], an absorption of pattern guide size variation, no requirement of a high-resolution mask and can use standard fab-equipment (tracks and etch tools). The potential of DSA must next be confirmed viable for high volume manufacturing. Developments are necessary to transfer this technology on 300mm wafers in order to demonstrate semiconductor fab-compatibility [3-7]. The challenges concern especially the stability, both uniformity and defectivity, of the entire process, including tools and Blok Co-Polymer (BCP) materials. To investigate the DSA process stability, a 300mm pilot line with DSA dedicated track (SOKUDO DUO) is used at CEALeti. BCP morphologies with PMMA cylinders in a PS matrix are investigated (about 35nm natural period). BCP selfassembly in unpatterned surface and patterned surface (graphoepitaxy) configurations are considered in this study. Unpatterned configuration will initially be used for process optimization and fix a process of record. Secondly, this process of record will be monitored with a follow-up in order to validate its stability. Steps optimization will be applied to patterned surface configurations (graphoepitaxy) for contact hole patterning application. A process window of contact hole shrink process will be defined. Process stability (CD uniformity and defectivity related to BCP lithography) will be investigated.", "A multifunctional hardmask neutral layer (HM NL) was developed to improve etch resistance capabilities, enhance reflectance control, and match the surface energy properties required for polystyrene block copolymers (PS-b-PMMA). This HM NL minimizes the number of substrate deposition steps required in graphoepitaxy directed self-assembly (DSA) process flows. A separate brush layer is replaced by incorporating neutral layer properties into the hardmask to achieve microphase separation of BCP during thermal annealing. The reflection control and etch resistance capabilities are inherent in the chemical composition, thus eliminating the need for separate thin film layers to address absorbance and etch criteria. We initially demonstrated successful implementation of the HM NL using conventional PS-b-PMMA. A series of BCP formulations were synthesized with L0 values ranging from 28 nm to 17 nm to test the versatility of the HM NL. Quality \u201cfingerprint\u201d patterns or microphase separation using 230\u00b0-250\u00b0C annealing for 3-5 minutes was achieved for an array of modified BCP materials. The HM NL had water contact angles at 78\u00b0-80\u00b0 and polarities in the 5-6 dyne/cm range. The scope of BCP platform compositions evaluated consists of a 20\u00b0 water contact angle variance and a 10-dyne/cm range in polarities. All BCP derivatives were coated directly onto the HM NL followed by thermal annealing followed by SEM analysis for effective \u201cfingerprint\u201d patterns. We offer a simplified alternative path for high etch resistance in a graphoepitaxy DSA flow employing a single-layer hardmask for etch resistance demonstrated to be compatible with diverse BCP-modified chemical formulations.", "Directed self-assembly of PS-b-PMMA during laser spike annealing at peak temperatures of 300-800\u00b0C for dwells of 1- 10 ms has been explored. The enhanced mobility of polymer chains at these temperatures improves registration compared to conventional thermal anneals. PS-b-PMMA films (forming 15 nm line/space standing lamellae) were cast on chemically patterned substrates with a copolymer neutral layer and annealed by laser and hot-plate (2 minutes 250\u00b0C). Annealing by hot plate or multiple laser scans resulted in well-aligned features over micron length scales. By laser annealing multiple times, defectivity can be reduced by ~60%. However, laser annealing for only 10 ms before performing a hot plate anneal reduced defectivity by ~80%. Additionally, defects are more often localized as dislocation pairs rather than regions perpendicular to the underlying directing pattern resulting in far greater total alignment.", "Line edge roughness (LER) influencing the electrical performance of circuit components is a key challenge for electronbeam lithography (EBL) due to the continuous scaling of technology feature sizes. Controlling LER within an acceptable tolerance that satisfies International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors requirements while achieving high throughput become a challenging issue. Although lower dosage and more-sensitive resist can be used to improve throughput, they would result in serious LER-related problems because of increasing relative fluctuation in the incident positions of electrons. Directed self-assembly (DSA) is a promising technique to relax LER-related pattern fidelity (PF) requirements because of its self-healing ability, which may benefit throughput. To quantify the potential of throughput improvement in EBL by introducing DSA for post healing, rigorous numerical methods are proposed to simultaneously maximize throughput by adjusting writing parameters of EBL systems subject to relaxed LER-related PF requirements. A fast, continuous model for parameter sweeping and a hybrid model for more accurate patterning prediction are employed for the patterning simulation. The tradeoff between throughput and DSA self-healing ability is investigated. Preliminary results indicate that significant throughput improvements are achievable at certain process conditions.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) is considered as a potential patterning solution for future generation devices. One of the most critical challenges for translating DSA into high volume manufacturing is to achieve low defect density in the DSA patterning process. The defect inspection capability is fundamental to defect reduction in any process, particularly the DSA process, as it provides engineers with information on the numbers and types of defects. While the challenges of other candidates of new generation lithography are well known (for example, smaller size, noise level due to LER etc.), the DSA process causes certain defects that are unique. These defects are nearly planar and in a material which produces very little defect scattering signal. These defects, termed as \u201cdislocation\u201d and \u201cdisclination\u201d have unique shapes and have very little material contrast. While large clusters of these unique defects are easy to detect, single dislocation and disclination defects offer considerable challenge during inspection. In this investigation, etching the DSA pattern into a silicon (Si) substrate structure to enhance defect signal and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is studied. We used a Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA) method for solving Maxwell\u2019s equations to simulate the DSA unique defects and calculate inspection parameters. Controllable inspection parameters include various illumination and collection apertures, wavelength band, polarization, noise filtering, focus, pixel size, and signal processing. From the RCWA simulation, we compared SNR between \u201cPost-SiN etch\u201d and \u201cPost-SiN+Si-substrate etch\u201d steps. The study is also extended to investigate wafer-level data at post etch inspection. Both the simulations and inspection tool results showed dramatic signal and SNR improvements when the pattern was etched into the SiN+Si substrate allowing capture of DSA unique defect types.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a promising method for producing the sub-20nm features required for future semiconductor device scaling, but many questions still surround the issue of defect levels in DSA processes. Knowledge of the free energy associated with a defect is critical to estimating the limiting equilibrium defect density that may be achievable in such a process. In this work, a coarse grained molecular dynamics (MD) model is used to study the free energy of a dislocation pair defect via thermodynamic integration. MD models with realistic potentials allow for more accurate simulations of the inherent polymer behavior without the need to guess modes of molecular movement and without oversimplifying atomic interactions. The free energy of such a defect as a function of the Flory- Huggins parameter (\u03c7) and the total degree of polymerization (N) for the block copolymer is also calculated. It is found that high pitch multiplying underlayers do not show significant decreases in defect free energy relative to a simple pitch doubling underlayer. It is also found that \u03c7N is not the best descriptor for correlating defect free energy since simultaneous variation in chain length (N) and \u03c7 value while maintaining a constant \u03c7N product produces significantly different defect free energies. Instead, the defect free energy seems to be directly correlated to the \u03c7 value of the diblock copolymer used. This means that as higher \u03c7 systems are produced and utilized for DSA, the limiting defect level will likely decrease even though DSA processes may still operate at similar \u03c7N values to achieve ever smaller feature sizes.", "The patterning potential of block copolymer materials via various directed self-assembly (DSA) schemes has been demonstrated for over a decade. At cost-effective low printing doses, extreme ultra-violet lithography (EUVL) suffers from shot noise effects while patterning sub 30 nm contact hole dimensions. As the critical dimension (CD) of DSA systems is largely determined by polymer dimensions, it is theoretically expected that the local CD uniformity (LCDU) of EUVL pre-patterns can be improved by the DSA of pitch matched block co-polymers. In this work we demonstrate continued improvements on our previously reported chemo-epitaxy DSA integration flow. Also, we achieve dense arrays of contact holes via 3x and 4x frequency multiplication of EUVL patterned contact hole arrays.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of various polymers is a potential next-generation lithography component. Lithographers can use an ArF scanner to print guide structures with pitches accessible with current technology. The DSA materials, in a non-exposure step, perform pitch multiplication of 1-D and 2-D guide structures. While research has investigated defects inherent to the DSA material, ArF scanner effects have received little attention. This work uses DSA models and scanner models to assess requirements for ArF immersion scanners for DSA complimentary lithography.", "In detailed routing for integrated circuit (IC) designs, vias are usually randomly inserted in order to connect between di erent routing layers. In the 7 nm technology node and beyond, the wire pitch is below 40 nm, and consequently, the vias become very dense, making via layer printing a challenging problem. Recently block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) technology has demonstrated great advantages for via layer patterning using guiding templates. To pattern vias with DSA process, guiding templates are usually printed rst with conventional lithography, e:g:, 193 nm immersion lithography (193i) that has a coarser pitch resolution. Then the guiding templates will guide the placement of the DSA patterns (e:g:, vias) inside, and these patterns have a ner resolution than the templates. Di erent template shapes have di erent control on the overlay accuracy of the inside vias. By performing DSA experiments, the guiding templates can be classi ed as feasible and infeasible templates according to the overlay requirement of the technology node. The templates that meet the overlay requirement are feasible templates, and other templates are infeasible. Without considering the DSA template constraints in detailed routing, randomly distributed vias may require infeasible templates to be patterned, which makes the via layers incompatible with the DSA process. In this paper, we propose a DSA-aware detail routing algorithm to optimize the via layers such that only feasible templates are needed for via layer patterning. In addition, among all the feasible templates, the one with better overlay accuracy has higher priority to be picked up by the router for via patterning, which further improves the yield. By enabling DSA process for via layer patterning in the 7 nm technology node, the proposed detailed routing strategy tremendously reduces the manufacturing cost and improves the throughput for IC fabrication.", "Chemoepitaxy is often used to induce pattern density multiplication in the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) by using a chemically patterned guiding underlayer. This underlayer is often viewed as being a flat underlayer composed of a pinning stripe region and a neutral stripe region, where the pinning stripe is a region highly preferential to one phase of the BCP and the neutral stripe is a region that is slightly preferential to the other phase of the BCP that is not attracted by the pinning stripe. However, in producing these chemoepitaxial patterns, it is likely that unexpected topography might be introduced into the system, which may adversely affect the ability for the underlayer to guide the phase separation of the BCP film, and may deform any resulting lamellae. The current work presented in this paper explores the effect that topography in these chemoepitaxial underlayers has on the alignment of the BCP film. These underlayer effects have been evaluated using detailed mesoscale molecular dynamics simulations.", "In this study, we have investigated how to link \u201dlarge-scale simulations with the simplified models\u201d to \u201dmesoscale simulations with the detailed models.\u201d For the simplified model, we have applied so-called the generalized Ohta-Kawasaki (gOK) model. Our simulation flow was implemented by two steps: 1) parallel computations of block copolymer annealing with the simplified model, 2) detailed analysis of the defects with the SCFT. The local volumetric densities of block copolymers calculated by the simplified models were used as an input for the SCFT. Then the SCFT simulations were performed under the constraints in which the density field was driven to be the one obtained from the simplified model. Using the resultant partition functions, we were able to obtain spatial distributions of the free chain ends and the connection points of the blocks. Note that the chain conformation of block copolymer is an important, but missing component of the simplified models; this multi-scale approach is expected to be useful for further understanding the origin and stability of DSA defects.", "We proposed the DSA simulation technique which is the combined method of two dimensional (2D) SCF and three dimensional (3D) dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) methods by using the density biased Monte Carlo method. This combined method has advantages of both an accuracy of SCF and fast and stably-working simulation of 3D DPD methods regardless of the strong segregation regime. Using our techniques, several results, such as DSA film structure on the chemical guide, are obtained. We also discuss the availability of our simulation technique using our free software, OCTA (in detail, see http://octa.jp) system.", "In emerging high-vacuum multi e-beams exposure tools, the release of hydrocarbonaceous species (precursor) by resists outgassing is unavoidable and leads to premature contamination of optics projection systems. In this work, we present an experimental methodology aiming at resist outgassing qualification. A specific experimental setup was designed to monitor the induced outgassing phenomena by irradiating resist coated on 100mm silicon wafer. The wafer can be exposed through specific silicon micromachined membranes (called mimics) that are representative of the optics projection system usually embedded in real multi e-beam exposure tools. A Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS) is plugged into the vacuum chamber and enables in-situ analysis of the by-products outgassing. Combining this tool with the Thermo Desorption - Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectroscopy (TD-GC-MS) analysis, we could not only determine the outgassing amount of different resists but also identify all the outgassed by-products and their origin. Finally, the Focus Ion Beam combined to Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) characterization techniques were used to determine the contamination layer thickness and elementary composition, respectively. A first process oriented conclusion from this work shows that the use of a thin topcoat layer can considerably reduce the resist outgassing amount and, consequently, the hydrocarbonaceous contamination layer induced on the mimics. The outgassing amount as well as the top-coat efficiency was shown to be mainly dependent on the resist chemical properties. The contamination layer growth was shown to be dependent on e-beam current density and hydrocarbon pressure in the vicinity of the mimics.", "The shape and dimensions of a challenging pattern have been measured using a model-based library scanning electron microscope (MBL SEM) technique. The sample consisted of a 4-line repeating pattern. Lines were narrow (10 nm), asymmetric (different edge angles and significant rounding on one corner but not the other), and situated in a complex neighborhood, with neighboring lines as little as 10 nm or as much as 28 nm distant. The shape cross-section determined by this method was compared to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and critical dimension small angle x-ray scattering (CD-SAXS) measurements of the same sample with good agreement. A recently-developed image composition method was used to obtain sharp SEM images, in which blur from vibration and drift were minimized. A Monte Carlo SEM simulator (JMONSEL) produced a model-based library that was interpolated to produce the best match to measured SEM images. Three geometrical and instrument parameterizations were tried. The first was a trapezoidal geometry. In the second one corner was significantly rounded. In the last, the electron beam was permitted to arrive with stray tilt. At each stage, the fit to the data improved by a statistically significant amount, demonstrating that the measurement remained sensitive to the new parameter. Because the measured values represent the average unit cell, the associated repeatabilities are at the tenths of a nanometer level, similar to scatterometry and other area-averaging techniques, but the SEM\u2019s native high spatial resolution also permitted observation of defects and other local departures from the average.", "In this paper, Frontier Semiconductor will introduce a new technology that is referred to as Virtual Interface Technology (VIT\u2122). VIT\u2122 is a Fourier domain technique that utilizes temporal phase shear of the measurement beam. The unique configuration of the sensor enables measurement of wafer and bonded stack thicknesses ranging from a few microns to millimeters with measurement repeatability ~ nm and resolution of approximately 0.1% of nominal thickness or depth. We will present data on high aspect ratio via measurements (depth, top critical dimension, bottom critical dimension, via bottom profile and side wall angle), bonded wafer stack thickness, and Cu bump measurements. A complimentary tool developed at FSM is a high resolution \u03bcRaman spectrometer to measure stress-change in Si lattice induced by Through Silicon Via (TSV) processes. These measurements are important to determine Keep-Out-Zone in the areas where devices are built so that the engineered gate strain is not altered by TSV processing induced strain. Applications include via post-etch; via post fill, and bottom Cu nail stress measurements. The capabilities of and measurement results from both tools are discussed below.", "At 1X node, 3D FinFETS raise a number of new metrology challenges. Gate height and fin height are two of the most important parameters for process control. At present there is a metrology gap in inline in-die measurement of these parameters. In order to fill this metrology gap, in-column beam tilt has been developed and implemented on Applied Materials V4i+ top-down CD-SEM for height measurement. A low tilt (5\u00b0) beam and a high tilt (14\u00b0) beam have been calibrated to obtain two sets of images providing measurement of sidewall edge width to calculate height in the host. Evaluations are done with applications in both gate height and fin height. TEM correlation with R2 being 0.89 and precision of 0.81nm have been achieved on various in-die features in gate height application. Fin height measurement shows less accuracy (R2 being 0.77) and precision (1.49 nm) due to challenges brought by fin geometry, yet still promising as first attempt. Sensitivity to DOE offset, die-to-die and in-die variation is demonstrated in both gate height and fin height. Process defect is successfully captured from inline wafers with gate height measurement implemented in production. This is the first successful demonstration of inline in-die gate height measurement for 14nm FinFET process control.", "A new SEM technology is becoming available that allows image-based 3D profile metrology of nanoscale features. Using patented multi-channel detector technology, this system can acquire information of surface concave and convex features, and sidewall angle (SWA) and height of profiles, quickly and non-destructively for nanoscale structures such as fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs), using electron beam technology with its well-known long probe lifetime, stability and small probe size. Here we evaluate this new technology and demonstrate its applicability to contemporary advanced structures such as FinFETs, including not only CD, but also profile, SWA, top corner rounding (TCR) and bottom corner rounding (BCR).", "3D integration technology offers an alternative to traditional packaging designs. In traditional Moore\u2019s law scaling, features are added to the die, with graphics, memory control and logic coprocessors all integrated onto the silicon chip. TSV (through silicon via) processing utilizes vertical electrical interconnects that provide the shortest possible path to establish an electrical connection from the device side to the backside of a die. This indirectly allows continues \u201cMoore\u201d- like scaling while only affecting the device packaging. White light interferometry (WLI) has been used for the measurement of topography, step height and via depth using its short coherence length. The nanometer level resolution of this technique is ideal for TSV measurements in the high aspect ratio vias. In this work, six white light interferometer measurements for TSV processing are discussed along with the importance of these measurements to TSV processing, namely: 1. Post-TSV etch: depth, top CD (TCD) and bottom CD (BCD) 2. Post-TSV liner BCD 3. Post-TSV barrier seed BCD 4. TSV electro-chemically plated (ECP) copper bump step height 5. Post-annealing bump step height 6. TSV CMP dishing These measurement steps have been implemented in-line for advanced technology node TSV process flows at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. The measurements demonstrate 90% correlation to reference metrology and <0.5% repeatability. Cross section SEM was used as a reference for TSV profile and Cu bump measurements while AFM was used as a reference for dishing measurements.", "Line-edge roughness (LER) and linewidth roughness (LWR) in lithography are best characterized by the roughness power spectrum density (PSD), or similar measures of roughness frequency and correlation. The PSD is generally thought to be described well by three parameters: standard deviation, correlation length, and roughness exponent. The next step toward enabling these metrics for pertinent industrial use is to understand how real metrology errors interact with these metrics and what should be optimized on the critical dimension scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) to improve error budgets. In this work, Java Monte Carlo Simulator of Secondary Electrons (JMONSEL) simulation is used to better understand how various SEM parameters, beam size/shape, and sample profile influence SEM line edge uncertainty and also some of the systematic shifts in edge location assignment. A thorough understanding of the impact of the SEM on the measurement results enables better measurement of LER PSD and better interpretation of measurement results.", "A new Monte Carlo code is presented that includes among others definition of arbitrary geometries with sub-nanometer resolution, high performance parallel computing capabilities, trapped charge, electric field calculation, electron tracking in electrostatic field, and calculation of 3D dose distributions. These functionalities are efficiently implemented thanks to the coupling of the Monte Carlo simulator with a TCAD environment. Applications shown are the synthesis of SEM linescans and images that focus on the evaluation of the impact of proximity effects and self charging on the quantitative extraction of critical dimensions in dense photoresist structures.", "We have proposed a new method for correcting electron beam (EB)-induced photoresist shrinkage in two-dimensional pattern contours extracted from a scanning electron microscope image. This method restores the original shrinkage-free contour from the experimentally determined \u201cshrunk contour\u201d, based on a shrinkage model which takes into account of the elastic nature of the shrinkage phenomena caused by the photoresist-volume reduction. Verification of this shrinkage model was demonstrated by using ArF resist patterns as follows. First, the model was calibrated with the shrinkage data of several line patters with different linewidth prior to the contour correction. Next, the amount of shrinkage of elbow patterns was measured by comparing its contours obtained with small and sufficiently large EB dosages. It was found that the shrinkage of the inner edge of the elbow corner was smaller than that of the outer edge, which can be interpreted as a result of the elastic deformation. Finally, validity of shrinkage correction was examined. The model calculation correctly reproduced the observed shrinkage including its dependence on the location in the pattern. The restored contour showed a good consistency with the experimental results and the total root-mean-square error of the shrinkage correction was 0.5 nm. This result confirmed that our shrinkage model adequately describes the shrinkage of two dimensional patterns. Consequently, proposed shrinkage correction method is expected to improve the accuracy of contour measurements by a critical dimension-scanning electron microscope.", "Systematic understanding of the mechanism of secondary-electron (SE) emission is important to simulate an SEM image of a high-aspect-ratio (AR) structure. The simulation technique for a high-AR structure is useful for optimizing the observation conditions of SEM. Trench patterns with AR between 0.5 and 8 were fabricated on the same substrate, and dependence of SE yield on AR of the trench patterns was determined from SEM images for several landing energies of primary electrons. In addition, to understand the SE emission inside a trench, Monte-Carlo simulation of the signal intensity for Si was performed. The SEM observations and simulation results indicate that SEM image contrast at the bottom of a trench improves with decreasing landing energy (owing to a positive charging effect) and that reflection of SEs at the sidewall of a trench is essential for accurately estimating SE emission for the high-AR structure with AR over eight.", "We investigated off-line metrology for LER determination in low-dose SEM images to reduce the acquisition time and the risk of shrinkage. Our first attempts are based on filtering noisy (experimental) SEM images and use peak detection to measure the edge displacements and calculating the discrete PSD. However, the result of the filtering is that the power spectrum of the filter leaks into the PSD. So it is better to avoid a filter at all. We subsequently developed a method to detect edge displacements without the use of a filter. This method considers the signal profile of a SEM by integrating an experimental image of lines in the direction of the edges. The signal profile of an isolated edge is modeled as two merged Gaussians. This signal profile is then fitted against the raw (unfiltered) data of the edge pattern using an interior trust-region-reflective minimization procedure. This gives the edge displacements without the use of a filter and a filter-free version of the discrete PSD is obtained. The determination of edge displacements without the use of a filter, enables us to study how much noise is acceptable and still determine LER. To answer this question we generate random lines using the model of Palasantzas and the algorithm of Thorsos. This gives random generated edge displacements for typical values of experimental lines for the parameters of the model: 2 \u03bcm long lines (256 pixels), a correlation length \u03be of 25 nm and a roughness exponent of 0.75. A noise-free top-down SEM-like image of lines is created by shifting the profile signal according to the random generated edge displacements. The image is further processed by adding Poisson-distributed noise. We consider three noise cases where the average electron density is about 2, 20 and 200 electrons per pixel. This corresponds to a charge density of (in respective order) 10 \u03bcC/cm2, 100 \u03bcC/cm2 and 1000 \u03bcC/cm2. The edge displacements of the random generated images are determined using our new developed filter-free displacement detection. The difference between the random generated displacements and the detected displacements (after adding Poisson-distributed noise) shows how pixel noise translates to noise in edge displacements. We conclude from running many simulations that this pixel noise translates to a noise in the edge displacements which is uniform (flat line) in the PSD. This means that pixel noise is classified as white noise in the edge displacements. Finally, we study simulated discrete PSDs as a function of the number of averages and analyze the convergence of the parameters (\u03c3, \u03c3n, \u03be and \u03b1) of the Palasantzas model extended with a white noise term. One of the conclusions is that a very noisy image with 12 lines and about 2 electrons per pixel on average (charge density \u2248 10 \u03bcC/cm2) already produces an estimation for LER with a relative error of about 10%.", "Topographic profiles are reconstructed from top-view images in scanning electron microscope (SEM) by predicting a local slope angle based on how surface roughness (morphology) looks from top-view. Careful analysis of Line edge roughness (LER) reveals that LER obtained in top-view SEM images is decomposed into three components, parallel shift, cross-sectional shape deformation, and surface roughness, and the local slope angle of pattern surface is estimated from the surface roughness component, which corresponds to the projection of surface roughness onto the substrate plain. Cross-sectional profiles reconstructed by scanning this procedure across top-view SEM images showed good agreements with the results obtained by other metrology methods such as an atomic force microscope.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) shows considerable promise as a cost-effective manufacturing technique for advanced sub-20 nm patterning. Along with continued progress, the patterning process requires advances in both CD metrology and high-speed characterization of DSA defectivity. This work is a report on the study of Mueller matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry (MMSE) scatterometry measurements of 28 nm pitch DSA line/space patterns consisting of polystyrene-block- polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) block copolymer sample fabricated using a chemical epitaxy process. Generalized ellipsometric data (all 16 Mueller elements) is collected over a spectral range from 245 to 1700 nm for various different pre-pattern pitch/guide strip combinations created by modulating the pre-pattern photoresist CD. Scatterometry is used to evaluate and calculate the CD, line shapes, and thicknesses of the plasma developed PS patterns (PMMA removed). Likewise, spectral comparisons based on anisotropy and depolarization are used to determine the DSA pattern defectivity. CD-SEM metrology and imaging is also conducted as a comparative metric for scatterometry. The sensitivity of MMSE to pre-pattern pitch and pitch multiplication on PS line CD and defectivity is demonstrated. Slight imperfections in the line/space pattern as well as fingerprint like patterns (undirected assembly) can be distinguished from aligned patterns using MMSE scatterometry.", "One of the major challenges associated with insertion of a directed self-assembly (DSA) patterning process in high volume manufacturing (HVM) is finding a non-destructive, yield-compatible, consistent critical dimension (CD) metrology process. Current CD scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) top-down approaches do not give the profile information for DSA patterns, which is paramount in determining the subsequent pattern transfer process (etch, for example). SEMATECH, in cooperation with some of the leaders of the metrology and DSA materials supply chain, has led an effort to address such metrology challenges in DSA. We have developed and evaluated several techniques (including a scatterometry-based method) that are potentially very attractive in determining DSA pattern profiles and have embedded bridging in such patterns without resorting to destructive cross-section imaging. We show how such processes could be fine-tuned to enable their insertion for DSA pattern characterization in an HVM environment.", "Evaluating pattern sensitivity to variability of the process parameters is of increasing importance to improve resolution enhancement techniques. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to extract printed shapes from SEM images, a novel quality metric which analyzes the topology of the extracted printed shapes with respect to the target mask shape and a unique set of descriptors that define the sensitivity of a pattern. Compared to traditional CD methods, the proposed method has better accuracy, increased robustness and ability to spot global changes. Compared to contours distance methods, it is designed to expose most critical regions and capture context effects.", "The quest to create robust control solutions for Photolithography processes is an ongoing matter. Over the past few decades several threaded and non-threaded Run-to-Run (RtR) control solutions have been introduced addressing various specific Lithography process control requirements. With continually shrinking semiconductor technology nodes, greater interdependencies are being observed between processes requiring more complex control solutions that rely on increasing process context. With higher product mixes, associated metrology costs add to this growing complexity in using existing control solutions effectively. A new dynamic RtR control solution approach in GLOBALFOUNDRIES high mix manufacturing environment offering coverage to all Lithography process steps in Fab8 has been architected and implemented. This approach not only addresses the issues caused in most commonly used \u2018Threaded\u2019 and \u2018Non-Threaded\u2019 control approaches in Lithography but also offers a dynamic thread definition implementation approach.", "This paper introduces to improve inter-field CDU with on-product focus control by diffraction based focus (DBF) method. For DBF target selection, a robust focus metrology for focus control was obtained, and the selected DBF target was integrated on each seven spot of a product reticle. For on-product focus control, previously on-product focus monitoring was performed, and the monitored lots showed a stable focus fingerprint. Based on the result, Z and Z/ Rx/Ry corrections per field on wafers were applied. Focus uniformity of controlled wafers was improved up to 29% in comparison with non-corrected ones. To demonstrate the improvement of inter-field CDU, Full CDs on wafers were measured by SEM. As a result, inter-field CDU for controlled wafers was improved by 16% (3\u03c3) compared with noncontrolled wafers.", "In order to meet current and future node overlay, CD and focus requirements, metrology and process control performance need to be continuously improved. In addition, more complex lithography techniques, such as double patterning, advanced device designs, such as FinFET, as well as advanced materials like hardmasks, pose new challenges for metrology and process control. In this publication several systematic steps are taken to face these challenges.", "This paper will explore the possibilities of critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) metrology at sub- 10 nm feature sizes using modeling. JMONSEL simulations will be used to illustrate SEM waveforms for very small features, as a function of beam energy, feature size, profile height and sidewall angle. It will also be shown that the dimensions of the electron beam and interaction volume have very strong influence on the results. Using modeled results, an assessment on required image quality for future tools will be presented, along with a framework for linking spot size and image resolution. Additionally, from the generated waveforms, various measurement algorithms will be evaluated for such future nanometer-scale applications.", "The most decent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can provide image magnification up to 500kX which seems to be suitable to image semiconductor devices for the advanced technology nodes. However, SEM images at such a high magnification often suffer from the drift and space related displacement errors, potentially causing image blur and distortion. To circumvent this, we apply the super-resolution (SR) technique to enhance the resolution of the CD-SEM metrology by using the advanced signal processing algorithms. The resolution enhancement can be realized by exploiting the multiple low resolution (LR) images that include unique information of an imaging target by looking at a slightly different position. We experimentally demonstrate image quality improvement gained by the SR technique after correcting the time-dependent drift/displacement and mapping estimated information onto the high resolution (HR) pixel grid with the non-linear pixel interpolation scheme. In addition, estimating the time-dependent drifts of the wafer position could be useful to investigate the drift properties of the CD-SEM tool.", "We developed a new measurement method enabling to quantitatively and accurately evaluate 2D pattern shapes, which becomes critical in patterning control of Metal layer patterns transferred by Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch (LELE) process. In LELE, a split patterning of a Metal-A (MA) layer and a Metal-B (MB) layer makes patterning control more challenging. Hence, it is essential to evaluate the shape of transferred patterns after final etching in order to verify that the patterning control of MA and MB layer patterns is performed within an allowable budget. For this, our Pattern Shape Quantification (PSQ) method [1][2][3], which enables to measure dimensional difference of the transferred pattern shape from their target-design, is an effective metrology. Patterns transferred through a LELE process contain the effects of two types of shape modifications. The first is the fidelity of the individual pattern shapes (e.g. pattern-end pull-back or push-out) whose determinative factors are adopted design (e.g. OPC and SRAF), process condition (of e.g. lithography and etching), etc. The second is the shift in position between MA and MB patterns induced by Pattern Placement Error (PPE) of MB with respect to MA. That means that the edge-placement errors (EPE) in the final pattern are not only due to the fidelity of the transferred pattern shape, but are also impacted by the PPE. Also, a space between MA and MB patterns will be affected by the PPE as well. A failure to maintain a required minimum space between patterns could lead to a leak-current between patterns (and hence directly affect device performance), so it is important that the PPE can be measured accurately. Therefore, we developed a method to measure local PPE in actual device patterns, from CD-SEM images, that also outputs a pattern-contour in which this PPE has been removed. Utilizing such a pattern-contour into the PSQ method enables to quantitatively determine the fidelity of transferred pattern shape solely induced by the 1st shape modification, while providing PPE data from the device patterns themselves. We believe that a high-quality patterning control (by e.g. optimization of process condition) of MA and MB can be performed only by using such a measurement result. This paper demonstrates and discusses the capability and effectiveness of our newly developed method.", "In this paper technology of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) surface metrology using arrays of piezoresistive thermally actuated cantilevers is discussed. The cantilever architecture presented here makes it possible to image surface topography using sensors operating in parallel. In this way the throughput of the sample imaging is increased, which is of crucial importance in measurements of large area samples. Application of piezoresistive detection scheme makes it possible to investigate quantitatively the interaction between the microprobe and the imaged surface. Integration of the thermal deflection actuator with the spring beam decreases the response time and enables fast and high resolution control of the tip sample distance. The results of topography parallel measurement using 1\u00d74 cantilever array will be presented.", "The aim of the semiconductor industry to decrease the feature size of integrated circuits poses a huge technological endeavor. Consequently, new challenges are arising for metrology on structures in the nanometer regime. Scatterometry is a fast method which provides non-contact non-destructive characterization of structures on photomasks or exposed wafers. However, the determination of important line structure parameters with subnanometer accuracy still needs further investigation. Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) is a scatterometry technique to measure both vertical and lateral structural features in the nanometer range with high sensitivity. We apply GISAXS to the investigation of structural parameters such as period length, sidewall angle, linewidth and height on silicon gratings. Our test structures with nominal widths of 35 nm to 100 nm and a pitch from 100 nm to 250 nm were fabricated by electron beam lithography. The diffraction patterns have been analyzed by power spectral density analysis which directly yields periodical modulations of the structured surface such as line width or groove width. We also apply a finite element method (FEM) to the diffraction peak intensity of the grating structure obtained with GISAXS for the geometric reconstruction of the line shape.", "Controlling overlay errors resulting from wafer processing, such as film deposition, is essential for meeting overlay budgets in future generations of devices. Out-of-plane distortions induced on the wafer due to processing are often monitored through high-resolution wafer geometry measurements. While such wafer geometry measurements provide information about the wafer distortion, mechanics models are required to connect such measurements to overlay errors, which result from in-plane distortions. The aim of this paper is to establish fundamental connections between the out-ofplane distortions that are characterized in wafer geometry measurements and the in-plane distortions on the wafer surface that lead to overlay errors. First, an analytical mechanics model is presented to provide insight into the connection between changes in wafer geometry and overlay. The analytical model demonstrates that the local slope of the change in wafer shape induced by the deposition of a residually stressed film is related to the induced overlay for simple geometries. Finite element modeling is then used to consider realistic wafer geometries and assess correlations between the local slope of the wafer shape change induced by the deposition of a stressed film and overlay. As established previously, overlay errors only result when the stresses in the film are non-uniform, thus the finite element study considers wafers with several different nonuniform residual stress distributions. Correlation between overlay and a metric based on a corrected wafer slope map is examined. The results of the modeling and simulations are discussed and compared to recently published experimental results.", "As design rule of semiconductor decreases continuously, overlay error control gets more and more important and challenging. It is also true that On Product Overlay (OPO) of leading edge memory device shows unprecedented level of accuracy, owing to the development of precision optics, mechanic stage and alignment system with active compensation method. However, the heating of reticle and lens acts as a dominant detriment against further improvement of overlay. Reticle heating is more critical than lens heating in current advanced scanners because lens heating can be mostly compensated by feed-forward control algorithm. In recent years, the tools and technical ideas for reticle heating control are proposed and thought to reduce the reticle heating effect. Nevertheless, it is not still simple to predict the accurate heating amount and overlay. And it is required to investigate the parameters affecting reticle heating quantitatively. In this paper, the reticle pattern density and exposure dose are considered as the main contributors, and the effects are investigated through experiments. Mask set of various transmittance are prepared by changing pattern density. After exposure with various doses, overlay are measured and analyzed by comparing with reference marks exposed in heating free condition. As a result, it is discovered that even in the case of low dose and high transmittance, reticle heating is hardly avoidable. It is also shown that there is a simple relationship among reticle heating, transmittance and exposure dose. Based on this relationship, the reticle heating is thought to be predicted if the transmittance and dose are fixed.", "The introduction of double and triple patterning tightened the Overlay current nodes\u2019 specifications across the industry to levels of 5nm and 3nm respectively. Overlay error is a combination of Intra-field and field-to-field errors. The Intra-field error includes several systematic signatures, such as overlay magnitude differences between X and Y axes, field center vs edge and more. The recent developments in scanner technology improved the intra-field Overlay to high orders. In this work we have quantified the state-of-the-art residual overlay errors and applied the RegC\u00ae (registration/overlay control) process, a new solution of deep sub-nanometer pattern shift, to further improve the overlay process control, in addition to the current lithography\u2019s state-of-the-art capabilities. As a result we managed to reduce the baseline overlay error by more than one nanometer and reduced systematic intrafield non-uniformities, by removing the 3 sigma difference between X and Y to zero. The combination of intra-field control by RegC\u00ae with high order correction per exposure (CPE) by the scanner provides a new era of overlay control required for the 2x and 1x multiple patterning processes.", "We have previously introduced a new data analysis method that more thoroughly utilizes scattered optical intensity data collected during defect inspection using bright-field microscopy. This volumetric approach allows conversion of focus resolved 2-D collected images into 3-D volumes of intensity information and also permits the use of multi-dimensional processing and thresholding techniques to enhance defect detectability. In this paper, the effects of wafer noise upon detectability using volumetric processing are assessed with both simulations and experiments using the SEMATECH 9 nm node intentional defect array. The potential extensibility and industrial application of this technique are evaluated.", "Over the past 2 years, we have developed a common optical-path, 532 nm laser epi-illumination diffraction phase microscope (epi-DPM) and successfully applied it to detect different types of defects down to 20 by 100 nm in a 22nm node intentional defect array (IDA) wafer. An image post-processing method called 2DISC, using image frame 2nd order differential, image stitching, and convolution, was used to significantly improve sensitivity of the measured images. To address 9nm node IDA wafer inspection, we updated our system with a highly stable 405 nm diode laser. By using the 2DISC method, we detected parallel bridge defects in the 9nm node wafer. To further enhance detectability, we are exploring 3D wafer scanning, white-light illumination, and dark-field inspection.", "Historically when we used to manufacture semiconductor devices for 45 nm or above design rules, IC manufacturing yield was mainly determined by global random variations and therefore the chip manufacturers / manufacturing team were mainly responsible for yield improvement. With the introduction of sub-45 nm semiconductor technologies, yield started to be dominated by systematic variations, primarily centered on resolution problems, copper/low-k interconnects and CMP. These local systematic variations, which have become decisively greater than global random variations, are design-dependent [1, 2] and therefore designers now share the responsibility of increasing yield with manufacturers / manufacturing teams. A widening manufacturing gap has led to a dramatic increase in design rules that are either too restrictive or do not guarantee a litho/etch hotspot-free design. The semiconductor industry is currently limited to 193 nm scanners and no relief is expected from the equipment side to prevent / eliminate these systematic hotspots. Hence we have seen a lot of design houses coming up with innovative design products to check hotspots based on model based lithography checks to validate design manufacturability, which will also account for complex two-dimensional effects that stem from aggressive scaling of 193 nm lithography. Most of these hotspots (a.k.a., weak points) are especially seen on Back End of the Line (BEOL) process levels like Mx ADI, Mx Etch and Mx CMP. Inspecting some of these BEOL levels can be extremely challenging as there are lots of wafer noises or nuisances that can hinder an inspector\u2019s ability to detect and monitor the defects or weak points of interest. In this work we have attempted to accurately inspect the weak points using a novel broadband plasma optical inspection approach that enhances defect signal from patterns of interest (POI) and precisely suppresses surrounding wafer noises. This new approach is a paradigm shift in wafer inspection by leveraging systematic defect locations for high sensitivity inspection, thereby enhancing the discovery and monitoring of yield-limiting defects at traditional optical inspection throughput.", "Scatterometry-based CD, also known as Optical CD (OCD) significantly matches CD-SEM in accuracy and precision, in addition to offering superior full-profile reconstruction. OCD, however, is computationally intensive. In this paper, we construct an extremely fast screening tool that determines whether a sample should or should not proceed to subsequent manufacturing steps. To this end we examine the diffraction signals of the grating in order to determine whether a sample is in or out of its specification limits. This allows us to allocate traditional metrology resources only on samples that show unusual behavior. Support vector machines (SVM) are trained to classify each incoming sample as in-spec or outof- spec. The constructed classifier is applied to gratings exposed with a focus-exposure matrix for a rectangular silicon- BARC-photoresist stack, which include erroneous samples with under-over exposure, necking, and bridging problems. The misclassification rates as well as false and missed alarm rates are analyzed. Results show that our prototype screening system has misclassification errors on the order of 5-10 %, while the computation time is on the order of one vector dot product.", "For sub-10nm lithography for semiconductor devices, inspection technologies for detecting nanometer size defects become quite important. In the case of optical inspection, it is difficult to detect a defect whose size is less than 23nm because of optical resolution limit. This paper describes a cost-effective inspection technology for detecting a nanometer size defect with the optical inspection technology using replicated soft template which is able to enlarge a defect size by expanding. Feasibility of detecting 9.6nm defect with optical inspection is reported.", "With the device dimensions moving towards the 1X node, the semiconductor industry is rapidly approaching the point where 10 nm defects become critical. Therefore, new methods for improving the yield are emerging, including inspection and review methods with sufficient resolution and throughput. Existing industrial tools cannot anymore fulfill these requirements for upcoming smaller and 3D features, since they are performing at the edge of their performance. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has the ability to accurately measure dimensions in the micrometer to nanometer scale. Examples of applications are surface roughness, channel height and width measurement, defect inspection in wafers, masks and flat panel displays. In most of these applications, the target area is very large, and, therefore, the throughput of the measurement plays an important role in the final production cost. Single SPM has never been able to compete with other inspection systems in terms of measurement speed, thus has not fulfilled the industry needs in throughput and cost. Further increase of the speed of the single SPM helps, but it still is far from the required throughput and, therefore, insufficient for high-volume manufacturing. Over the past three years, we have developed a revolutionary concept for a multiple miniaturized SPM heads system, which can inspect and measure many sites in parallel. The very high speed of each miniaturized SPM unit allow the user to scan many areas, each with the size of tens of micrometers, in a few seconds. This paper presents an overview of the technical developments and experimental results of the parallel SPM system for wafer and mask inspection.", "With EUV lithography on the ITRS roadmap for sub-2X half-pitch patterning, it has become increasingly essential to ramp up efforts in being able to manufacture defect-free reticles or at least ones with minimal defects initially. For this purpose, much of the focus in recent years has been in finding ways to adequately detect, characterize, and reduce defects on both EUV blanks and patterned masks. For detection purposes, the current high-resolution DUV or e-beam inspection platforms are being extended to inspect EUV blanks and patterned masks but being non-actinic, make it very challenging to assess the real impact of the detected defects on EUV plane. Even with the realization of the EUV beta AIMS\u2122 aerial-image based metrology in 2014-2015, the exact nature of each critical defect needs to be determined in order to be able to come up with an appropriate repair strategy. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of computational techniques to non-actinic supplemental metrology data collected on EUV mask defects to effectively determine the nature and also predict printability of these defects. The fundamental EUV simulation engine used in this approach is the EUV Defect Printability Simulator (DPS), which uses simulation and modeling methods designed specifically for the individual EUV mask components, and achieves runtimes several orders of magnitude faster than rigorous FDTD and RCWA methods while maintaining adequate accuracy. The EUV DPS simulator is then coupled with supplemental inspection and metrology measurements of real defects to effectively predict wafer printability of these defects. Several sources of such supplementary data are explored here, and may sometimes be dependent on the actual nature of defect. These sources include AFM height-profile data, SEM top-down images, and 193nm high-NA inspection images of single or multiple focus plane capture. From each of these supplemental data sources, the mask pattern and defect information is first extracted or recovered, and then forward-simulated in DPS to generate EUV aerial images subsequently analyzed for wafer printability. Each of the data sources have their strengths and limitations vis-\u00e0-vis use in a production pilot line. We exploit a mix and- match approach to effectively filter down to the defects that really matter. The 193nm inspection image data are readily available and although the pixel-sizes are somewhat coarse compared with the mask pattern widths, computationally predicting EUV printability off these images provides a quick filter of the obvious false and nuisance defects. SEM images on the other hand provide a much better two-dimensional top-down resolution of the patterns and hence work well for full-height excess or missing absorber defects but not so well for three-dimensional defects such as pits and bumps in the EUV multilayer or foreign material defects such as contamination. AFM height profile measurements generally provide the best available resolution on three-dimensional defects and thereby are well-suited for further simulations to EUV, however, AFM tip and image stability, and data acquisition time need to be comprehended. Computationally exploiting these supplemental defect inspection and metrology data in this mix-and-match approach effectively filters defects down to those that really matter on printed wafer. We see this approach as being vital to getting comprehensive defect learnings during the EUV pilot phase implementation and delivering well-characterized EUV masks to the wafer fab at substantially lower cost-of-ownership.", "Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) has matured into a versatile phase-contrast microscopy technique capable of producing diffraction limited images without the need for high precision focusing elements. CDI has been most appropriately applied in the EUV/X-ray region of the spectrum where imaging optics are both difficult to produce and inefficient. By satisfying basic geometric constraints (such as Nyquist sampling of scattered intensities) diffraction imaging techniques essentially replace any imaging elements with sophisticated computer algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of our CDI-based, phase-contrast EUV microscope by quantitatively imaging objects in both transmission and reflection. Patterned feature depth is obtained in transmission using keyhole coherent diffraction imaging (KCDI) and feature height is quantitatively extracted in the first general, table-top reflection mode CDI microscope.", "Integrated circuits from 22nm node and beyond utilize many innovative techniques to achieve features that are well beyond the resolution limit of 193nm immersion lithography. The introduction of complex 3D structures in device design presents additional challenges that require more sophisticated metrology with high accuracy and precision. One such example is pitch walking induced by multiple-patterning techniques. Quantification of pitch walking has traditionally been a challenge. In this paper, we present two ways of detecting pitch walking using optical and X-ray techniques. In scatterometry, this work investigates the feasibility of non-orthogonal azimuth angle spectroscopic reflectometry setups for Fin pitch walking measurements, which is useful for in-line monitoring in 14nm node microelectronics manufacturing. Simulations show a significant improvement in pitch walking sensitivity using 45 degree azimuth scan. Other relevant considerations for pitch walking modeling in scatterometry, such as parameter correlations, are also discussed. Another approach is using high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD).Which is sensitive to the crystalline films. Pitch walking is seen as additional peaks in the diffraction and the intensities can be used to quantify the pitch walking. In addition, additional information about the Fin profiles, e.g. sidewall angle, CD and height, can be obtained. Note that in HRXRD measurements, all the parameters are deconvolved from the pitch walking. In this paper, we will discuss the results from measurements using the two techniques and how the combination of the two techniques can give complete information about the fins needed for in-line monitoring.", "The capacity to measure nanoscale features rapidly and accurately is of central importance for the monitoring of manufacturing processes in the production of computer integrated circuits. Parameters of interest include, for example, trench depth, duty cycle, wall angle and oxide layer thickness. The measurement method proposed here uses focused beam scatterometry, in which the illumination consists of a focused field with a suitably tailored spatially-varying polarization distribution. In an analysis that is analogous to classical off-null measurements as well as weak measurements in quantum mechanics, we predict that four or more parameters can be measured and distinguished with an accuracy consistent with the needs laid out in the semiconductor roadmap.", "Reducing parameter correlations to enhance scatterometry measurement accuracy, precision and tool matching is a crucial component of every modeling effort. Parameter sensitivity can largely depend on the orientation of the plane of incidence relative to the grating orientation. Conventional scatterometry is done with the plane if incidence normal to the grating orientation, whereas azimuthal scatterometry allows measurements at an arbitrary angle or set of angles. A second technique examined in this paper is hybrid metrology where inputs from source tools such as CD-SEM and CD-AFM are used to determine values of critical parameters. The first examples shows LER sensitivity gains by measuring narrow resist lines in an orientation parallel with the long axis of the grating. Hybridization of LER results in a CD and SWA FMP improvement of about 60%. We also showcase the benefits of azimuthal scatterometry measuring resist lines with CD larger than the wavelengths of the incident light. A CD and SWA FMP reduction of about 60% and 30% is obtained using azimuthal scatterometry at 0, 45 and 90 degrees azimuth angles. Hybridization of the ARC SWA after RIE results in CD and resist SWA FMP improvements by over 60% and 30%, respectively.", "Monitoring and control of the various processes in the semiconductor require precise metrology of relevant features. Optical Critical Dimension metrology (OCD) is a non-destructive solution, offering the capability to measure profiles of 2D and 3D features. OCD has an intrinsic averaging over a larger area, resulting in good precision and suppression of local variation. We have studied the feasibility of process monitoring and control in AEI (after etch inspection) applications, using the same angular resolved scatterometer as used for CD, overlay and focus metrology in ADI (after develop inspection) applications1. The sensor covers the full azimuthal-angle range and a large angle-of-incidence range in a single acquisition. The wavelength can be selected between 425nm and 700nm, to optimize for sensitivity for the parameters of interest and robustness against other process variation. In this paper we demonstrate the validity of the OCD data through the measurement and comparison with the reference metrology of multiple wafers at different steps of the imec N14 fabrication process in order to show that this high precision OCD tool can be used for process monitoring and control.", "Si lattice stress at or near the surface, and overall quality of the Si surface and interface were characterized using multi-wavelength, high resolution Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Depth profiling of Si lattice stress and electrically active defects/traps, at or near the Si surface and interface, was done using ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) light sources, with different probing depths. Significant variations in Si lattice stress, Si bond lengths and electrically active defects/traps were found from Si wafers undergoing various process steps. Visualization of Si surface and interface quality was done on Si wafers following various device fabrication steps.", "Integrated metrology in the lithography cluster is a promising solution to tighten process control. It is shown that optical CD metrology using YieldStar, an angular resolved scatterometer, meets all requirements in terms of precision, process robustness, throughput and matching to CD-SEM, the current tool-of-reference. The same metrology tool supports also diffraction-based overlay metrology. Using an appropriate sampling plan and the full scanner correction capabilities, overlay control can be improved. The throughput of the integrated tool is sufficient to support high volume sampling plans for combined CD and overlay monitoring and control, with 100% lot coverage.", "The novel method of sub-nanometer uncertainty for the line width measurement and the line profile measurement using STEM (Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope) images is proposed to calibrate CD-SEM line width measurement and the standardization of line profile measurement as reference metrology. In accordance with the proposed method, we already have established the methodology of profile of Si line and photoresist feature for reference metrology. In this article, we applied the proposed method to the sidewall roughness measurement of photoresist features and line profile measurement of finFET features. Using the proposed method, specimens of photoresist feature and finFET feature are sliced as thin specimens of 100 nm thickness by FIB (Focused Ion Beam) micro sampling system. Then the cross-sectional images of the specimens are obtained by STEM and TEM. The sidewall roughness of photoresist features is estimated by the maximum slope of the image intensity graph at the edge. Then, the sidewall roughness is also measured by CD-AFM (Critical Dimension Atomic Force Microscope); we compared the results by STEM image and CD-AFM. Moreover, the line profile of finFET features is defined using TEM images for reference metrology. We compared the line width of fin measured by the proposed method and CD value by CD-SEM measurement.", "For robustness improvement of inline metrology tools, we propose inline reference metrology system \u201cVerification Metrology System (VMS)\u201d. This system combines inline metrology tools and non-destructive reference metrology tools. VMS can detect the false alarm error and the not-detectable error caused by measurement robustness decay of inline metrology tools. GI-SAXS was selected as the inline reference metrology tool. GI-SAXS has high robustness capability for under-layer structure changes. VMS with scatterometry and GI-SAXS was evaluated for measurement robustness. The potential to detect metrology system errors was confirmed using VMS. Cost reduction effect of VMS was estimated for the false alarm case. Total cost is obtained as a sum of the false alarm loss and the metrology cost. VMS is effective for total cost reduction with low sampling. And it is important that sampling frequency of reference metrology is optimized based on process qualities.", "When designing an experiment to assess the accuracy of a tool as compared to a reference tool, semiconductor metrologists are often confronted with the situation that they must decide on the sampling strategy before the measurements begin. This decision is usually based largely on the previous experience of the metrologist and the available resources, and not on the statistics that are needed to achieve acceptable confidence limits on the final result. This paper shows a solution to this problem, called inverse TMU analysis, by presenting statistically-based equations that allow the user to estimate the needed sampling after providing appropriate inputs, allowing him to make important \u201crisk vs. reward\u201d sampling, cost, and equipment decisions. Application examples using experimental data from scatterometry and critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) tools are used first to demonstrate how the inverse TMU analysis methodology can be used to make intelligent sampling decisions before the start of the experiment, and then to reveal why low sampling can lead to unstable and misleading results. A model is developed that can help an experimenter minimize the costs associated both with increased sampling and with making wrong decisions caused by insufficient sampling. A second cost model is described that reveals the inadequacy of current TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) sampling practices and the enormous costs associated with TEM sampling that is needed to provide reasonable levels of certainty in the result. These high costs reach into the tens of millions of dollars for TEM reference metrology as the measurement error budgets reach angstrom levels. The paper concludes with strategies on how to manage and mitigate these costs.", "As overlay margins shrink for advanced process nodes, a key overlay metrology challenge is finding the measurement conditions which optimize the yield for every device and layer. Ideally, this setup should be found in-line during the lithography measurements step. Moreover, the overlay measurement must have excellent correlation to the device electrical behavior. This requirement makes the measurement conditions selection even more challenging since it requires information about the response of both the metrology target and device to different process variations. In this work a comprehensive solution for overlay metrology accuracy, used by UMC, is described. This solution ranks the different measurement setups by their accuracy, using Qmerit, as reported by the Archer 500. This ranking was verified to match device overlay using electrical tests. Moreover, the use of Archer Self Calibration (ASC) allows further improvement of overlay measurement accuracy.", "Until recent device nodes, lithography has been struggling to improve its resolution limit. Even though next generation lithography technology is now facing various difficulties, several innovative resolution enhancement technologies, based on 193nm wavelength, were introduced and implemented to keep the trend of device scaling. Scanner makers keep developing state-of-the-art exposure system which guarantees higher productivity and meets a more aggressive overlay specification. \u201cThe scaling reduction of the overlay error has been a simple matter of the capability of exposure tools. However, it is clear that the scanner contributions may no longer be the majority component in total overlay performance. The ability to control correctable overlay components is paramount to achieve the desired performance.(2)\u201d In a manufacturing fab, the overlay error, determined by a conventional overlay measurement: by using an overlay mark based on IBO and DBO, often does not represent the physical placement error in the cell area of a memory device. The mismatch may arise from the size or pitch difference between the overlay mark and the cell pattern. Pattern distortion, caused by etching or CMP, also can be a source of the mismatch. Therefore, the requirement of a direct overlay measurement in the cell pattern gradually increases in the manufacturing field, and also in the development level. In order to overcome the mismatch between conventional overlay measurement and the real placement error of layer to layer in the cell area of a memory device, we suggest an alternative overlay measurement method utilizing by design, based metrology tool. A basic concept of this method is shown in figure1. A CD-SEM measurement of the overlay error between layer 1 and 2 could be the ideal method but it takes too long time to extract a lot of data from wafer level. An E-beam based DBM tool provides high speed to cover the whole wafer with high repeatability. It is enabled by using the design as a reference for overlay measurement and a high speed scan system. In this paper, we have demonstrated that direct overlay measurement in the cell area can distinguish the mismatch exactly, instead of using overlay mark. This experiment was carried out for several critical layer in DRAM and Flash memory, using DBM(Design Based Metrology) tool, NGR2170\u2122.", "As photolithography will continue with 193nm immersion multiple patterning technologies for the leading edge HVM process node, the production overlay requirement for critical layers in logic devices has almost reached the scanner hardware performance limit. To meet the extreme overlay requirements in HVM production environment, this study investigates a new integrated overlay control concept for leading edge technology nodes that combines the run-to-run (R2R) linear or high order control loop, the periodic field-by-field or correction per exposure (CPE) wafer process signature control loop, and the scanner baseline control loop into a single integrated overlay control path through the fab host APC system. The goal is to meet the fab requirements for overlay performance, lower the cost of ownership, and provide freedom of control methodology. In this paper, a detailed implementation of this concept will be discussed, along with some preliminary results.", "Shrinking wafer overlay budgets raise the importance of careful characterization and control of the contributing components, a trend accelerated by multi-patterning immersion lithography [1]. Traditionally, the mask contribution to wafer overlay has been estimated from measurement of a relatively small number of standard targets. There are a number of studies on test masks and standard targets of the impact of mask registration on wafer overlay [2],[3]. In this paper, we show the value of a more comprehensive characterization of mask registration on a product mask, across a wide range of spatial frequencies and patterns. The mask measurements will be used to obtain an accurate model to predict mask contribution to wafer overlay and correct for it.", "Overlay metrology performance as Total Measurement Uncertainty (TMU), design rule compatibility, device correlation and measurement accuracy are been challenged at 2x nm node and below. Process impact on overlay metrology becoming critical, and techniques to improve measurement accuracy becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we present an innovative methodology for improving overlay accuracy. A propriety quality metric, Qmerit, is used to identify overlay metrology measurement settings with least process impacts and reliable accuracies. Using the quality metric, an innovative calibration method, ASC (Archer Self Calibration) is then used to remove the inaccuracies. Accuracy validation can be achieved by correlation to reference overlay data from another independent metrology source such as CDSEM data collected on DCM (Device Correlated Metrology) hybrid target or electrical testing. Additionally, reference metrology can also be used to verify which measurement conditions are the most accurate. In this paper we bring an example of such use case.", "While semiconductor manufacturing is moving towards the 14nm node using immersion lithography, the overlay requirements are tightened to below 5nm. Next to improvements in the immersion scanner platform, enhancements in the overlay optimization and process control are needed to enable these low overlay numbers. Whereas conventional overlay control methods address wafer and lot variation autonomously with wafer pre exposure alignment metrology and post exposure overlay metrology, we see a need to reduce these variations by correlating more of the TWINSCAN system\u2019s sensor data directly to the post exposure YieldStar metrology in time. In this paper we will present the results of a study on applying a real time control algorithm based on machine learning technology. Machine learning methods use context and TWINSCAN system sensor data paired with post exposure YieldStar metrology to recognize generic behavior and train the control system to anticipate on this generic behavior. Specific for this study, the data concerns immersion scanner context, sensor data and on-wafer measured overlay data. By making the link between the scanner data and the wafer data we are able to establish a real time relationship. The result is an inline controller that accounts for small changes in scanner hardware performance in time while picking up subtle lot to lot and wafer to wafer deviations introduced by wafer processing.", "The NTD (Negative Tone Developer) process has been embraced as a viable alternative to traditionally, more conventional, positive tone develop processes. Advanced technology nodes have necessitated the adopting of NTD processes to achieve such tight design specifications in critical dimensions. Dark field contact layers are prime candidates for NTD processing due to its high imaging contrast. However, reticles used in NTD processes are highly transparent. The transmission rate of those masks can be over 85%. Consequently, lens heating effects result in a non-trivial impact that can limit NTD usability in a high volume mass production environment. At the same time, Source Mask Optimized (SMO) freeform pupils have become popular. This can also result in untoward lens heating effects which are localized in the lens. This can result in a unique drift behavior with each Zernike throughout the exposing of wafers. In this paper, we present our experience and lessons learned from lens heating with NTD processes. The results of this study indicate that lens heating makes impact on drift behavior of each Zernike during exposure while source pupil shape make an impact on the amplitude of Zernike drift. Existing lens models should be finely tuned to establish the correct compensation for drift. Computational modeling for lens heating can be considered as one of these opportunities. Pattern shapes, such as dense and iso pattern, can have different drift behavior during lens heating.", "Defect review is a time consuming job. Human error makes result inconsistent. The defects located on don\u2019t care area would not hurt the yield and no need to review them such as defects on dark area. However, critical area defects can impact yield dramatically and need more attention to review them such as defects on clear area. With decrease in integrated circuit dimensions, mask defects are always thousands detected during inspection even more. Traditional manual or simple classification approaches are unable to meet efficient and accuracy requirement. This paper focuses on automatic defect management and classification solution using image output of Lasertec inspection equipment and Anchor pattern centric image process technology. The number of mask defect found during an inspection is always in the range of thousands or even more. This system can handle large number defects with quick and accurate defect classification result. Our experiment includes Die to Die and Single Die modes. The classification accuracy can reach 87.4% and 93.3%. No critical or printable defects are missing in our test cases. The missing classification defects are 0.25% and 0.24% in Die to Die mode and Single Die mode. This kind of missing rate is encouraging and acceptable to apply on production line. The result can be output and reloaded back to inspection machine to have further review. This step helps users to validate some unsure defects with clear and magnification images when captured images can\u2019t provide enough information to make judgment. This system effectively reduces expensive inline defect review time. As a fully inline automated defect management solution, the system could be compatible with current inspection approach and integrated with optical simulation even scoring function and guide wafer level defect inspection.", "Nonlinearity and non-uniformity of phase-shifts significantly contribute to the error of the evaluated phase in phase-shifting interferometry. However, state of the art error-compensating algorithms can counteract the linear mis-calibration and first-order nonlinearity associated with the phase-shift. We describe an error expansion method that is utilized to construct a phase-shifting algorithm that can compensate the second-order nonlinearity and non-uniformity of phase-shifts. The conditions for eliminating the effect of second-order nonlinearity and non-uniformity of phase-shifts are given as a set of linear equations for the sampling amplitudes. We developed a novel 11-sample phase-shifting algorithm that can compensate for the second-order nonlinearity and non-uniformity of phase-shifts and is robust up to a 4th harmonic. Experimental results show that the surface shape of a transparent plate could be measured with a precision of 1 nm, over the 120-mm-diameter aperture.", "Evaluation of resist shrinkage and precision by critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) for EUV resist patterns at around 20 nm exposed by 0.33 NA EUV tool was conducted. To investigate interaction between EUV resist and electron beam, an accurate and fast measurement method of resist shrinkage was established. Our method can avoid saturation of shrinkage at large dose conditions which was a demerit in conventional method. By applying the new method, pattern size dependence of shrinkage was measured with various line and space (L/S) patterns down to 20 nm. The result shows that resist shrinkage of fine L/S EUV resist pattern largely depends on line width rather than space width. A well-known trade-off relationship between shrinkage and precision was observed for EUV resist pattern as well as ArF resist pattern. Shrinkage of 1.6 nm and precision of 0.13 nm for 18 nm EUV resist pattern were obtained at a typical CD-SEM condition. We also measured shrinkage and precision for a dense L/S pattern at various exposure focus and dose conditions using a FEM wafer to examine the impact of process variability. To investigate the influence of EUV shadowing effect, we measured them for both horizontal and vertical patterns at different slit locations in exposure field. No systematic change of shrinkage and precision was observed through exposure focus and dose in the process window across slit location for both horizontal and vertical L/S patterns.", "As leading edge lithography moves to advanced nodes in high-mix, high-volume manufacturing environment, automated control of critical dimension (CD) within wafer has become a requirement. Current control methods to improve CD uniformity (CDU) generally rely upon the use of field by field exposure corrections via factory automation or through scanner sub-recipe. Such CDU control methods are limited to lithography step and cannot be extended to etch step. In this paper, a new method to improve CDU at post etch step by optimizing exposure at lithography step is introduced. This new solution utilizes GLOBALFOUNDRIES\u2019 factory automation system and KLA-Tencor\u2019s K-T Analyzer as the infrastructure to calculate and feed the necessary field by field level exposure corrections back to scanner, so as to achieve the optimal CDU at post etch step. CD at post lithography and post etch steps are measured by scatterometry metrology tools respectively and are used by K-T Analyzer as the input for correction calculations. This paper will explain in detail the philosophy as well as the methodology behind this novel CDU control solution. In addition, applications and use cases will be reviewed to demonstrate the capability and potential of this solution. The feasibility of adopting this solution in high-mix, high-volume manufacturing environment will be discussed as well.", "The influence of metal ions within track filter on the micro-bridge defect is investigated. We focus on the chemical reaction between immersion ArF photoresist and metal ions and then try to figure out the root cause/mechanism by systematic methods and DOE splits. Micro-bridge defect is produced by immersion ArF resist and metal ions reaction. Track filter with higher level metal extract has higher probability of creating higher micro-bridge level and hence has an impact on defect density. In the experiments, different immersion ArF resists are tested. Eventually, from the outcomes we find out the trend which can well explain the hypothesis. Following the final result, we can easily make prediction before filter inline test. Moreover, optimization of our clean track performance via proper filter selection can be achieved as well. We adopt the new methodology and conclusion at current advanced node volume production. More interestingly, in the course of investigation we find out a countermeasure which can effectively reduce filter metal extract concentration and which is applicable to next generation lithography. New filter for verification is the next stage CIP(Continue Improvement Project) and we plan to start it in the near future.", "Refractory compounds such as Trimethylsilanol (TMS) and other organic compounds such as propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) used in the photolithography area of microelectronic cleanrooms have irreversible dramatic impact on optical lenses used on photolithography tools. There is a need for real-time, continuous measurements of organic contaminants in representative cleanroom environment especially in lithography zone. Such information is essential to properly evaluate the impact of organic contamination on optical lenses. In this study, a Proton-Transfer Reaction-Time-of-Flight Mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) was applied for real-time and continuous monitoring of fugitive organic contamination induced by the fabrication process. Three types of measurements were carried out using the PTR-TOF-MS in order to detect the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) next to the tools in the photolithography area and at the upstream and downstream of chemical filters used to purge the air in the cleanroom environment. A validation and verification of the results obtained with PTR-TOF-MS was performed by comparing these results with those obtained with an off-line technique that is Automated Thermal Desorber \u2013 Gas Chromatography \u2013 Mass Spectrometry (ATD-GC-MS) used as a reference analytical method. The emerged results from the PTR-TOF-MS analysis exhibited the temporal variation of the VOCs levels in the cleanroom environment during the fabrication process. While comparing the results emerging from the two techniques, a good agreement was found between the results obtained with PTR-TOF-MS and those obtained with ATD-GC-MS for the PGMEA, toluene and xylene. Regarding TMS, a significant difference was observed ascribed to the technical performance of both instruments.", "Multi-patterning is one of the commonly used processes to shrink device node dimensions. With the miniaturization of the device node and the increasing number of coated layers and lithography processes, needs for defect reduction and control are getting stronger. Although there are needs for detecting in-film defects during the lithography process, it is difficult to verify in-film defects detected by an optical inspection tool because in-film defects usually appear as SEM Non-Visuals (SNV) during defect review using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). This makes the tuning of optical inspection tools difficult since these defects may be considered as noise. However, if these defects are \u201creal defects\u201d, they will have a negative impact to manufacturing yield. In this paper, we investigate a new methodology to detect in-film defects with high sensitivity utilizing a broadband plasma inspection tool. This methodology is expected to allow the early detection of in-film defects before the pattern formation, hence improving device manufacturing yield.", "The Double Patterning lithography (DPL) process is a well known method to overcome the k1 limit below 0.25, but the pattern final performance (OVL/CD) get more sensitive with the initial core CD uniformity, one of the main factors is across wafer CD uniformity control. Previous improvements applying scanner dose or PEB temperature multi-zone control, the others use the vacuum PEB plate design. In this study, we adopt various DPL sacrificial layers to modify wafer warpage level, it can adjust a suitable wafer warpage profile. By this method, we can achieve 30% CD uniformity improvement without the scanner dose/ PEB multi-zone heating compensation,", "Next-generation lithography technology is required to meet the needs of advanced design nodes. Directed Self Assembly (DSA) is gaining momentum as an alternative or complementary technology to EUV lithography. We investigate defectivity on a 2xnm patterning of contacts for 25nm or less contact hole assembly by grapho epitaxy DSA technology with guide patterns printed using immersion ArF negative tone development. This paper discusses the development of an analysis methodology for DSA with optical wafer inspection, based on defect source identification, sampling and filtering methods supporting process development efficiency of DSA processes and tools.", "Grapho-epitaxy based hole shrink process of Directed Self-assembly (DSA) is one of the candidates for less than 30 nm hole pattern fabrication. The guide patterns of grapho-epitaxy are made by using ArF immersion scanner under the condition of near resolution limit to the 193-nm exposure. Hence, guide patterns have measurable level of edge roughness and edge placement errors. Those errors cause serious size errors and placement errors of DSA hole patterns. RED (Robust Edge Detection) is a new measurement function of CD-SEM for qualifying guide pattern shapes and DSA pattern shapes simultaneously. We also propose GBM (Grid Based Metrology) for the measurement of DSA hole's absolute placement error. In this paper, we applied the two methods for qualifying about 20 nm-node\u2019s different polymer film thickness of DSA hole process. The DSA placement error from GBM result and relative DSA placement error obtained by RED are almost same as about 3nm (3sigma). This indicates both RED and GBM methods are correct to measure the DSA process error.", "The measurement of parts-per-trillion (ppt) level acidic and basic airborne molecular contamination (AMC) is essential for process protection and yield control in semiconductor photo-lithography and adjacent applications. Real-time monitoring solutions are highly desired, as they provide instantaneous and continuous measurement. However, even the most advanced monitors cannot achieve detection limits in the low parts-per-trillion (ppt) range and many restrictions apply for the detection of acidic AMC. High cost of ownership is another disadvantage. Discontinuous sampling with sample traps is capable of achieving ppt-level measurement, but the currently accepted methods use sample traps filled with de-ionized water (impingers) to capture soluble acidic and basic AMC. Several inherent disadvantages of these methods result in inconsistent data and increased detection limits. Some proprietary solid state solutions have been reported, but involve complex preparation, have high background signals and require 24-72 hour sample duration, or they are protected trade secrets that are not available as an industry standard. To eliminate these disadvantages, we developed a liquid-free sample trap that allows parts-per-quadrillion level (ppq) measurement of acidic and basic AMC within one work shift, typically a 4-6 hour sample period. The traps can easily be manufactured and prepared in small lab operations, are sealed and protected from the outside and operator handling in the field, have months of shelf life and show high capture efficiencies while minimizing reactions and artifacts. Capacity results for the liquid-free base trap using ammonia (NH3) as a test gas yielded more than 200 ppb-h at 100% capture efficiency without any moisture (simulating sampling of CDA or N2) and 350 ppb-h at 40% RH. The capacity results for sulfur dioxide (SO2) were highly dependent on moisture content of the sample gas and yielded 5 ppb-h at 90% capture efficiency and 0% RH, but increased exponentially to more than 1200 ppb-h at 40% RH. Performance testing indicates that the liquid-free trap provides both more precise and more accurate results for NH3, SO2 and HF in comparison to standard impinger in lab testing, with a relative standard deviation not exceeding 8% and capture efficiency greater than 95% for all three compounds. Acetic acid was the only compound that shows slightly decreased performance but still maintained a precision and accuracy comparable to the other compounds tested. In-field validation deployment to external and internal customers in parallel with standard wet impingers resulted in less than 10% difference between the traps, providing the necessary evidence that liquid-free traps are suitable for replacement of and better than wet impingers.", "Monitoring airborne molecular contamination (AMC) at the parts per trillion (ppt) level in cleanroom environments, scanner applications and compressed gas lines is essential for processes, equipment and yield-control. For the operation of EUV tools, in particular, volatile organic contamination is known to have as much impact as condensable organic compounds, which requires a suitable sampling and measurement methodology. Some of the current industry standards use sample traps comprised of porous 2,6-diphenylene-oxide polymer resin, such as Tenax\u00ae, for measuring volatile organic (<6 C-atoms, approximately IPA/acetone to toluene) and condensable organic (>6 C atoms, about toluene and higher) AMC. Inherent problems associated with these traps are a number of artifacts and chemical reactions that reduce accuracy of reported organic AMC concentrations. The break-down of the polymeric material forms false positive artifacts when used in the presence of reactive gases, such as nitrous acid and ozone, which attack and degrade the polymer to form detectable AMC. Most importantly, these traps have poor capture efficiency for volatile organic compounds (VOC). To address the disadvantages of polymer-based sample traps, we developed a method based on carbonaceous, multi-layered adsorbent traps to replace the 2,6-diphenylene-oxide polymer resin sample trap type. Along with the new trap\u2019s ability to retain volatile organics, the trap was found to provide artifact-free results. With industry trends towards detecting more contaminants while continuously reducing required reporting limits for those compounds, artifact-free and accurate detection of AMC is needed at the parts per quadrillion (ppq) level. The proposed, multi-layered trap substantially increases laboratory productivity and reduces cost by eliminating the need to analyze condensable and volatile organic compounds in two separate methods. In our studies, even some organic compounds with six C-atoms, that are part of exposure tool OEM requirements, were not effectively retained by polymeric traps, but were fully retained on the multi-layered adsorbent trap. This demonstrates that the standard trap used in the industry will result in significantly underreporting actual AMC concentrations for volatile organic compounds, including some siloxanes (TMS, HMDSO, D3). Performance of the proposed trap was excellent at both zero and 50% relative humidity, an important metric, as the trap is used for AMC detection in dry supply gases and humidified environments. Retention of all organic compounds was quantitative for more than 30 liters of air, sufficient for ppq-level detection limits. Desorption efficiency was 94% for C26 compounds. Pressure drop through the new trap was comparable to that of polymer-based traps and much lower than other, commercially available carbonaceous traps. Precision of repeated analyses was 5%, a very good result. Resolution of IPA and acetone was complete and that of a mix of halogenated refrigerants was much improved over existing methods. We propose to adopt this methodology as a new industry standard to overcome widespread inaccuracy in the reporting of volatile organic AMC and false positive condensable AMC.", "The MATRIX platform integrates new types of modules for handling and alignment capability and this represents two new and innovative aspects for multi-beam lithography. Results on performances in terms of robustness of the different modules in real manufacturing conditions, including the interface of the MATRIX platform with the SOKUDO DUO track will be reported. A new type of alignment solution was developed by MAPPER. This paper will show the first results on alignment sensor repeatability. Preliminary results on the overlay performance of the MATRIX platform will be presented and discussion will be engaged to position the MAPPER alignment concept with respect to the ITRS roadmap expectations.", "As design rule shrinks down, on-product focus control became more important since available depth of focus (DOF) is getting narrower and also required critical dimension uniformity (CDU) becomes tighter. Thus monitoring, control the scanner focus error and reducing the focus control budget of scanner are essential for the production. There are some critical layers which has so narrow DOF margin that hardly be processed on old model scanners. Our study mainly focused on the analysis of the scanner focus control budget of such layers. Among the contributors to the focus budget, inter-field focus uniformity was turned out to be the most dominant. Leveling accuracy and intra-field focus uniformity were also dominant.", "Micro/nanotechnologies evolve causing an evolution of surface characterization systems of thin films. Today, these systems are not adapted to the future needs (or current) to characterize and qualify a large effective area within industrial production. This concerns the thin film active layers or simple mask for structuring the surface. This paper proposes a quality control method for thin films of self-assembled particles and high quality. This method is founded on the intersection of several skills available in our laboratories: Industrial process of visual inspection, optical methods for quality control (large area relative to the state of the art) and advances in micro/nanotechnology (CEA/Liten).", "Photo resist micro bubble and void defect is reported as a typical and very puzzle defect type in photo lithography process, it becomes more and more significantly and severely with the IC technology drive towards 2\u00d7 node. Introduced in this paper, we have studied the mechanism of photo resist micro bubble at different in-coming wafer surface condition and tested a series of pre treatment optimization method to resolve photo resist micro bubble defect on different wafer substrate, including in the standard flat and smooth wafer surface and also in special wafer surface with high density line/space micro-structure substrate as is in logic process FinFET tri-gate structure and Nor type flash memory cell area Floating Gate/ONO/Control Gate structure. As is discovered in our paper, in general flat and smooth wafer surface, the photo resist micro bubble is formed during resist RRC coating process (resist reduction coating) and will easy lead to Si concave defect after etch; while in the high density line/space micro-structure substrate as FinFET tri-gate, the photo resist void defect is always formed after lithography pattern formation and will final cause the gate line broken after the etching process or localized over dose effect at Ion IMP layers. The 2nd type of photo resist micro bubble is much more complicated and hard to be eliminated. We try to figure out the interfacial mechanism between different type of photo resist (ArF, KrF and I-line) and pre-wet solvent by systematic methods and DOE splits. And finally, we succeeded to dig out the best solution to eliminate the micro bubble defect in different wafer surface condition and implement in the photolithography process.", "There are various data mining and analysis tools in use by high-volume semiconductor manufacturers throughout the industry that seek to provide robust monitoring and analysis capabilities for the purpose of maintaining a stable lithography process. These tools exist in both online and offline formats and draw upon data from various sources for monitoring and analysis. This paper explores several possible use cases of run-time scanner data to provide advanced overlay and imaging analysis for scanner lithography signatures. Here we demonstrate several use-cases for analyzing and stabilizing lithography processes. Applications include high order wafer alignment simulations in which an optimal alignment strategy is determined by dynamic wafer selection, reporting statistics data and analysis of the lot report and the sub-recipe as a sort of non-standard lot report, visualization of key lithography process parameters, and scanner fleet management (SFM)", "In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of scatterometry for the isolation mounts on the substrate by applying PML in RCWA. We analyze the reflectance from the silicon and resist single mount and the silicon double mounts on the silicon substrate. First, we investigate the mode convergences and the beam width dependences of reflectance. Second, we show the propagation properties of the electromagnetic fields propagating for the isolation mounts on the silicon substrate. Finally, we examine the wavelength properties of reflectance calculated by changing the beam width, the mount width and the mount height for single mount and the silicon mount positions for the double silicon mounts. Then, we understand that the scatterometry observation is possible in several decade microns beam width.", "The manufacturing of next generation semiconductor devices forces metrology tool providers for an exceptional effort in order to meet the requirements for precision, accuracy and throughput stated in the ITRS. In the past years hybrid metrology (based on data fusion theories) has been investigated as a new methodology for advanced metrology [1][2][3]. This paper provides a new point of view of data fusion for metrology through some experiments and simulations. The techniques are presented concretely in terms of equations to be solved. The first point of view is High Level Fusion which is the use of simple numbers with their associated uncertainty postprocessed by tools. In this paper, it is divided into two stages: one for calibration to reach accuracy, the second to reach precision thanks to Bayesian Fusion. From our perspective, the first stage is mandatory before applying the second stage which is commonly presented [1]. However a reference metrology system is necessary for this fusion. So, precision can be improved if and only if the tools to be fused are perfectly matched at least for some parameters. We provide a methodology similar to a multidimensional TMU able to perform this matching exercise. It is demonstrated on a 28 nm node backend lithography case. The second point of view is Deep Level Fusion which works on the contrary with raw data and their combination. In the approach presented here, the analysis of each raw data is based on a parametric model and connections between the parameters of each tool. In order to allow OCD/SEM Deep Level Fusion, a SEM Compact Model derived from [4] has been developed and compared to AFM. As far as we know, this is the first time such techniques have been coupled at Deep Level. A numerical study on the case of a simple stack for lithography is performed. We show strict equivalence of Deep Level Fusion and High Level Fusion when tools are sensitive and models are perfect. When one of the tools can be considered as a reference and the second is biased, High Level Fusion is far superior to standard Deep Level Fusion. Otherwise, only the second stage of High Level Fusion is possible (Bayesian Fusion) and do not provide substantial advantage. Finally, when OCD is equipped with methods for bias detection [5], Deep Level Fusion outclasses the two-stage High Level Fusion and will benefit to the industry for most advanced nodes production.", "Contour extraction of complicated optical proximity correction (OPC) patterns for advanced photomasks is increasingly needed in addition to the conventional mask CD measurement. The lithography simulation based on contour extraction from the SEM images on photomasks is one of the efficient methods to assure adequacy of OPC patterns. In this paper, the function of the above-mentioned contour extraction, and the performance requirements for the CD-SEM for this function using Mask CD-SEM 'Z7', the latest product of HOLON, and the scheme to correct the distortion are explained. Furthermore, the perspectives of the application of our contour extraction method are outlined.", "CD-SEM is now attracting attention as a tool that can accurately measure positional error of device patterns. However, the measurement accuracy can get worse due to pattern asymmetry as in the case of image based overlay (IBO) and diffraction based overlay (DBO). For IBO and DBO, a way of correcting the inaccuracy arising from measurement patterns was suggested. For CD-SEM, although a way of correcting CD bias was proposed, it has not been argued how to correct the inaccuracy arising from pattern asymmetry using CD-SEM. In this study we will propose how to quantify and correct the measurement inaccuracy affected by pattern asymmetry.", "The overlay performance and alignment strategy optimization for a triple patterning (LELELE) were studied based on the Monte Carlo simulation method. The simulated results show that all of the combined or worst case overlay, alignment strategy, mean target of the upper level, and mean tolerance of the lower level are dependent on the means of the lower level. A dynamic mean control method is proposed to be integrated into the APC system to improve the overlay performance.", "As the process nodes continue to shrink, overlay budgets are approaching theoretical performance of the tools. It becomes even more imperative to improve overlay performance in order to maintain the roadmap for advance integrated circuit manufacturing. One of the critical factors in 20nm manufacturing is the overlay performance between the Middle of Line (MOL) and the Poly layer. The margin between these two layers was a process limiter, it was essential that we maintain a very tight overlay control between these layers. Due to various process and metrology related effects, maintaining good overlay control became a challenge. In this paper we describe the various factors affecting overlay performance and the measures taken to mitigate or eliminate said factors to improve overlay performance.", "In advanced semiconductor N14 processes, due to the requirement of shrinking pitches for increased densities, pattern split is introduced. However, each of the two pattern split methods, SADP (Self-Aligned Double Patterning) and LELE (Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch), can incur process variations that might cause \u201cpitch walk\u201d [1, 3]. Pitch walk is a by-product of line critical dimension (CD) and spacer error (in SADP) or overlay variations (in LELE). Pitch walk not only results in different line and spaces but also affect the later steps, for example, different etched depths due to loading effects. Because of those behaviors, it is therefore a requirement to control the CD for better uniformity. This paper demonstrates how to use SCD (Scatterometry Critical Dimension) metrology tools to measure the different critical dimensions and spaces to control CD and overlay at the same process step [2]. Traditionally, wafers have to go through both a CD metrology tool and an overlay tool in order to verify CD uniformity and grid uniformity. The methodology introduced in this paper can efficiently shorten cycle time since only the CD metrology tool will be used to verify both CD and overlay. SpectraShape\u2122 is a proven optical CD platform based on spectroscopic ellipsometry and reflectometry. In optical model type metrology, pitch walk can be a challenging parameter to measure due to inherent low sensitivity. Hence this study is performed on the newest generation system, the SpectraShape\u2122 9010. A new, laser driven light source [4] on this SCD tool provides higher light intensity, producing better signal-to-noise ratios for critical device parameters. This paper explores the use of SCD to measure both resist and hard mask CD in a single step. In addition, results will be presented on using SCD to measure pitch walk, typically a low sensitivity parameter for optical CD metrology tools.", "In General, OLED, LCD, TSP Glass TFT Pattern consists of multi-layer of electrodes separated by a thin insulating film and layers are very close to each other. The inspection of electrode pattern and defect in multilayered devices by using visible light (550nm around) image is too much difficult to define its critical shape among layers, because of deep depth range in conventional optics of moderate numerical aperture (NA). To increase image contrast between materials and layers, this study uses UV wavelength that has larger selective differences of reflectance than visible light. Newly developed optical system and image analysis units are focused to the proper inspection wavelength at the specific UV range to clearly define a top electrode layer and reduce image processing time. To detect defects on the electrode, the resolution of the optical system should be much higher than the spatial frequency of the electrode size. After considering system requirements, two types of different magnification systems (1.2X and 3X) are developed. Direct side illumination is available in 1.2X system which has large back focal length, however, 3X system needs on axis illumination. Line beam illumination from the multi-point LED source (custom made) is used to increase the light efficiency and decrease noise(4). Illumination beam passing through the common objective lens (in front of imaging optics) and illumination optics (including cylinder lens) can realized uniform intensity of one dimensional Fourier plane on the surface of target electrode. Electric units for high speed data processing and transfer and image processing algorithm are also developed. For processing large capacity image data (8 GB) synchronized with moving sensors in real time, embedded system with hardware optimizing design and FPGA module camera are adopted. Final image shows good selective contrast and resolution between layers even in the high depth condition followed by required NA for the target resolution. This inspection system can be used in inspection of PCB Pattern, LCD, OLED and Mobile Glass including many other film and glass.", "Optical critical dimension (OCD) metrology using scatterometry has been widely adopted for fast and non-destructive in-line process control and yield improvement. Recently there has been increased interest in metrology performance enhancement through a holistic approach. We investigate the benefits of feed-forward of metrology information from prior process steps using samples from magnetic hard disk drive manufacturing. The scatterometry targets are composed of rather isolated gratings that are designed to have better correlation with device features. Two gratings, one with pitch \u2248 10CD, and the other with pitch \u2248 15CD, are measured at post develop and post reactive ion etch (RIE) steps. Two methods: parameter feed-forward (PFF) and spectrum feedforward (SFF) are studied in which the measurement results or spectrum collected on the blanket target at photo step are fed forward to the measurements on the grating structures at post develop or post RIE step. Compared with standard measurement without FF, for the more isolated grating at photo step, both PFF and SFF improve CD correlation from R2=0.96 to R2=0.975 using CD-SEM results measured on device as the reference. Dynamic precision and fleet measurement precision are improved by 20-60%. For post RIE step, PFF and SFF significantly improve CD correlation from R2=0.95, slope=1.09 to R2=0.975, slope=1.03 for the denser grating, and from R2=0.90, slope=0.79 to R2=0.96, slope=0.96 for the more isolated grating. Dynamic precision is generally improved by 20-40%. It is observed that both PFF and SFF are equally efficient in reducing parameter correlation for the application studied here.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) is being actively investigated as a potential patterning solution for future generation devices. While SEM based CD measurement is currently used in research and development, scatterometry-based techniques like spectroscopic CD (SCD) are preferred for high volume manufacturing. SCD can offer information about sub-surface features that are not available from CD-SEM measurement. Besides, SCD is a non-destructive, high throughput technique already adopted in HVM in several advanced nodes. The directed self assembly CD measurement can be challenging because of small dimensions and extremely thin layers in the DSA stack. In this study, the SCD technology was investigated for a 14 nm resolution PS-b-PMMA chemical epitaxy UW process optimized by imec. The DSA stack involves new materials such as cross-linkable polysterene (XPS) of thickness approximately 5 nm, ArF immersion resist (subsequently removed), -OH terminated neutral brush layer, and BCP material (Polystyrene-blockmethyl methacrylate of thickness roughly 20 to 30 nm). The mask contains a large CD and pitch matrix, for studying the quality of self-assembly as a function of the guide pattern dimensions. We report on the ability of SCD to characterize the dimensional variation in these targets and hence provide a viable process control solution.", "We have developed a practicable measurement technique that can help to achieve reliable inspections for systematic defects in advanced semiconductor devices. Systematic defects occurring in the design and mask processes are a dominant component of integrated circuit yield loss in nano-scaled technologies. Therefore, it is essential to ensure systematic defects are detected at an early stage of wafer fabrication. In the past, printed pattern shapes have been evaluated by human eyes or by taking manual critical dimension (CD) measurements. However, these operations are sometimes unstable and inaccurate. Last year, we proposed a new technique for taking measurements by using a SEM contour [1]. This technique enables a highly precise quantification of various complex 2D shaped patterns by comparing a contour extracted from a SEM image using a CD measurement algorithm and an ideal pattern. We improved this technique to enable the carrying out of inspections suitable for every pattern structure required for minimizing the process margin. This technique quantifies a pattern shape of a target-layer pattern using information on a multi-layered circuit structure. This enabled it to confirm the existence of a critical defect in a circuit connecting upper/lower-layers. This paper describes the improved technique and the evaluation results obtained in evaluating it in detail.", "In lithography, overlay control is getting increasingly complex. Advanced Process Control (APC) is introduced to minimize excursions from the process window for the present exposure. APC uses metrology data of previously exposed wafers, hence, there is always a delay of tens of minutes before the required information is available. This paper proposes the combination of a patterned expose beam and a patterned fluorescent marker on a wafer to generate a fluorescent signal that carries real-time information of the focus and/or position error of the expose pattern with the pattern on the wafer. A practical realization requires some changes to the exposure process, stepper design and reticle lay-out. Firstly, a matched pair of markers on the wafer and reticle is required. Secondly, the generated fluorescent signal must be measured, for example with a (spectrally filtered) photon counter close to the expose area of the wafer. At last, the markers from the previous lithography step shall, after development, be filled with fluorescent material. This deposition requires an additional process step. Photon budget calculations suggest an overlay measurement accuracy of less than a tenth of a nm (real-time).", "As design rules of advance devices shrink down, not only process-window budget of lithography process is getting tighter, but also CD control to target is more important especially for multiple tool process environment in HVM (High Volume Manufacturing). The tool induced CD bias or CD difference between tools are derived by minute amount of residual imaging parameters even though with strict control in system. The tool to tool CD mismatch is able to be reduced to nanometer or sub-nanometer scale for critical features of concern by using released tools such as LithoTuner PMFCTM (Pattern Matcher Full Chip). During the matching process, tunable imaging parameters such as pupil shape and stage tilt can be used as matching knobs. In this paper, CD mismatch due to film stack change on same exposure tool was studied to check feasibility of PMFC application. Also, CD variation and its impact on CD mismatch by focus error as amount of intrinsic system was investigated as well. By considering the focus impact on CD proximity bias via simple mathematical ways, the CD matching process could be more accurately performed and verified.", "Persistently shrinking design rules and increasing process complexity require tight control and monitoring of the exposure tool parameters [1, 2]. While control of exposure dose by means of resist single metric measurements is common and widely adopted. Focus assessment and monitoring are usually more difficult to achieve. A diffused method to determine process specific dose and focus conditions is based on plotting Bossung curves from single CD-SEM measurements and choosing the best focus setting to obtain the desired target CD with the widest useful window. With this approach there is no opportunity to build a data flow architecture that can enable continuous focus monitoring on nominal production wafers [3-5]. KLA-Tencor has developed a method to enable in-line monitoring of scanner focus on production wafers by measuring resist profile shapes on grating targets using scatterometry, and analyzing the information using AcuShapeTM and K-T AnalyzerTM software. This methodology is based on a fast and robust determination of best scanner focus by analyzing focus-exposure matrices (FEMs). This paper will demonstrate the KT CDFE and FEM Analysis methods and their application in production environment.", "Defect classification and characterization on mask substrates and blanks can be used to the identify defect sources within the tool and process. Defect reduction has been achieved in SEMATECH\u2019s EUV Mask Blank Development Center (MBDC), aided by successful classifications of defect populations. Failure analysis of EUV substrate and blank defects in the MBDC begins with automatic classification of defects detected by M1350 and M7360 Lasertec inspection tools. Two sets of defect images and classification emerge from the two detection tools. The M1350 provides a more variegated set of 13 defect class types, while the M7360 provides eight. During manual review of the classifications, the defect class sets for both tools are often collapsed to only two major classes of interests with respect to production and failure analysis: particles and pits. This leaves various other classes ignored before subsequent characterization steps like SEM classification and composition analysis. The usefulness of tracking and verifying more detailed classes of defect needs to be explored. SEM analysis can be used to validate the relative size comparison yielded from inspection data alone, beyond the calibrated comparison of inspection signals from well-understood polystyrene latex spheres. The accuracy of rule-based defect classification of inspection tool data must be quantified by statistical tracking and validation SEM analysis. Classification of false counts increases as sensitivity of detection tools are increased to ensure the capture of smallest defects. The validity of calling a defect \u201cfalse\u201d is usually a manual review of pixel images created on the detection tool.", "The purpose of this study is to understand EUV+SADP defectivity in 15nm line and space (L&S) pattern, and to examine bright-field inspection capabilities at the 1Xnm node. Programmed defects of known size, shape, and location were printed in dense patterned areas using EUV lithography at IMEC. To track these defects throughout development, a defectivity study was conducted using bright-field inspection after four SADP processing steps. The smallest defect routinely detected had a programmed size of 14nm, and the defect signal was enhanced using polarized light. By comparing defect locations at the beginning and end stages of development, it was found that 95% of defects remained the same. This illustrates the importance of post-lithography wafer inspection. This research shows how defect characteristics on the EUV mask affect the final pattern and demonstrate the sensitivity of bright-field inspection at the 1Xnm node.", "Advanced IC fabs must inspect critical reticles on a frequent basis to ensure high wafer yields. These necessary requalification inspections have traditionally carried high risk and expense. Manually reviewing sometimes hundreds of potentially yield-limiting detections is a very high-risk activity due to the likelihood of human error; the worst of which is the accidental passing of a real, yield-limiting defect. Painfully high cost is incurred as a result, but high cost is also realized on a daily basis while reticles are being manually classified on inspection tools since these tools often remain in a non-productive state during classification. An automatic defect analysis system (ADAS) has been implemented at a 20nm node wafer fab to automate reticle defect classification by simulating each defect\u2019s printability under the intended illumination conditions. In this paper, we have studied and present results showing the positive impact that an automated reticle defect classification system has on the reticle requalification process; specifically to defect classification speed and accuracy. To verify accuracy, detected defects of interest were analyzed with lithographic simulation software and compared to the results of both AIMS\u2122 optical simulation and to actual wafer prints.", "Accurate and fast kernel-based proximity effect correction (PEC) models are indispensable to full-chip proximity effect simulation and correction. The attempt to utilize optical scatterometers for PEC model calibration instead of scanning electron microscopes is primarily motivated by the fact that scatterometry can be faster, more stable, and more informative if carefully implemented. Conventional scatterometry measures periodic patterns and retrieves their dimensional parameters by solving inverse problems of optical scattering with predefined libraries of the periodic patterns. PEC model parameters can be subsequently calibrated with the retrieved dimensional parameters. However, measuring only periodic patterns limits the usage of scatterometry, and the dimensional reconstruction is prone to generate estimation errors for patterns with complex three-dimensional geometry. Previously, we have proposed directly utilizing scattering light for PEC model calibration without the need for the intermediate step of retrieving the dimensional parameters. By iteratively comparing scattered light from predefined calibration patterns measured by a scatterometer to that predicted by the corresponding scattering and lithography models, PEC model parameters can be effectively calibrated with standard numerical optimization algorithms and one-dimensional periodic patterns. In this work, two-dimensional periodic circuit layouts are designed and utilized to study the applicability and potential limitations of the proposed method on the lithography of practical circuit designs.", "The background in simple dark field particle inspection shows a high scatter variance which cannot be distinguished from signals by small particles. According to our models, illumination from different azimuths can reduce the background variance. A multi-azimuth illumination has been successfully integrated on the Rapid Nano particle scanner. This illumination method reduces the variance of the background scattering on substrate roughness. It allows for a lower setting of the detection threshold, resulting in a more sensitive inspection system. By implementing this system the lower detection limit of the scanner was reduced from 59 nm to 42 nm LSE. A next improvement, a change of the inspection wavelength to 193 nm will bring the detection limit to sub 20 nm.", "Optical metrology system is used as high sampling CD measurement. The optical measurement technology using Fourier image can obtain much information with various optical conditions. We evaluated Fourier image method for CD metrology. Various issues of the optical measurement technology were found for CD measurement uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty depends on the number of position on Fourier image, and measurement uncertainty is improved by using multiple positions data. Top CD value is influenced by under layer pattern CD variance and under layer thickness variance. Optical CD measurement technology is influenced by various process variation like under-layer structure, stacked film thickness, material changes and so on. If optical measurement system applies to CD metrology, Fourier image method should be used in development phase for unfixed process because high number of data and speedy process feedback in no under layer situation is needed.", "A virtual multiple-input multiple-output (VMIMO) architecture is proposed recently, which allows cooperatively data exchange among each node in a sensor network. We consider to apply the adaptive filter to design a VMIMO receiver. In order to improve the convergence problem and reduce the complexity of the scalar-form Affine Projection (AP), the method of set-membership filtering (SMF) is applied to the Affine Projection adaptive algorithms. Simulation results show that the SMF is able to reduce the computational complexity effectively and achieves a better performance.", "Phase Shift Focus Monitor (PSFM) has been successfully utilized as a focus monitoring tool for scanners and steppers from the g-line era to the most advanced immersion technology nodes. PSFM exhibits high sensitivity, linearity and repeatability for immersion scanners with the illumination conditions of conventional mode and NA0.93. A microlithography model was created using Hyperlith to study the PSFM sensitivity and linearity under the conditions of OAI (off-axis illumination) and high NA (0.95~1.35). The model predicts that a PSFM sensitivity of 700 ~ 1000 nm/um can be achieved when an OAI, 40 nm PSFM target and NA 1.35 are used. The model also studied the influence of various parameters on PSFM sensitivity and linearity. Wafer data verified the simulation results. PSFM linear focus range with the NA1.35 condition is shorter than that of NA0.93. The influence of illumination conditions on PSFM, such as OAI modes (annular, Quadra), NA / Sigma values and PSFM target sizes, has also been investigated by the microlithography model.", "In this paper we describe the joint development and optimization of the critical dimension uniformity (CDU) at an advanced 300 mm ArFi semiconductor facility of SK Hynix in the high volume device. As the ITRS CDU specification shrinks, semiconductor companies still need to maintain high wafer yield and high performance (hence market value) even during the introduction phase of a new product. This cannot be achieved without continuous improvement of the on-product CDU as one of the main drivers for yield improvement. ASML Imaging Optimizer is one of the most efficient tools to reach this goal. This paper presents experimental results of post-etch CDU improvement by ASML imaging optimizer for immature photolithography and etch processes on critical features of 20nm node. We will show that CDU improvement potential and measured CDU strongly depend on CD fingerprint stability through wafers, lots and time. However, significant CDU optimization can still be achieved, even for variable CD fingerprints. In this paper we will review point-to-point correlation of CD fingerprints as one of the main indicators for CDU improvement potential. We will demonstrate the value of this indicator by comparing CD correlation between wafers used for Imaging Optimizer dose recipe development, predicted and measured CDU for wafers and lots exposed with various delays ranging from a few days to a month. This approach to CDU optimization helps to achieve higher yield earlier in the new product introduction cycle, enables faster technology ramps and thereby improves product time to market.", "The continual increasing demands upon Plasma Etching systems to self-clean and continue Plasma Etching with minimal downtime allows for the examination of SiCN, SiO2 and SiN defectivity based upon Surface Scanning Inspection Systems (SSIS) wafer scan results. Historically all Surface Scanning Inspection System wafer scanning recipes have been based upon Polystyrene Spheres wafer deposition for each film stack and the subsequent creation of light scattering sizing response curves. This paper explores the feasibility of the elimination of Polystyrene Latex Sphere (PSL) and/or process particle deposition on both filmed and bare Silicon wafers prior to Surface Scanning Inspection System recipe creation. The study will explore the theoretical maximal Surface Scanning Inspection System sensitivity based on PSL recipe creation in conjunction with the maximal sensitivity derived from Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) maximal sensitivity modeling recipe creation. The surface roughness (Root Mean Square) of plasma etched wafers varies dependent upon the process film stack. Decrease of the root mean square value of the wafer sample surface equates to higher surface scanning inspection system sensitivity. Maximal sensitivity SSIS scan results from bare and filmed wafers inspected with recipes created based upon Polystyrene/Particle Deposition and recipes created based upon BRDF modeling will be overlaid against each other to determine maximal sensitivity and capture rate for each type of recipe that was created with differing recipe creation modes. A statistically valid sample of defects from each Surface Scanning Inspection system recipe creation mode and each bare wafer/filmed substrate will be reviewed post SSIS System processing on a Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscope (DRSEM). Native defects, Polystyrene Latex Spheres will be collected from each statistically valid defect bin category/size. The data collected from the DRSEM will be utilized to determine the maximum sensitivity capture rate for each recipe creation mode. Emphasis will be placed upon the sizing accuracy of PSL versus BRDF modeling results based upon automated DRSEM defect sizing. An examination the scattering response for both Mie and Rayleigh will be explored in relationship to the reported sizing variance of the SSIS to make a determination of the absolute sizing accuracy of the recipes there were generated based upon BRDF modeling. This paper explores both the commercial and technical considerations of the elimination of PSL deposition as a precursor to SSIS recipe creation. Successful integration of BRDF modeling into the technical aspect of SSIS recipe creation process has the potential to dramatically reduce the recipe creation timeline and vetting period. Integration of BRDF modeling has the potential to greatly reduce the overhead operation costs for High Volume Manufacturing sites by eliminating the associated costs of third party PSL deposition.", "In this paper, set of wafers with separated processes was prepared and overlay measurement result was compared in two methods; IBO and DBO. Based on the experimental result, theoretical approach of relationship between overlay mark deformation and overlay variation is presented. Moreover, overlay reading simulation was used in verification and prediction of overlay variation due to deformation of overlay mark caused by induced processes. Through this study, understanding of individual process effects on overlay measurement error is given. Additionally, guideline of selecting proper overlay measurement scheme for specific layer is presented.", "As the design rule of semiconductor process gets finer, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology is aggressively studied as a process for 22nm half pitch and beyond. At present, the studies for EUV focus on manufacturability. It requires fine resolution, uniform, smooth patterns and low defectivity, not only after lithography but also after the etch process. In the first half of 2013, a CLEAN TRACKTM LITHIUS ProTMZ-EUV was installed at imec for POR development in preparation of the ASML NXE:3300. This next generation coating/developing system is equipped with state of the art defect reduction technology. This tool with advanced functions can achieve low defect levels. This paper reports on the progress towards manufacturing defectivity levels and latest optimizations towards the NXE:3300 POR for both lines/spaces and contact holes at imec.", "The predictive power of computational lithography is often demonstrated by showing predicted 2D pattern shapes compared with top-down SEM images. However, image formation in a SEM is a complex process [1,2,3], and for most 3D lithography and OPC simulators, line width measurements and 2D pattern shapes are based on extracted resist polygons at a fixed height above the substrate. Generating resist polygon shapes with this method is driven by computationally efficiency instead of an attempt to describe the image formation process in an actual SEM. We present PROLITH photolithography simulations combined with simulation of the CD SEM to investigate the interactions between lithography and metrology. Our CD SEM simulator is a simplification of the complicated image formation process [4], but it captures many effects seen experimentally. For example, narrow trenches and contact holes are dark at the bottom in our simulated SEM images, while for isolated lines, the sidewall of the photoresist can clearly be observed all the way to the resist foot at the substrate. This simple result has important implications when evaluating lithographic phenomena such as LWR: for polygon-based metrology, simulated LWR is approximately constant with resist thickness; by contrast, the LWR increases with decreasing thickness when the same simulated 3D resist profiles are evaluated with the CD SEM simulator.", "OPC model of high quality relies on the accumulation of thousands of CD-SEM measurements with the drawback of long cycle time for data collection. Moreover regular CD measurements are not robust when dealing with critical bi-dimensional structures. In this paper, we propose to use SEM image contours for OPC model calibration and demonstrate the advantage in term of metrology work load. Two set of contours based on resist top and resist bottom measurements are extracted after lithography to generate simultaneously two OPC models. The performances of both models are evaluated with respect to rigorous S-Litho simulations. The model based on the resist bottom is very well matched with the rigorous simulation whereas the model based on resist top is not always following the rigorous simulation. It appears that resist thickness variations on specific hotspots is not compatible with the assumption of a simulated contour located in a single plane in resist.", "Advanced SEM simulation has become a key element in the ability of SEM inspection, metrology and defect review to meet the challenges of advanced technologies. It grants additional capabilities to the end user, such as 3D height measurements, accurate virtual metrology, and supports Design Based Metrology to bridge the gap between design layout and SEM image. In this paper we present SEM simulations capabilities, which take into consideration all parts of the SEM physical and electronic path, interaction between Electron beam and material, multi perspective SEM imaging and shadowing derived from proximity effects caused by the interaction of the Secondary Electrons signal with neighboring pattern edges. Optimizing trade-off between simulation accuracy, calibration procedures and computational complexity, the simulation is running in real-time with minimum impact on throughput. Experiment results demonstrate Height measurement capacities, and CAD based simulated pattern is compared with SEM image to evaluate simulated pattern fidelity.", "We present an approach named on-edge lithography, where chiral shaped pattern are yield through the combination of electron beam lithography in variable shape or cell projection mode and shadow evaporation. On one hand, we describe the process and reveal advantages when opposed to other common nano fabrication techniques. On the other hand, we also figure out challenges for successful technological application. Finally we demonstrate the useability of the process by revealing SEM pictures of a couple of realized chiral nanostructures. In order to evaluate the process we further present optical measurements. We find peak values of circular dichroism of 44% at 420 THz (715 nm). The process is applicable on large scale and to the fullest compatible with other nano-lithographic tools e.g. nanoimprint replication techniques, thus pushing chiral nanomaterial fabrication towards highest efficiency.", "A resist imaging design that utilizes photoacid inhibition of cationic polymerization and cross-linking during a postexposure bake step has been studied. The key to the design approach is the use of two different polymerization catalysts/initiators: (1) a photoacid produced from a photoacid generator (PAG) upon exposure of the resist that can result in polymerization and cross-linking of the resist matrix and (2) a thermal cross-linking catalyst (TCC) designed to thermally catalyze epoxide-phenol cross-linking. The TCC can be chosen from a variety of compounds such as triphenylphosphine (TPP) or imidazole. When only one of these catalysts (e.g TPP or photoacid) is present in an epoxide and phenol containing resist matrix, it will individually catalyze cross-linking. When they are present together, they effectively quench one another and little to no cross-linking occurs. This approach can be used to switch the tone of a resist from negative (photoacid catalyzed) to positive (TCC catalyzed and photoacid inhibited). The effect of the ratio of TCC:PAG was examined and the optimal ratio for positive tone behavior was determined. Resist contrast can be modified by optimization of epoxide:phenol ratio in the formulation. Dual tone behavior with positive tone at low dose and negative tone at higher doses can be observed in certain formulation conditions. Initial EUV patterning shows poor results, but the source of the poor imaging is not yet understood.", "Star block copolymer synthesis was performed in a controlled fashion by an in-situ core first ATRP route. The obtained resist materials on the basis of industrial used monomers with tailored star block copolymer architecture were systematically characterized and patterned. In dissolution investigations an excellent dissolution contrast between exposed and unexposed state was identified for this new resist material type. Additionally, the materials show an excellent sensitivity, which surpass the reference linear copolymer by a factor of eight. By a combinatorial resist optimization realized high resolution features are presented. Finally, preliminary results utilizing a further improved resist material design are shown.", "Sub-millisecond laser post-exposure bake (PEB) is an alternative technology to address the excessive acid diffusion for chemically amplified photoresist systems. By rationally designing the resist, laser post-exposure bake is able to improve the resolution and reduce the line width roughness (LWR) compared to patterns exposed under the same conditions but using conventional hotplate PEB. It was found that only the resist with high deprotection activation energy and low diffusion activation energy showed improved performance using laser PEB. Accordingly, a PAG was designed to have low acid diffusivity by binding the counter ions to a molecular glass core while keeping photophysical properties and processing conditions similar to a conventional PAG. By reducing the diffusivity of the counter ions, the PAG was able to further reduce LWR by 60% using laser PEB.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) of Block Co-Polymers (BCP) has become an intense field of study as a potential patterning solution for future generation devices. The most critical challenges that need to be understood and controlled include pattern placement accuracy, achieving low defectivity in DSA patterns and how to make chip designs DSA-friendly. The DSA program at imec includes efforts on these three major topics. Specifically, in this paper the progress in setting up flows for templated DSA within the imec program will be discussed. A process has been implemented based on a hard mask as the template layer. In this paper primarily the impact of local pattern density and BCP film thickness on the templated DSA process are discussed. The open hole rate and the placement accuracy of BCP patterns within the template are the primary figures of merit.", "We report a simple technique to fabricate horizontal, uniform Si nanowire arrays with controlled orientation and density at spatially well defined locations on substrate based on insitu hard mask pattern formation approach by microphase separated polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) block copolymer (BCP) thin films. The methodology may be applicable to large scale production. Ordered microphase separated patterns of the BCP were defined by solvent annealing and the orientation was controlled by film thickness and annealing time. Films of PEO cylinders with parallel orientation (to the surface plane) were applied to create \u2018frames\u2019 for the generation of inorganic oxide nanowire arrays. These PEO cylinders were subject to selective metal ion inclusion and subsequent processing was used to create iron oxide nanowire arrays. The oxide nanowires were isolated, of uniform diameter and their structure a mimic of the original BCP nanopatterns. The phase purity, crystallinity and thermal stability of the nanowires coupled to the ease of large scale production may make them useful in technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that the oxide nanowire arrays could be used as a resist mask to fabricate densely packed, identical ordered, good fidelity silicon nanowire arrays on the substrate. The techniques may have significant application in the manufacture of transistor circuitry.", "Directed self-assembly (DDSA) of block copolymers ((BCP) is attracting a growing amount of interest as a techhnique to expand traditional lithography beyond its current limits. It has reecently been demonstrated that chemoepitaxy can be used to successfully ddirect BCP assembly to form large arrays off high-density features. The imec DSA LiNe flow uses lithography and trim-etch to produce a \u201cprepattern\u201d of cross-linked polystyrene (PS) stripes, which in turn guide the formation of assembled BCPP structures. Thhe entire process is predicated on the preferential interaction of the respective BCP domains with particular regionss of the underlying prepattern. The use of polystyrene as the guiding material is not uniquely required, however, and in fact may not even be preferable. This study investigates an alternate chemistry \u2013\u2013 crosslinked poly(methyl methacrylate), X-PMMA, \u2013\u2013 as the underlying polymer mat, providing a route to higher auto-affinity and therefore a stronger guiding ability. In addition to tthe advantages of the chemistry under investigation, this study explores the broader theme of extending BCP DSA to other materials.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) process is one of the attractive processes for creating the very fine pitch pattern. Especially, the contact hole shrink processes with block-co-polymer (BCP) or polymer blend materials were attractive processes for creating very small size hole patterns with better CD uniformity compare to general photo-lithography patterning. In general contact hole shrink process, the pattern of Spin-on Carbon Hardmask (SOC) or the photo Resist pattern created by Negative-Tone Development (NTD) process were selected for guide patterns. Since the alignment property of BCP was affected by the surface of these guide materials, it is important to control the surface condition of guide in order to obtain good shrunk contact hole patterns. In this study, we will report the surface treatment materials to control the surface condition of guide patterns such as SOC or NTD resist to achieve the better contact hole shrink performance. These materials were attached to guide pattern surface and controlled the surface energy.", "Resolution requirements for photolithography have reached beyond the wavelength of light. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly complicated and expensive to further minimize feature dimensions as required to push the limits of Moore\u2019s law. EUV lithography has been the much anticipated solution; however, its insertion timing for High Volume Manufacturing is still an uncertainty due to source power and EUV mask infrastructure limitations. Extending the limits of 193nm immersion lithography requires pitch division using either Double Patterning Pitch Division (DPPD), and/or Spacer Based Pitch Division (SBPD) schemes (e.g. Hard mask image transfer methods (Double, Triple, Quadruple)). While these approaches reduce pitch, there is an associated risk/compromise of process complexity, and overlay accuracy budget issues. Directed Self Assembly (DSA) processes offer the promise of providing alternative ways to extend optical lithography cost-effectively for sub-10nm nodes and present itself as an alternative pitch division approach. As a result, DSA has gained increased momentum in recent years, as a means for extending optical lithography past its current limits. The availability of a DSA processing line can enable to further push the limits of 193nm immersion lithography and overcome some of the critical concerns for EUV lithography. Robust etch transfer of DSA patterns into commonly used device integration materials such as silicon, silicon nitride, and silicon dioxide had been previously demonstrated [1,2]. However DSA integration to CMOS process flows, including cut/keep structures to form fin arrays, is yet to be demonstrated on relevant film stacks (front-end-of-line device integration such as hard mask stacks, and STI stacks). Such a demonstration will confirm and reinforce its viability as a candidate for sub-10nm technology nodes.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) is one of the most promising technologies for scaling feature sizes to 16 nm and below. Both line/space and hole patterns can be created with various block copolymer morphologies, and these materials allow for molecular-level control of the feature shapes\u2014exactly the characteristics that are required for creating high fidelity lithographic patterns. Over the past five years, the industry has been addressing the technical challenges of maturing this technology by addressing concerns such as pattern defectivity, materials specifications, design layout, and tool requirements. Though the learning curve has been steep, DSA has made significant progress toward implementation in high-volume manufacturing. Tokyo Electron has been focused on the best methods of achieving high-fidelity patterns using DSA processing. Unlike other technologies where optics and photons drive the formation of patterns, DSA relies on surface interactions and polymer thermodynamics to determine the final pattern shapes. These phenomena, in turn, are controlled by the processing that occurs on clean-tracks, etchers, and cleaning systems, and so a host of new technology has been developed to facilitate DSA. In this paper we will discuss the processes and hardware that are emerging as critical enablers for DSA implementation, and we will also demonstrate the kinds of high fidelity patterns typical of mainstream DSA integrations.", "This work discusses about the in situ characterization of pattern formation during resist dissolution using a high-speed atomic force microscope. The focus of which is the analysis of the dissolution characteristics of a polyhydroxystryrene (PHS)-methacrylate hybrid resist material during negative-tone development (NTD) with an organic solvent developer in comparison to positive-tone development (PTD) with aqueous alkali-based developers. To further understand how pattern formation occurs for this type of resist in such developers, two versions of the same resist were prepared with low and high polymer resin molecular weights (MW). Lithographic exposure evaluations of these resists showed that the lower MW resist (\u00d70.4 MW compared to the high MW resist) resulted in improved resolution and smoother patterns after development (for both PTD and NTD). During development, HS-AFM in situ analysis results show that a lower MW induces smoother patterns and smaller dissolution units. This was especially distinct during development in NTD. Such results suggest the effect of material MW and its dissolution characteristics on the quality of pattern formed.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) is one of the most promising technologies for scaling feature sizes to 16 nm and below.

During substrate rotation,, a high-speed video camera is used to observe characteristic phenomena which lead to the generation of these rather typical defects. Post coating non-uniformity defects were linked to bubble formation, and post develop defects were associated with thee wafer drying conditions. By correlating high-speed camera images and defect inspection results from several different resists we can disclose the defect generation mechanism of multiple typical phenomena.", "Negative tone resists based on cross-linking via epoxide/cationic polymerization have a variety of potential advantages over more traditional positive tone resists based on photoacid catalyzed deprotection including low outgassing, intrinsic diffusion control, and improved pattern collapse performance through the higher modulus provided by a cross-linked network. Based on the promising baseline performance achieved previously in simple negative tone systems composed only of an epoxide functionalized molecular glass and a photoacid generator, a series of different methods and additives that can be used to control the extent and rate of cross-linking in such systems have been developed and are reported here which allow for even further improvement in resist performance. Simple addition of base quencher, as is used in conventional chemically amplified resists, is ineffective in these systems because the patterning reaction mechanism is different. Any control method must work by modifying the extent and rate of cationic polymerization of epoxides. By adding molecules containing phenolic OH groups to such an epoxide resist, one can slow the extent of cross-linking due to introduction of an additional reaction pathway and often a concomitant increase in the resist resin glass transition temperature. Generalized additives similar to base quencher were also developed based on the addition of strong nucleophiles such as triphenylphosphine which act essentially as chain termination agents. This approach allows for improved resolution and LER in negative tone epoxide resist systems. A more superior additive was developed that can be described as a photodecomposable nucleophile (PDN). The unexposed PDN acts similarly to the strong nucleophile additives in that it terminates chain propagation. Upon exposure, the PDN can act like a chain transfer agent or an additional initiator, but no longer has the effect of completely terminating chain propagation. This approach allows for high levels of control in the nominally unexposed regions of the resist, but maintains high efficiency of cross-linking in the most highly exposed regions. One particular implementation of a PDN used in this study is the blending of a PAG (i.e. triphenylsulfonium triflate, TPS-Tf) with a more nucleophilic anion that plays the role of a PDN, with the common and highly effective, non-nucleophilic PAG that is conventionally used in epoxide photopolymerizations (i.e. triphenylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate, TPS-SbF6). Addition of only a few percent of TPS-Tf to a baseline epoxide resist formulation shows a 5-10 nm improvement in ultimate resolution and a reduction in LER to around 65% as compared to the baseline resist without the PDN additive while only incurring a moderate increase in imaging dose. By modulating the amount of the different polymerization control additives, the performance of a particular epoxide resist was improved from a resolution of greater than 30 nm half pitch and an LER of around 9 nm to a resolution of ~20 nm half pitch, with an LER of around 4 nm, and a sensitivity of 18 mJ/cm2. By increasing the additive loading even further, the resolution was improved to ~18 nm half pitch, although with an increase in imaging dose to 39 mJ/cm2.", "Understanding fundamental properties of photoresists and how interactions between photoresist components affect performance targets are crucial to the continued success of photoresists. More specifically, polymer solubility is critical to the overall performance capability of the photoresist formulation. While several theories describe polymer solvent solubility, the most common industrially applied method is Hansen\u2019s solubility parameters. Hansen\u2019s method, based on regular solution theory, describes a solute\u2019s ability to dissolve in a solvent or solvent blend using four physical properties determined experimentally through regression of solubility data in many known solvents. The four physical parameters are dispersion, polarity, hydrogen bonding, and radius of interaction. Using these parameters a relative cohesive energy difference (RED), which describes a polymer\u2019s likelihood to dissolve in a given solvent blend, may be calculated. Leveraging a high throughput workflow to prepare and analyze the thousands of samples necessary to calculate the Hansen\u2019s solubility parameters from many different methacrylate-based polymers, we compare the physical descriptors to reveal a large range of polarities and hydrogen bonding. Further, we find that Hansen\u2019s model correctly predicts the soluble/insoluble state of 3-component solvent blends where the dispersion, polar, hydrogen-bonding, and radius of interaction values were determined through regression of experimental values. These modeling capabilities have allowed for optimization of the photoresist solubility from initial blending through application providing valuable insights into the nature of photoresist.", "The use of organic solvents in the development of chemically amplified (CA) resists has been known since the introduction of DUV lithography into manufacturing over twenty years ago [1,2]. In this approach a negative tone image is produced using an aqueous base developable positive tone resist developed in an organic solvent. Recently there has been an increased interest in negative tone imaging due to superior performance for specific masking levels such as narrow trenches and contact holes [3]. Negative tone imaging of this type is based on differences in the polarity between the exposed and unexposed regions of the resist film. The dissolution contrast can be optimized by selecting a solvent with the proper match of solubility parameters (polarity, hydrogen bonding and dispersion) to attain good solubility of the relatively nonpolar unexposed resist and poor solubility of the deprotected acidic exposed film. Another approach is to tune the properties of the resist polymer for a given solvent, creating a new optimized resist. We have explored a third methodology to achieve a high contrast solvent developable system without a need to modify resist or solvent. In this report we describe a process that exploits the differences in solubility between ionic and organic materials. In this method an ionic species is introduced into the resist film following post-exposure bake to alter the polarity in such way that the resist contrast can be improved in organic solvent development. We describe processes using pre-rinses and developers containing salts. Lithographic response, characterized using contrast curves and imaging, is presented for a variety of resist platforms. We show evidence for ionic incorporation into the resist film using SIMS, XPS, QCM and FTIR characterization. We demonstrate the practical applicability of this method to 248nm, 193nm, e-beam and EUV exposures.", "The usage of phasefluid based stripping agents to remove photoresists from silicon substrates was studied. Due to their highly dynamic inner structure phasefluids offer a new working principle, they are penetrating layers through smallest openings and lift off the material from the surface. These non-aggressive stripping fluids were investigated regarding their cleaning efficiency as well as contamination behavior to enable usage in semiconductor and MEMS manufacturing. A general proof of concept for the usage of phasefluids in resist stripping processes is shown on silicon coupons and BKM\u2019s are given for different resist types. In addition a baseline process on 12inch wafers has been developed and characterized in terms of metallic and ionic impurities and defect level.", "To make photomasks with high overlay accuracy, \u201cCharge Dissipation Layer (CDL)\u201d materials have been developed. Commercialized CDL materials can reduce electro-static charging on the surface of resist during electron beam exposure. However, some side effects are introduced to the mask-making process. The resolution performance of chemically amplified resist (CAR) is degraded owing to acid diffusion from the CDL components to the resist surface. A newly developed CDL solved this problem by controlling the acid diffusion. A positive-tone CAR with the CDL showed no resolution degradation, and performance was maintained for over 30 days after coating CDL and resist. Furthermore, the CDL has been evaluated on a negative-tone CAR which is more sensitive to CDL.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is the leading candidate for sub-20nm half-pitch (hp) patterning solution, but the development of a high-output light source is still in progress thereby delaying the adoption of EUV for mass production. The evolution of 193nm immersion lithography-an exposure technology currently used in the mass production of all advanced devices-must therefore be extended, and to this end, self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP) processes have come to be used to achieve further down scaling. To date, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of self-aligned double patterning (SADP) and self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) as innovative processes and have reported on world-first scaling results at SPIE on several occasions. However, for critical layers in FinFET devices that presume a 1D cell design, there is also a need not just for the scaling of grating patterns but also for line-cutting techniques (grating and cutting). Under the theme of existing- technology extension to sub-10nm logic nodes, this paper presents the potential solutions of sub-10nm hp resolution by self-aligned octuple patterning (SAOP) and discusses the limits of shrink technology in cutting patterns.", "Masks used for sub-20 nm half pitch of devices are required to be defect-free as well as to have more complicate and smaller patterns. For higher resolution for sub-20 nm device, the masks that can provide wider process windows on wafers are made using new e-beam resists and new mask materials. An introduction of advanced mask systems needs methodologies to overcome defect challenges that did not occur at previous mask systems. The defects should be related with chemical and physical properties from negative and positive e-beam resists or/and new type blanks used for advanced masks such as EUV or optical masks. As a mask pattern size is shrunken, the masks also have complicate structures and different surface properties from low end mask systems. Defect removal on the masks is important even at a develop process among mask manufacturing processes. This paper reports that advanced technology applications on mask develop processes have been performed to remove defects on the masks. First, a new rinse system has applied into a mask develop process for defect reduction. Second, a new develop process was also performed to remove defects on masks. The new develop process combined with the new rinse system has reduced more than 50% of defects including e-beam resist residue defects and other defects. This paper mainly focuses on defects related to negative and positive resists on masks and their solutions to reduce or/and remove the defects, which are used for sub-20 nm half pitch of devices, in terms of mask develop process.", "The optical projection technique with evolution of Exposure wave length (\u03bb) and Numerical Aperture (NA) has been historically driven Photolithographic scaling. Although the delay of EUV tool for HVM has been concerned, scaling is going on steadily after limitation of 193nm-immersion technique. Double patterning process has been firstly adopted in 30nm node device of memory device, and evolved step by step from SADP, SAQP to SAOP [1][2][3]. Self-Aligned Multiple-Patterning (SAMP) with 193-immersion is getting most promising technology for further downwards scaling at the present. For the extension of 193-immersion, many solutions in mask and illumination area were suggested, and these are represented by SMO (Source and Mask Optimization) and linked to \u201cComputational lithography\u201d. Furthermore, the change of device layout design to 1D (Single directional) layout [4] is the solution to mitigate several process issues, which are represented by process variability, pattern fidelity and Edge placement error (EPE). This paper presents the results of observing pattern fidelity in the multiple patterning process from many aspects and the results of testing a technique for high-accuracy management of pattern fidelity in 1D layout.", "The Cost of Ownership (CoO) for semiconductor processing has been primarily dominated by lithography. In multiple patterning processes, additional materials and the impact to throughput of multiple patterning passes appear to become additional major contributors to manufacturing cost as well. We introduce SiOxNy hardmask as a new memorization layer for multiple patterning that addresses the non-lithographic cost contributor to manufacturing. The optical constants of the SiOxNy hardmask are matched to those of the photoresist at the imaging wavelength, and that makes it invisible at the exposure wavelength, enabling lithography directly over the hardmask topography, while at the same time it will be visible to those wavelengths that are used for alignment and overlay. The SiOxNy hardmask is inserted below the photoresist which will make the rework and integration schemes much simpler and result in cost savings by replacing only photoresist layers during multiple patterning processes. Additionally, by eliminating the need for traditional spincast planarization and the associated tri-layer etch we can improve the critical dimension uniformity (CDU) and reduce proximity contributions from etch, and their respective etch proximity corrections. In this work, we engineered the lithographic stack to be compatible with the invisible SiOxNy hardmask. Lithographic process windows, CDU, and LER/LWR are compared with conventional tri-layer stack and we demonstrate triple patterning memorized into the SiOxNy hardmask after which patterns are then transferred, at once, into the bottom integrated stack. Finally, major benefits of using the invisible hardmask on device scaling and patterning challenges are discussed, such as for LE2, LE3, and trench and cut patterning.", "Implementation of Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) as a viable lithographic technology for high volume manufacturing will require significant efforts to co-optimize the DSA process options and constraints with existing work flows. These work flows include established etch stacks, integration schemes, and design layout principles. The two foremost patterning schemes for DSA, chemoepitaxy and graphoepitaxy, each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Chemoepitaxy is well suited for regular repeating patterns, but has challenges when non-periodic design elements are required. As the line-space polystyrene-block-polymethylmethacrylate chemoepitaxy DSA processes mature, considerable progress has been made on reducing the density of topological (dislocation and disclination) defects but little is known about the existence of 3D buried defects and their subsequent pattern transfer to underlayers. In this paper, we highlight the emergence of a specific type of buried bridging defect within our two 28 nm pitch DSA flows and summarize our efforts to characterize and eliminate the buried defects using process, materials, and plasma-etch optimization. We also discuss how the optimization and removal of the buried defects impacts both the process window and pitch multiplication, facilitates measurement of the pattern roughness rectification, and demonstrate hard-mask open within a back-end-of-line integration flow. Finally, since graphoepitaxy has intrinsic benefits in terms of design flexibility when compared to chemoepitaxy, we highlight our initial investigations on implementing high-chi block copolymer patterning using multiple graphoepitaxy flows to realize sub-20 nm pitch line-space patterns and discuss the benefits of using high-chi block copolymers for roughness reduction.", "The nanometer range structure produced by thin films of diblock copolymers makes them a great of interest as templates for the microelectronics industry. We investigated the effect of annealing solvents and/or mixture of the solvents in case of symmetric Poly (styrene-block-4vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) diblock copolymer to get the desired line patterns. In this paper, we used different molecular weights PS-b-P4VP to demonstrate the scalability of such high \u03c7 BCP system which requires precise fine-tuning of interfacial energies achieved by surface treatment and that improves the wetting property, ordering, and minimizes defect densities. Bare Silicon Substrates were also modified with polystyrene brush and ethylene glycol self-assembled monolayer in a simple quick reproducible way. Also, a novel and simple in situ hard mask technique was used to generate sub-7nm Iron oxide nanowires with a high aspect ratio on Silicon substrate, which can be used to develop silicon nanowires post pattern transfer.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) of block copolymers is a candidate advanced patterning technology at future technology nodes. Although DSA promises resolution and cost benefits, a number of constraints and challenges remain for its implementation. Poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) has been widely studied in DSA and applied in various applications to demonstrate the potential of DSA to extend optical lithography, including line space and contact hole patterning and uniformity repair,. However, the relatively weak segregation strength of PS-b-PMMA limits its capability to pattern sub-10 nm features. This paper presents the use of strongly segregated high X block copolymers to enable sub-10 nm patterning. Chemoepitaxy DSA with high X lamellar block copolymers is demonstrated with two different strategies based on thermal annealing process and no top coat. These technologies hold promise to enable the implementation of DSA at future technology nodes.", "Material evolution has been a key enabler of lithography nodes in the last 30 years. This paper explores the evolution of anti-reflective coatings and their transformation from materials that provide only reflection control to advanced multifunctional layers. It is expected that complementary processes that do not require a change in wavelength will continue to dominate the development of new devices and technology nodes. New device architecture, immersion lithography, negative-tone development, multiple patterning, and directed self-assembly have demonstrated the capabilities of extending lithography nodes beyond what anyone thought would be possible. New material advancements for future technology nodes are proposed.", "Carbon rich hard mask underlayer (UL) material deposition has become inevitable process in all advanced lithography applications. UL processes which include chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and spin-on UL play a very important role for pattern transfer from patterned thin photoresist to the substrate. UL materials must satisfy several requirements, which have become more demanding with device shrinkage and increasing device complexity (FinFET, 3D integration). The most important properties of next generation UL materials are superior wiggle resistance, etch controllability, thermal resistance, planarization, and gap filling performance. In particular, planarization and gap fill properties of UL material for application on topo-patterned substrate are receiving much attention recently. CVD processes generally give better wiggle performance and thermal resistance, but poorer planarization and gap filling performance than spin-on UL processes. In addition, Cost of Ownership (CoO) of CVD process is higher than that of a spin-on UL process. Therefore spin-on organic hard mask (OHM) process has been investigated as an attractive alternative to CVD processing. In this paper, we focus on an investigation of key properties of spin-on UL materials for achieving good planarity and gap filling performance on topo-patterned substrate. Various material properties such as solution viscosity, glass transition temperature (Tg), and film shrinkage ratio were evaluated and correlations between these properties and planarization were discussed.", "Tri-layer process is the one of the key technique both for lithography and etching around Hp20nm patterning. In applying for tri-layer process, we are focusing on inorganic type under layer which mainly containing Si atoms. This Si type hard mask (Si-HM) can perform not only as the Lithography performance enhancement layer for fine pitch, but also as the etching hard mask against bottom layer (spin on carbon : SOC). In this paper, we propose our new Si-HM concepts to achieve high sensitivity, wide process window and good line edge roughness for hp 1Xnm generation. The key point of our concepts is EUV sensitive unit in Si-HM. Our EUV sensitive unit strongly promotes acid generation from PAG of EUV photo resist. Especially, for EUV NTD lithography process, EUV sensitive unit can perform as the adhesion enhancer between Si-HM and photo resist at EUV exposed area. As this result, hp18nm L/S pattern and hp24nm C/H pattern were successfully achieved by applying the EUV sensitive Si-HM in EUV PTD process. Especially, as compared to organic UL, the 4th generation EUV sensitive Si-HM showed 5~10% higher sensitivity and 10~25% wider process window (DOF and EL) with keeping LER. Moreover this EUV-sensitive Si-HM could also enhance the ultimate resolution to Hp22nm L/S in EUV NTD process. On the other hand, from the view point of etching hard mask, around hp 19 nm Si-HM L/S pattern could be transferred to SOC layer successfully. We will present the high resolution concepts and performances of our latest EUV sensitive Si-HM for 1X nm generation in EUV lithography.", "Shot noise is a significant issue in EUV lithography, especially in printing small area features like contact holes. This brings about LCDU (Local CD Uniformity) issue and LCDU-sensitivity tradeoff. This paper describes efforts to alleviate this issue through a novel EUV Underlayer (UL) chemistry design approach. The novel component \u201cbuffer\u201d was introduced into EUV UL formulations to balance back exposure energy from UL to the resist at different incident positions. Measured back exposure dose from UL shows much lower variation (6\u03c3/mean) compared with shot noise of resist absorbed dose. Thus summed energy variation will be suppressed when counting back exposure effect of UL, namely shot noise is reduced. Through reported shot noise model, our calculation suggests 30% sensitivity improvement and 13.4% shot noise suppression can be expected. Actual lithographic evaluations demonstrated simultaneous LCDU and sensitivity improvement. The feasibility of 30% sensitivity improvement by Metal hard mask (MHM) material was tested. The combination of buffer functionalized UL and MHM was modeled.", "With extreme UV not ready for HVM for the 20nm and 14nm nodes, double patterning options that extend the use of 193nm immersion lithography beyond the optical resolution limits, such as LELE (Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch) and SADP (Self Aligned Double Patterning), are being used for critical layers for these nodes. LELE requires very stringent overlay capability of the optical exposure tool. The spacer scheme of SADP starts with a conformal film of material around the mandrels and etched along the mandrel sidewalls to form patterns with doubled frequency. SADP, while having the advantage of being a self-aligned process, adds a number of process steps and strict control of the mandrel profile is required. In this paper, we will demonstrate a novel technique - ASDP (Anti-Spacer Double Patterning), which uses only spin-on materials to achieve self-aligned double patterning. After initial resist patterning, an Anti-Spacer Generator (ASG) material is coated on the resist pattern to create the developable spacer region. Another layer of material is then coated and processed to generate the second pattern in between the first resist pattern. We were able to define 37.5nm half pitch pattern features using this technique as well as sub-resolution features for an asymmetric pattern. In this paper we will review the capability of the process in terms of CD control and LWR (line width roughness) and discuss the limitations of the process.", "While the technological progress of Next Generation Lithography (NGL) steadily continues, further progress is required before successful insertion in high volume manufacturing is possible. A key issue is the development of new resists suitable to achieve higher lithographic resolution with acceptable sensitivity and line edge roughness. Molecular resists have been a primary focus of interest for NGL because they promise high resolution and small line edge roughness (LER), but no suitable resist candidate has emerged yet that fulfills all of the industry\u2019s criteria. We have previously shown first extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) exposures for a new fullerene derivative based three-component negative tone chemically amplified resist with suitable properties close to or within the target range of the resist metrics as set out in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors for 2016. Here we present the results of our efforts to optimize the EUVL performance of our resist system especially with regards to LER.", "A combination of ICP-OES, titration, and Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the ratio of peroxide to hafnium in the inorganic photoresist HafSOx. By using ICP-OES to determine the hafnium concentration and titration with permanganate to determine peroxide in a solution of dissolved films, the Hf:O22- ratio was found to be approximately 2:1 in the films. From Raman measurements on precursor solutions, it was determined that that Hfbound peroxide saturated at this level. Film insolubility is induced through loss of approximately 75% of bound peroxide following exposure to a 30-keV electron beam.", "We have studied the photolysis of tin clusters of the type [(RSn)12O14(OH)6] X2 using extreme ultraviolet (EUV, 13.5 nm) light, and developed these clusters into novel high-resolution photoresists. A thin film of [(BuSn)12O14(OH)6][p-toluenesulfonate]2 (1) was prepared by spin coating a solution of (1) in 2-butanone onto a silicon wafer. Exposure to EUV light caused the compound (1) to be converted into a substance that was markedly less soluble in aqueous isopropanol. To optimize the EUV lithographic performance of resists using tin-oxo clusters, and to gain insight into the mechanism of their photochemical reactions, we prepared several compounds based on [(RSn)12O14(OH)6] X2. The sensitivity of tin-oxide films to EUV light were studied as a function of variations in the structure of the counter-anions (X, primarily carboxylates) and organic ligands bound to tin (R). Correlations were sought between the EUV sensitivity of these complexes vs. the strength of the carbon-carboxylate bonds in the counteranions and vs. the strength of the carbon-tin bonds. No correlation was observed between the strength of the carboncarboxylate bonds in the counter-anions (X) and the EUV photosensitivity. However, the EUV sensitivity of the tinoxide films appears to be well-correlated with the strength of the carbon-tin bonds. We hypothesize this correlation indicates a mechanism of carbon-tin bond homolysis during exposure. Using these tin clusters, 18-nm lines were printed showcasing the high resolution capabilities of these materials as photoresists for EUV lithography.", "EUV resist materials are requested simultaneously to improve the resolution, line-edge roughness (LER), and sensitivity (RLS). In a resist film inhomogeneous structures in nanometer region may have large effects on directly the resolution and LER and indirectly on sensitivity. Inhomogeneity of PAGs in a hybrid resist for EUV lithography was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The hybrid resist film showed the inhomogeneous positions and motions of PAG cations and anions. Free volumes in resist matrix influence the motions of PAGs. Molecular structure such as bulky phenyl groups of a PAG cation localize the positions and reduce the motion of a cation. Chemical properties such as ionic interactions and lone-pair interaction also play an important role to determine the inhomogeneity of PAGs. Fluorine interaction enables active motions of PAG anions.", "EUV lithography is one of the most promising techniques for sub-20nm half-pitch HVM devices, however it is well known that EUVL solutions still face significant challenges. Therefore we have focused on 193 immersion extension by using a self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP), and this technique easily enables fine periodical patterning. Spacer patterning techniques have already been applied to sub-20nm hp advanced devices. In general, SAMP consists of SADP, SATP, SAQP, etc. We have already introduced about evolutional schemes and cost effective processes in past SPIE sessions.[1-12] SAQP enable further down-scaling to 10nm hp from SADP levels, however we must consider next advanced solution for sub-10nm hp resolution. In this paper, we will discuss about a possibility of 193 immersion extension using SAOP (self-aligned octuple patterning).", "Wet particle reduction during filter installation and start-up aligns closely with initiatives to reduce both chemical consumption and preventative maintenance time. The present study focuses on the effects of filter materials cleanliness on wet particle defectivity through evaluation of filters that have been treated with a new enhanced cleaning process focused on organic compounds reduction. Little difference in filter performance is observed between the two filter types at a size detection threshold of 60 nm, while clear differences are observed at that of 26 nm. It can be suggested that organic compounds can be identified as a potential source of wet particles. Pall recommends filters that have been treated with the special cleaning process for applications with a critical defect size of less than 60 nm. Standard filter products are capable to satisfy wet particle defect performance criteria in less critical lithography applications.", "It is known that DUV resist filtration using Nylon 6,6 membrane significantly reduces microbridge defects. Previous work has described a method to determine an adsorption performance index using modified metal nanoparticles, which simulate interactions with microbridge defect precursors. In this paper, the effects of filter grade, filter material, and solvent type on adsorptive retention are explored. The adsorption rate in Nylon 6,6 40 nm filter was observed to be greater in both lower-LogPow and lower-viscosity solvents, possibly providing a direction for improved filtration performance based on the solvent properties. The complementary adsorption kinetics parameters give a more accurate suggestion for the filter performance in lithography applications combined with the conventional sieving filter ratings.", "Thick photoresists, e.g. up to 1 mm layer thickness, are widely used for the manufacture of high aspect ratio microstructures, e.g. as mould for the fabrication of metallic micro parts. Such resists or materials exhibit high mechanical and chemical stability to non-deformably withstand a pattern transfer process, e.g. by electroplating. After the pattern transfer a solvent based removal is difficult or not possible in many cases. A selective mould removal \u2013 without the damage of electroplated metal structures \u2013 is required for the fabrication of single micro parts. As second application example UV curable and strongly crosslinkable inorganic-organic hybrid polymers such as OrmoComp \u00ae and OrmoStamp \u00ae are used in UV moulding. The cleaning and rework of these moulds or also of stamps for nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a challenging task with increasing importance. The life time of an expensive master mould or stamp as well as of the replicated working stamps is important, and therefore the ability to rework such stamps without any defect or decreased resolution. Hence, we demonstrate the application of a plasma-assisted removal using the STP 2020 etching tool from MUEGGE [1] for remote dry etching of strongly crosslinked materials, i.e. the development of processes for the isotropical etching of highly crosslinked photoresists and hybrid polymer materials will be presented. In combination with this specific etching tool this technique shows a high potential to make plasma-assisted removal ready for industrial production.", "For better understanding of electron beam resist processes, it is important to characterize the resist materials on the basis of their reaction mechanisms. In this study, the basic parameters which characterize the chemical reactions for latent image formation upon exposure to electron beam were evaluated. The electron beam resist used was a chemically amplified resist, the backbone polymer of which is poly(4-hydroxystyrene). 49% of the hydroxyl groups were protected with t-butoxycarbonyl groups. The stopping power was 0.529 eV nm-1. The G-value of acid generation was 2.5. The effective reaction radius for deprotection was approximately 0.02 nm. The diffusion constant of acids was 1.3 nm2 s-1. The diffusion constant of quenchers was significantly lower than that of acids. The product of LER and chemical gradient (dm/dx) was approximately 0.06.", "Microlithography uses a variety of resists and polymer materials to create patterns and lithographic structures on several types of substrates. Excellent adhesion of the resists and polymers to the substrate is a prerequisite for successful patterning and pattern transfer. This paper presents the results of an investigation of the effects of an adhesion promoter, SurPass, on the lithographic process when used in combination with a variety of resists, and substrate materials. SurPass is a waterborne, non-hazardous, cationic organic surface active agent that promotes adhesion by modifying the substrate surface energy without deposition, chemical change or impact on electrical properties of the substrate material. The effectiveness of SurPass in combination with several novolac and epoxy resists on various substrate materials will be presented.", "The demands imposed by shrinking design rules for sub 20 nm technology on lithographic resolution are driving many avenues of research and development in an attempt to provide a robust and affordable solution for high volume manufacturing. Currently, pitch splitting techniques, such as self-aligned double and quadruple patterning (SADP or SAQP) and litho-etch litho-etch \u2026(LELE\u2026), are being used to bridge the gap to next generation ;lithographic techniques. Cost of ownership (CoO), process window improvements and defectivity are opportunities and concerns for extensions of these approaches, such as resist sliming on sidewall-image transfer (SIT) processes like SADP or SAQP. A spin-on resist slimming approach is implemented with line and space resist to explore process window improvements. The effects of typical process conditions and incoming variability are studied using a custom design of experiments. The optimized process is then used to evaluate process window gain compared to the process of record.", "The acid-catalyzed deprotection of glassy poly(4-hydroxystyrene-co-tert butyl acrylate) \ufb01lms was studied with infrared absorbance spectroscopy and stochastic simulations. Experimental data were interpreted with a simple description of subdi\ufb00usive acid transport coupled to second-order acid loss. This model predicts key attributes of observed deprotection rates, such as fast reaction at short times, slow reaction at long times, and a non-linear dependence on acid loading. The degree of anomalous character is reduced by increasing the post-exposure bake temperature or adding plasticizing agents to the polymer resin. These \ufb01ndings indicate that the acid mobility and overall deprotection kinetics are coupled to glassy matrix dynamics. Furthermore, the acid di\ufb00usion lengths were calculated from the anomalous transport model and compared with nanopattern line widths. The consistent scaling between experiments and simulations suggests that the anomalous di\ufb00usion model could be further developed into a predictive lithography tool.", "Poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS), a backbone polymer in resist constituents is also a promising material for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and electron beam (EB) lithography. Efficient deprotonation occurs from radical cations of irradiated PHS. A hydroxystyrene unit is incorporated in the chemically amplified resist structure as a proton source, in which reaction mechanism has not been well established. In this study, deprotonation mechanism of an ionized PHS was characterized by using pulse radiolysis techniques. The influence of several additives such as sulfoxides and amides with high acidity on the kinetics of the deprotonation was investigated to clarify the fundamentals of the enhancement of deprotonation efficiency from the PHS radical cation. Influence of the additives on the acid yield in thin film was also investigated.", "The screen size growth of mobile displays is accompanied with the drastically increased resolution. A display should have high pixel resolution to meet demanding readability and legibility expectations. The manufacturing process should be advanced to meet final device requirements. One of the important process steps is the post-development hardbake, where resist reflow is used to tune the final profile which influences subsequent process steps. Moreover, 3D resist profiles become one of critical design factors for mechanical and optical properties of display pixels. The resist reflow is the main time- and temperature-dependent effect of post-development bake process step. Since the resist is in transitional state (crystalline glassy/amorphous rubbery/viscous melt) the resist profile dynamics are very complex and predictive modeling is necessary. The model presented in this paper is based on a lattice-Boltzmann method, where the resist is considered as multicomponent (polymer-solvent) and multiphase (solid-liquid-vapor) mixture. Simulated resist profile dynamics with time are analyzed in dependency of material parameters (solvent diffusivity and evaporation rate, polymer solid fraction and adhesion with substrate). Temperature-dependent parameter descriptions are used for model calibration. Validation against experimental data shows good model consistency and predictability, demonstrating the benefit of simulation in process development and optimization.", "In order to understand the mechanism of line width roughness (LWR) generation and to find control knobs for improving resist patterning properties, we developed precise direct analysis method of resist patterns. This method comprise three important processes: 1. Selective sampling of resist pattern surface and pattern core, 2. Analysis and preparative isolation of collected resist ingredient by \u03bcGPC, 3. Structural analysis by Py-GC/MS. \u03bcGPC and Py-GC/MS analysis provid resist ingredient distribution information inside resist pattern, which includes original polymer, reacted polymer, and photo acid generator (PAG) through the ArF patterning process. This novel analytical method can provide remarkably helpful information about identifying proper control knobs for lithographic performance of ArF resist and for next generation lithography (NGL), especially extreme ultra violet lithography (EUVL) materials, where exposure tool time is very limited.", "Spin-on dielectric (SOD) is widely used in semiconductor industry, to form insulating layers including shallow trench isolation (STI) or inter-layer dielectrics (ILD). SOD has several advantages over high density plasma chemical vapor deposition (HDP-CVD) for manufacturing process, such as less defect and higher throughput. However, both SOD and HDP-CVD have a drawback, which is a high temperature curing process required to make pure silicon oxide layers. High temperature curing could cause high stress and thermal distortion. These disadvantages are becoming more problematic as the semiconductor device shrinks. To resolve the problem, we tested several additives to moderate the curing temperature. It was found out that amine compounds were effective to convert SOD polymer into silicon oxide, therefore the curing process could be performed at a lower temperature. We also observed that the SOD films containing amine additives have higher etch resistance during a wet etch process. These results, as well as the lower curing temperature, are beneficial for manufacturing insulating layers. Further investigation is ongoing to characterize other film properties of the SOD with additives, and to optimize the formulation conditions according to the requirements of manufacturing processes.", "Our past research on measurements of simulation parameters for ArF resists focused on establishing methods for measuring the following parameters:[1]-[4] \u2022 Development parameters[1] \u2022 PEB parameters[2] \u2022 Dill\u2019s ABC parameters[3] \u2022 Quencher parameter[4] We entered these parameters into a lithography simulator and performed ArF resist simulations.We then explored ways to optimize the ArF resist material and process. This paper reports on our study of methods for measuring the diffusion length of acid generated from PAG during exposures. In our experiment, we applied a PAG-containing top coat (TC) material (second layer) to a PAG-free ArF resist (first layer), then performed the exposure and PEB processes. The acid generated in the TC during the exposure diffused into the ArF resist in the lower layer (first layer) when PEB was performed. The process of developing this sample removed the TC in the second layer and the parts of the first layer into which the acid had diffused.We obtained the acid diffusion length based on the quantity of film removed by the development. We calculated the acid diffusion coefficient after varying the exposure value and repeating the measurement. For this report, we also performed measurements to determine how differences in PAG anion size, amount of quencher additive, and PEB temperature affected the acid diffusion coefficient.We entered the measurements obtained into the PROLITH simulator and explored the effects of acid diffusion on pattern profile.", "Chemically amplified resists have been widely used in the mass production line. An acid generation mechanism induced by ionizing radiation with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and electron beam is an important issue for improvement of the resist performance such as sensitivity, roughness, and resolution below 16 nm. However, the details of deprotonation kinetics from the ionized resist solid film immediately after the ionization have been still unclear. In this study, pulse radiolysis of highly concentrated poly(4-hydroxystylene) (PHS) solutions was performed. The viscosity dependence on the deprotonation dynamics of the ionized concentrated solutions was investigated to clarify the proton generation of ionized PHS in a medium with low mobility. The deprotonation from the PHS radical cation becomes slower with increasing PHS concentration. It is suggested that the deprotonation reaction is slower in a less mobile medium because of decrease of the molecular motions.", "New inorganic resist materials based on metal complexes were investigated for atomic force microscope (AFM) lithography. Phosphoric acids are good for self-assembly because of their strong binding energy. In this work, zirconium phosphonate system are newly synthesized for spin-coatable materials in aqueous solutions and leads to negative tone pattern for improving line edge roughness. Low electron exposure by AFM lithography could generate a pattern by electrochemical reaction and cross-linking of metal-oxo complexes. It has been reported that the minimum pattern results are affected by lithographic speed, and the applied voltage between a tip and a substrate.", "Herein, we describe preliminary results on organic-inorganic hybrid photoresists, capable of showing line patterns up to 16 nm under e-beam exposure studies, prepared by incorporating polyoxometalates (POMs) clusters into organic photoresist materials. Various Mo and W based clusters such as (TBA)2[Mo6O19], (TBA)5(H)[P2V3W15O62] and (TBA)4[P2Mo18O61] (where TBA = tetrabutyl ammonium counter ion) have been incorporated into PMMA matrix by mixing POM solutions and standard PMMA polymer in anisole (MW ~ 95000, MicroChem) in 1:33 w/v ratio. E-beam exposure followed by development with MIBK solutions showed that these new organic-inorganic hybrid photoresists show good line patterns upto 16 nm, which were not observed in the case of control experiments done on pure PMMA polymer resist. The observed enhancement of resist properties in the case of hybrid resists could possibly be due to a combination of features imparted to the resist by the POM clusters such as increased sensitivity, etch resistance and thermal stability.", "Spin-on-carbon (SOC) hard mask is useful for multilayer lithography process because of its high etch resistance, low cost of ownership, low defectivity, high alignment accuracy, good gap filling and planarization for topography. SOC is a high carbon containing polymer solution and as a coating material, the polymers need to be soluble in organic solvent and insoluble after curing for coating upper layer materials. High carbon content (>80%) of SOC is very important for good etch resistance. As the semiconductor industry is moving to 2X nm node and beyond, further improvement of SOC properties mentioned above is required to achieve higher resolution. We synthesized a series of novel monomers and high carbon polymers applicable for SOC applications of advanced nodes. The optimized SOC was a PGMEA based formulation, had high carbon content 90%, excellent filling/leveling properties, and adequate etching properties applicable to trilayer process. The SOC successfully transferred patterns from resist into substrate and the SOC patterns did not show deformation or wiggling down to CD 40nm. This paper describes some of the SOC polymer chemistry and the performance of an optimized SOC formulation.", "To meet Moore\u2019s law, resist resolution improvement has become more and more important. However, it is difficult to improve resist resolution and keep vertical sidewall profile. For example, a high contrast hole resist may cause trench scum, due to very T-top profile. This paper reports several concepts for resist profile tuning without losing performance for lithographic factor , including mask error enhancement factor (MEEF), depth of focus (DOF), and critical dimension uniformity (CDU). To quantitative analysis the resist profile improvement, we define a new factor, Scum fail ratio (F/R%) for new techniques evaluation. The new techniques, including floatable additive, floatable PAG, and new monomer, are discussed. From X-SEM and CD-SEM data, former three concepts could improve resist sidewall profile quantitatively evaluated by Scum fail F/R% and keep lithographic factors. In addition, another key factor, resist residue defect, is also discussed. The high contrast resist with higher receding contact angle (RCA) easily generates more residue defect after development. With the new monomer composition, RCA of Resist E is decreased from 54 to 48 degree after development. Therefore, the residue defect is improved one order.", "Novel resist materials are required for lithographic processing with ionization radiation such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and electron beam (EB) exposure tool. In this study, we developed positive-tone chemically amplified molecular resists based on noria derivatives and calixarene derivatives and evaluated the lithographic performance using EUV and EB. We make clear that a small change in modification of noria resists can cause a significant change of sensitivity. Especially, it is useful for the improvement of resist sensitivities to use protecting groups such as 2-acetyloxy-2-methyladamantyl ester (AD) groups and ethoxy groups. Also, novel calixarene derivative such as pillar[5]arene protected by AD showed a semi-isolated pattern with the line width of 40 nm (pitch: 100nm). Noria derivatives and calixarene derivative resists were promising candidates because of high sensitivity, high resolution and etch durability similar to conventional resist such as ZEP 520A and UVIII.", "A novel adhesion promoting material has been developed to prevent very small resist patterns from collapse. One target for the development of the material is to make an advanced negative-tone mask with 40 nm sub-resolution assist features (SRAF). The SRAF on photomasks has become shorter and shorter as well as narrowing. The 2-dimensional resist patterns easily collapse during the resist developing process. Resist under-coating material controlled the surface condition on a chrome absorber film, and it improved the resolution of the SRAF. As a result, SRAFs of 46nm width and 200nm length were achieved using the material. A negative-tone resist on the under-coating layer demonstrated 35 nm isolated line patterns on a mask without pattern collapse.", "In our previous paper, we reported the development of new xanthendiol derivatives applied to the negative-tone molecular resists for EB/EUVL. We also reported the EB patterning result showed the resist containing the new xanthendiol, 13-biphenyl-13H-benzoxanthen-3,10-diol, could resolve the 30 nm half-pitch pattern. In this paper, we report the resist containing the new xanthendiol could resolve the 20 nm half-pitch pattern without pattern collapse by optimizing formulation and conditions. Furthermore 15 nm half-pitch patterns were partially resolved. And the EUVL patterning result also shows 20 nm half-pitch pattern.", "Negative tone shrink materials (NSM) suitable for resolution enhancement of negative tone development (NTD) 193nm immersion resists have been developed. While this technology is being applied to integrated circuits (IC) manufacturing, reduction of shrink differences between isolated and dense (ID) CDs also called as shrink ID bias is the challenge to meet wide-spread applications. In this paper, we present the effects of resist thermal flow, proximity effects of DUV exposure, flood exposure of after developed image (ADI) on the NSM shrink. High mixing bake (MB) temperature (example 170\u00b0C) during the shrink process resulted in increased resist thermal flow leading to worse shrink ID bias of 3.5 nm. As different pitch pattern has different proximity effect and matching with illumination condition, uneven dose is expected on them. These differences in dose required to obtain same through pitch (1:X, X-1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5) CD was assigned as the cause for shrink ID bias as the de-protection chemistry is related to dose which affects the shrink amount. This was further confirmed by flood exposure of after developed image (ADI) which reduced shrink ID bias from 3.5 nm to 1.8 nm. We concluded that the flood exposure makes the ADIs of the resist chemically uniform thereby minimizing shrink ID bias. Based on these studies, a mechanism for shrink ID bias is proposed. A modified NSM with 1.2 nm shrink ID bias has been developed without the need for the flood exposure."], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
