A series of mechanistic studies followed the production of reaction byproducts by mass spectrometer, as they left the film during exposure to EUV photons and 80 eV electrons. We identified several prominent outgassing fragments and their rates of production as a function of ligand structure. The degree of outgassing appears to be well-correlated with the bond dissociation energy of the carboxylate ligand R\u2019 group. Furthermore, a deuterium labeling study was conducted to determine from which ligand hydrogen is abstracted to form benzene and phenol during exposure. Benzene and phenol were found to abstract hydrogen from opposing sites within the film, and with greater than 95% isotopic purity. Using the results of the outgassing studies alongside established mechanisms for electron-induced reactions; a series of reaction pathways were proposed to generate the aforementioned outgassing species and a possible nonvolatile negative-tone photoproduct.", "EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography is one of the most promising candidates for next generation lithography. The main challenge for EUV resists is to simultaneously satisfy resolution, LWR (line-width roughness) and sensitivity requirements according to the ITRS roadmap. Though polymer type CAR (chemically amplified resist) is the currently standard photoresist, entirely new resist platforms are required due to the performance targets of smaller process nodes. In this paper, recent progress in nanoparticle photoresists which Cornell University has intensely studied is discussed. Lithography performance, especially scum elimination, improvement studies with the dissolution rate acceleration concept and new metal core applications are described.", "Pure thin-films of unimolecular organometallic photoresists were lithographically evaluated using extreme ultraviolet light (EUV, \u03bb = 13.5 nm) and developed using solutions containing carboxylic acids. Optimization of development solutions used with a cobalt-oxalate EUV resist (NP1, 2) led to a switch in lithographic tone from negative to positive. Additional optimization led to an improvement in top loss (35 to 7%) with development in cyclohexanone and 2-butanone, respectively. We saw a drastic improvement in photo-speed (Emax = 5 mJ/cm2) and contrast of the negative-tone imaging with development in certain acidic solutions. Additionally, carboxylic acid solutions provide excellent development conditions for resists that we, in the past, have been unable to successfully develop.", "The experimental measurement of the time-dependent absorption of photoresists at extreme ultraviolet wavelength is of great interest for the modeling of the lithographic process. So far, several technical challenges have made the accurate determination of the linear absorption coefficient and the Dill parameters nontrivial. In this work, we use a dedicated equipment and synchrotron light source to experimentally measure the transmittance of thin layers of photoresists on transparent silicon nitride membranes, and their thickness was measured with the spectroscopic ellipsometry. The absorption of negative tone photo-condensed metal oxide photoresists based on Sn cage structures, and of Zr and Hf oxoclusters was measured and compared to the estimated values. It was found that tin based materials absorb considerably more light than conventional chemically amplified resists based on organic polymer. Hafnium-based materials have about twice absorption, while zirconium based are basically comparable to organic resists. Furthermore, the exposure kinetics of several chemically amplified resists with varying photo-acid concentration and backbone polymer was studied. The rate of bleaching, described by the Dill parameter C, was measured and conclusions are drawn based on the specific resist formulation.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography at 13.5 nm stands at the crossroads of next generation patterning technology for high volume manufacturing of integrated circuits. Photo resist models that form the part of overall pattern transform model for lithography play a vital role in supporting this effort. The physics and chemistry of these resists must be understood to enable the construction of accurate models for EUV Optical Proximity Correction (OPC). In this study, we explore the possibility of improving EUV photo-resist models by directly correlating the parameters obtained from experimentally measured atomic scale physical properties; namely, the effect of interaction of EUV photons with photo acid generators in standard chemically amplified EUV photoresist, and associated electron energy loss events. Atomic scale physical properties will be inferred from the measurements carried out in Electron Resist Interaction Chamber (ERIC). This study will use measured physical parameters to establish a relationship with lithographically important properties, such as line edge roughness and CD variation. The data gathered from these measurements is used to construct OPC models of the resist.", "With the introduction of its fifth-generation EUV scanner, the NXE:3400B, ASML has brought EUV to High-Volume Manufacturing for sub-10nm node lithography. This paper presents lithographic performance results obtained with the NXE:3400B, characterized by an NA of 0.33, a Pupil Fill Ratio (PFR) of 0.2 and throughput capability of 125 wafers per hour (or wph).\nAdvances in source power have enabled a further increase of tool productivity requiring an associated increase of stage scan speeds. To maximize the number of yielding die per day a stringent Overlay, Focus, and Critical Dimension (CD) control is required. Tight CD control at improved resolution is obtained through a number of innovations: the NXE:3400B features lower aberration levels and a revolutionary new illumination system, offering improved pupil-fill ratio and larger sigma range. Overlay and Focus are further improved by implementation of a new wafer clamp and improved scanner controls.\nThe NXE:3400B also offers full support for reticle pellicles.", "Our paper will use stochastic simulations to explore how EUV pattern roughness can cause device failure through rare events, so-called \"black swans\". We examine the impact of stochastic noise on the yield of simple wiring patterns with 36nm pitch, corresponding to 7nm node logic, using a local Critical Dimension (CD)-based fail criteria Contact hole failures are examined in a similar way. For our nominal EUV process, local CD uniformity variation and local Pattern Placement Error variation was observed, but no pattern failures were seen in the modest (few thousand) number of features simulated. We degraded the image quality by incorporating Moving Standard Deviation (MSD) blurring to degrade the Image Log-Slope (ILS), and were able to find conditions where pattern failures were observed. We determined the Line Width Roughness (LWR) value as a function of the ILS. By use of an artificial \"step function\" image degraded by various MSD blur, we were able to extend the LWR vs ILS curve into regimes that might be available for future EUV imagery. As we decreased the image quality, we observed LWR grow and also began to see pattern failures. For high image quality, we saw CD distributions that were symmetrical and close to Gaussian in shape. Lower image quality caused CD distributions that were asymmetric, with \"fat tails\" on the low CD side (under-exposed) which were associated with pattern failures. Similar non-Gaussian CD distributions were associated with image conditions that caused missing contact holes, i.e. CD=0.", "An optimal mix-match control strategy for EUV and 193i scanners is crucial for the insertion of EUV lithography at 7nm technology node. The systematic differences between these exposure systems introduce additional cross-platform mixmatch overlay errors. In this paper, we quantify the EUV specific contributions to mix-match overlay, and explore the effectiveness of higher-order interfield and intrafield corrections on minimizing the on-product mix-match overlay errors. We also analyze the impact of intra-field sampling plans in terms of model accuracy and adequacy in capturing EUV specific intra-field signatures. Our analysis suggests that more intra-field measurements and appropriate placement of the metrology targets within the field are required to achieve the on-product overlay control goals for N7 HVM.", "While EUV systems equipped with a 0.33 Numerical Aperture lenses are readying to start volume manufacturing, ASML and Zeiss are ramping up their development activities on a EUV exposure tool with Numerical Aperture greater than 0.5. The purpose of this scanner, targeting a resolution of 8nm, is to extend Moore\u2019s law throughout the next decade.\nA novel, anamorphic lens design, has been developed to provide the required Numerical Aperture; this lens will be paired with new, faster stages and more accurate sensors enabling Moore\u2019s law economical requirements, as well as the tight focus and overlay control needed for future process nodes.\nThe tighter focus and overlay control budgets, as well as the anamorphic optics, will drive innovations in the imaging and OPC modelling, and possibly in the metrology concepts.\nFurthermore, advances in resist and mask technology will be required to image lithography features with less than 10nm resolution.\nThis paper presents an overview of the key technology innovations and infrastructure requirements for the next generation EUV systems.", "The imec N7 (iN7) platform has been developed to evaluate EUV patterning of advanced logic BEOL layers. Its design is based on a 42 nm first-level metal (M1) pitch, and a 32 nm pitch for the subsequent M2 layer. With these pitches, the iN7 node is an \u2018aggressive\u2019 full-scaled N7, corresponding to IDM N7, or foundry N5.\nEven in a 1D design style, single exposure of the 16 nm half-pitch M2 layer is very challenging for EUV lithography, because of its tight tip-to-tip configurations. Therefore, the industry is considering the hybrid use of ArFi-based SAQP combined with EUV Block as an alternative to EUV single exposure. As a consequence, the EUV Block layer may be one of the first layers to adopt EUV lithography in HVM.\nIn this paper, we report on the imec iN7 SAQP + Block litho performance and process integration, targeting the M2 patterning for a 7.5 track logic design. The Block layer is exposed on an ASML NXE:3300 EUV-scanner at imec, using optimized illumination conditions and state-of-the-art metal-containing negative tone resist (Inpria). Subsequently, the SAQP and block structures are characterized in a morphological study, assessing pattern fidelity and CD/EPE variability. The work is an experimental feasibility study of EUV insertion, for SAQP + Block M2 patterning on an industry-relevant N5 use-case.", "In 5nm node, even minor process variation in extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) can bring significant impact to the device performance. Except for the overlay and critical dimension uniformity (CDU), EUV specific effects, such as shadowing, three-dimensional mask effect (M3D), and stochastic effects, must also be understood in processing, modeling, and optical proximity correction (OPC). We simulate those variabilities using a calibrated model and compare it to what is observed on the wafer. The interconnect path of Metal1-Via1-Metal2 is studied by using a silicon-calibrated resistivity model to analyze the related overlap area and the electrical resistance. The approach allows us to quantify the impact of EUVL process by investigating the individual contribution of each patterning process variations.", "The EUV mask infrastructure is of key importance for the successful introduction of EUV lithography into volume production. In particular, for the production of defect free masks an actinic review of potential defect sites is required. ZEISS and the SUNY POLY SEMATECH EUVL Mask Infrastructure consortium have developed such an EUV aerial image metrology system, the AIMS\u2122 EUV, with the prototype tool regularly being used for customer measurement campaigns and the first system shipped to customer end of last year. In this paper, we provide an update on the system performance and present quantitative measurements of the impact of mask surface roughness on the aerial image. We show that an increasing amount of effects is only visible in actinic aerial imaging and discuss potential benefits of aerial image based mask qualification.", "We report on the printability, mitigation and actinic mask level review of programmed substrate blank pit and bump defects in a EUV lithography test mask. We show the wafer printing behavior of these defects exposed with an NXE:3300 EUV lithography scanner and the corresponding mask level actinic review using the AIMSTM tool. We will show which categories of these blank substrate defects print on wafer and how they can be mitigated by hiding these defects under absorber lines. Furthermore we show that actinic AIMSTM mask review images of these defects, in combination with a simple thresholded resist transfer model, can accurately predict their wafer printing profiles. We also compare mask level actinic AIMSTM to top down mask SEM review in their ability to detect these defects.", "A protective membrane \u2013 a pellicle \u2013 must be used to prevent yield loss during EUV lithography exposure, just as it was for 193nm lithography. The pellicle must be thin enough to transmit EUV light, yet strong enough to withstand the scanner environment. Membrane solutions for ~ 80W exposure exist. Our focus is developing a membrane solution for 250W exposure power. The main pellicle challenge here is still the identification of a membrane material that has very high transmission at EUV wavelengths. Additionally, absorption during lithographic exposure results in high thermal and mechanical load for the pellicle, which can cause yield problems. The current candidates for pellicle membranes such as poly-silicon and silicon nitride cannot withstand 250W power conditions, therefore alternative materials will be required for the future HVM pellicle.\nAt imec, a variety of novel membrane material options are investigated for the HVM pellicle application. One promising approach is based on carbon nanotubes (CNT). In this paper we outline different CNT based process options, and report results on their optical, thermal, and mechanical performance. In addition, we will report on their uniformity and robustness towards scanner application. Finally, the family of CNT-based membrane options will be compared to promising candidates fabricated using conventional film approaches that do not have a CNT layer.", "In this paper, we discuss the impact of various tool design perspectives on defect detection sensitivity for dark-field based EUV actinic blank inspection. We consider the impact from optical resolution (pixel size), EUV source type, and photon collection efficiency on critical defect SNR performance. The results show that as the pixel size approaches the target defect image size, defect SNR increases, and that pixel size also determines the dominant noise source in the inspection system. Moreover, the choice of the EUV source affects the optimal NA and illumination settings. For plasma-discharged sources, more photons provided by larger partial coherent illumination can improve the defect SNR, while coherent illumination is needed to get a higher defect SNR for synchrotron-based source. In the end, we show that simply increasing the photon collection efficiency by using high NA optics or increasing the source power cannot always improve the defect SNR. In a speckle noise dominated situation, larger outer NA includes more noise than defect signal, thus results in a lower SNR. The impact of source power also saturates at certain level as the system becomes speckle noise limited compared to photon noise limited.", "In this paper we compare two non-interferometric wavefront sensors suitable for in-situ high-NA EUV optical testing. The first is the AIS sensor, which has been deployed in both inspection and exposure tools. AIS is a compact, optical test that directly measures a wavefront by probing various parts of the imaging optic pupil and measuring localized wavefront curvature. The second is an image-based technique that uses an iterative algorithm based on simulated annealing to reconstruct a wavefront based on matching aerial images through focus. In this technique, customized illumination is used to probe the pupil at specific points to optimize differences in aberration signatures.", "As the industry continues to progress along the ITRS roadmap, not only the device dimensions shrink, but the architectures also increase in 3D complexity. Therefore, new metrology approaches for small structures are required. Small angle X-ray scattering has the potential for fast in line metrology but suffers from the large spot size needed in grazing incidence reflection and the low signal for the transmission geometry. Turning the incidence angle closer to normal and tuning the wavelengths into the EUV spectral range allows to decrease the spot size while keeping the signal high. We present an exploration of soft X-ray and EUV-scatterometry from grazing to near normal incidence, including a new approach in the design of metrology targets to avoid the footprint problem in grazing incidence geometry. Measurements were performed on e-beam written silicon gratings. The reconstructed geometrical line shape models are statistically validated by applying a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling technique. Experimental data and simulation results provide a first insight into the potential of EUV Scatterometry.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography with 13.5 nm wavelength is the main option for sub-10nm patterning in the semiconductor industry. We report improvements in resist performance towards EUV high volume manufacturing. A local CD uniformity (LCDU) model is introduced and validated with experimental contact hole (CH) data. Resist performance is analyzed in terms of ultimate printing resolution (R), line width roughness (LWR), sensitivity (S), exposure latitude (EL) and depth of focus (DOF). Resist performance of dense lines at 13 nm half-pitch and beyond is shown by chemical amplified resist (CAR) and non-CAR (Inpria YA Series) on NXE scanner. Resolution down to 10nm half pitch (hp) is shown by Inpria YA Series resist exposed on interference lithography at the Paul Sherrer Institute. Contact holes contrast and consequent LCDU improvement is achieved on a NXE:3400 scanner by decreasing the pupil fill ratio. State-of-the-art imaging meets 5nm node requirements for CHs. A dynamic gas lock (DGL) membrane is introduced between projection optics box (POB) and wafer stage. The DGL membrane will suppress the negative impact of resist outgassing on the projection optics by 100%, enabling a wider range of resist materials to be used. The validated LCDU model indicates that the imaging requirements of the 3nm node can be met with single exposure using a high-NA EUV scanner. The current status, trends, and potential roadblocks for EUV resists are discussed. Our results mark the progress and the improvement points in EUV resist materials to support EUV ecosystem.", "Imec is currently driving the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photo material development within the imec material and equipment supplier hub. EUV baseline processes using the ASML NXE3300 full field scanner have been setup for the critical layers of the imec N7 (iN7) BEOL process modules with a resist sensitivity of 35mJ/cm2, 40mJ/cm2 and 60mJ/cm2 for metal, block and vias layer, respectively. A feasibility study on higher sensitivity resists for HVM has been recently conducted looking at 16nm dense line-space at a targeted exposure dose of 20mJ/cm2. Such a study reveals that photoresist formulations with a cost-effective resist sensitivity are feasible today. Moreover, recent advances in enhanced underlayers are further offering novel development opportunities to increase the resist sensitivity. However, line width roughness (LWR) and pattern defectivity at nano scale are the major limiting factors of the lithographic process window and further efforts are needed to reach a HVM maturity level. We will present the results of the photo material screening and we examine in detail the lithography patterning results for the best performing photoresists. We further discuss the fundamental aspects of photo materials from a light-matter interaction standpoint looking at the photo emission yield at the EUV light for different photo materials towards a better understanding of the relation between photon efficiency and patterning performance. Finally, as metal containing resists are becoming part of the EUV material landscape, we also review the manufacturing aspects of a such class of resists looking at metal cross contamination pattern and defectivity on the process equipment.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL, \u03bb = 13.5 nm) being the most likely candidate to manufacture electronic devices for future technology nodes is to be introduced in high volume manufacturing (HVM) at the 7 nm logic node, at least at critical lithography levels. With this impending introduction, it is clear that excellent resist performance at ultra-high printing resolutions (below 20 nm line/space L/S) is ever more pressing. Nonetheless, EUVL has faced many technical challenges towards this paradigm shift to a new lithography wavelength platform. Since the inception of chemically amplified resists (CARs) they have been the base upon which state-of-the art photoresist technology has been developed from. Resist performance as measured in terms of printing resolution (R), line edge roughness (LER), sensitivity (D or exposure dose) and exposure latitude (EL) needs to be improved but there are well known trade-off relationships (LRS trade-off) among these parameters for CARs that hamper their simultaneous enhancement. Here, we present some of the most promising EUVL materials tested by EUV interference lithography (EUV-IL) with the aim of resolving features down to 11 nm half-pitch (HP), while focusing on resist performance at 16 and 13 nm HP as needed for the 7 and 5 nm node, respectively. EUV-IL has enabled the characterization and development of new resist materials before commercial EUV exposure tools become available and is therefore a powerful research and development tool. With EUV-IL, highresolution periodic images can be printed by the interference of two or more spatially coherent beams through a transmission-diffraction grating mask. For this reason, our experiments have been performed by EUV-IL at Swiss Light Source (SLS) synchrotron facility located at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). Having the opportunity to test hundreds of EUVL materials from vendors and research partners from all over the world, PSI is able to give a global update on some of the most promising materials tested.", "There are many knobs available that change the chemical and physical properties of the photoresists to \"break\" the RLS (Resolution, Sensitivity, Line edge/width roughness) trade-off, however those are not enough today to realize a material to satisfy all requirements at once for 7nm technology and beyond. DDRP improves the ultimate achievable resolution via pattern collapse mitigation, hence the priority of requirements for the EUV photoresist development may be changed with more focus on Sensitivity and LWR. This may potentially provide a new conceptual approach towards EUV PR development for DDRP applications. We have previously demonstrated pattern collapse (PC) mitigation via DDRP on different EUVL photoresists (including different resist platforms), achieving ultimate resolution and exposure latitude improvements [1,2]. In this contribution, we report patterning and material defect performance of HVM compatible (all aqueous) dry development rinse material. We will also report on process window improvement on 2-dimensional metal structures towards standard cell size reduction with elimination of mask layer(s) using single EUV exposure.", "Irresistible Materials is developing a new molecular resist system that demonstrates high-resolution capability based on the multi-trigger concept. A series of studies such as resist purification, developer choice,and enhanced resist crosslinking were conducted in order to optimize the performance of this material. The optimized conditions allowed patterning 14 nm half-pitch (hp) lines with a line width roughness (LWR) of 2.7 nm at the XIL beamline of the Swiss Light source. Furthermore it was possible to pattern 14 nm hp features with dose of 14 mJ/cm2 with an LWR of 4.9 nm. We have also begun to investigate the addition of high-Z additives to EUV photoresist as a means to increase sensitivity and modify secondary electron blur.", "In extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, 92 eV photons are used to expose photoresists. Current EUV photoresists are composed of photoacid generators (PAGs) in polymer matrices. Secondary electrons (2 - 80 eV) created in resists during EUV exposure play large role in acid-production. There are several proposed mechanisms for electron-resist interactions: internal excitation, electron trapping, and hole-initiated chemistry.\nHere, we will address two central questions in EUV resist research: (1) How many electrons are generated per EUV photon absorption? (2) By which mechanisms do these electrons interact and react with molecules in the resist? We will use this framework to evaluate the contributions of electron trapping and hole initiated chemistry to acid production in chemically amplified photoresists, with specific emphasis on the interdependence of these mechanisms. We will show measurements of acid yield from direct bulk electrolysis of PAGs and EUV exposures of PAGs in phenolic and nonphenolic polymers to narrow down the mechanistic possibilities in chemically amplified resists.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has been recognized as a promising candidate for the manufacturing of semiconductor devices as LS and CH pattern for 7nm node and beyond. EUV lithography is ready for high volume manufacturing stage. For the high volume manufacturing of semiconductor devices, significant improvement of sensitivity and line edge roughness (LWR) and Local CD Uniformity (LCDU) is required for EUV resist. It is well-known that the key challenge for EUV resist is the simultaneous requirement of ultrahigh resolution (R), low line edge roughness (L) and high sensitivity (S). Especially high sensitivity and good roughness is important for EUV lithography high volume manufacturing.\nWe are trying to improve sensitivity and LWR/LCDU from many directions. From material side, we found that both sensitivity and LWR/LCDU are simultaneously improved by controlling acid diffusion length and efficiency of acid generation using novel resin and PAG. And optimizing EUV integration is one of the good solution to improve sensitivity and LWR/LCDU. We are challenging to develop new multi-layer materials to improve sensitivity and LWR/LCDU. Our new multi-layer materials are designed for best performance in EUV lithography system. From process side, we found that sensitivity was substantially improved maintaining LWR applying novel type of chemical amplified resist (CAR) and process. EUV lithography evaluation results obtained for new CAR EUV interference lithography. And also metal containing resist is one possibility to break through sensitivity and LWR trade off. In this paper, we will report the recent progress of sensitivity and LWR/LCDU improvement of JSR novel EUV resist and process.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology is one of the leading candidates for enabling the next generation devices, for 7nm node and beyond. As the technology matures, further improvement is required in the area of blanket film defectivity, pattern defectivity, CD uniformity, and LWR/LER. As EUV pitch scaling approaches sub 20 nm, new techniques and methods must be developed to reduce the overall defectivity, mitigate pattern collapse and eliminate film related defect. IBM Corporation and Tokyo Electron Limited (TELTM) are continuously collaborating to develop manufacturing quality processes for EUVL.\nIn this paper, we review key defectivity learning required to enable 7nm node and beyond technology. We will describe ongoing progress in addressing these challenges through track-based processes (coating, developer, baking), highlighting the limitations of common defect detection strategies and outlining methodologies necessary for accurate characterization and mitigation of blanket defectivity in EUV patterning stacks. We will further discuss defects related to pattern collapse and thinning of underlayer films.", "As lithography tools continue their progress in both NA and wavelength in pursuit of Moore\u2019s law, we have reached the point where the number of features printed in a single pass can now easily surpass 1 trillion. Statistically, then, one should not be surprised to see some members of such a population exhibit fluctuations as great as 7\u03c3. But what do these fluctuations look like? We consider the problem in terms of variations in the effective local resist sensitivity caused by feature-to-feature differences in absorbed photons and resist component counts. We model such variations as a normal distribution, rather than the CDs themselves. As the CD vs. Dose curve is generally nonlinear over large ranges, the normal distribution of the local effective sensitivity then maps to a non-normal distribution in CD. For the case of individual vias printed near the resolution limit, this results in many more such undersized or completely closed vias than one would expect from a normal distribution of the CDs. We show examples of this behavior from both EUV exposures in the fab, and ebeam exposures in the lab. For the latter, results from a simple resist with a somewhat low quencher loading produce approximately the CD variation one would expect by modeling the quencher as distributed normally in the resist.", "Over the recent years EUV lithography has demonstrated the patterning of ever shrinking feature sizes (enabling the N7 technology node and below), while the EUV mask has remained unaltered using a 70nm Ta-based absorber. This has led to experimentally observed Mask 3D (M3D) effects at wafer level, which are induced by the interaction between the oblique incident EUV light and the patterned absorber with typical thickness values in the order of several wavelengths. In this paper we exploit the optical properties of the absorber material of the EUV mask as M3D mitigation strategy.\nUsing rigorous lithographic simulations, we screen potential single element absorber materials for their optical properties and their optimal thickness for minimum best focus variation through pitch at wafer level. In addition, the M3D mitigation by absorber material is evaluated by process window comparison of foundry N5 specific logic clips.\nIn order to validate the rigorous simulation predictions and to test the processing feasibility of the alternative absorber materials, we have selected the candidate single elements Nickel and Cobalt for an experimental evaluation on wafer substrates. In this work, we present the film characterization as well as first patterning tests of these single element candidate absorber materials.", "We report a study into intensity-driven mask 3D effects for N7 dark field two-bars in EUVL. For these features, traditional pupil optimization \"rules\" are advising to center a symmetric leaf shape illumination at the pupil plane location \u03c3Y = (-0.64, 0.64). Experimentally determined critical dimension Bossungs for this exposure condition however yield an extreme best focus separation due to an additional Bossung tilt appearing at defocus values beyond 20 nm for the bottom trench. The Bossung tilts are caused by a strong coupling between the primary image of the two-bar and its first local pitch-induced self-image. The coupling to the self-image can be suppressed and, hence, the overlapping process window can be enhanced by the application of asymmetric sources, or by using standard dipole 90Y or leaf shape illuminations in combination with optimally placed sub-resolution assist features.", "In order to succeed with such low-k1 lithography at EUV wavelength, we need to be able to print a grating at high contrast similar to ArF immersion tools, where a contrast exceeding 0.95 is achieved routinely. All 2d printing is composed of interference of x and y-directed diffraction orders and high contrast in 2d thus depends on such 1d grating contrast. Any low-k1 imaging will use either dipole or some other sort of extreme off-axis illumination such as cross-quad (cQuad). The two relevant magnitudes for any high contrast are the intrinsic contrast due to a monopole, and the spatial shift of the two images that are generated by the two monopoles making up the dipole exposure. In EUV with current absorbers, high contrast can currently only be achieved using monopole illumination, a technique that does not lend itself to process integration due to removal of wafer side telecentricity and resulting overlay problems at all but preferred pitch. For dipole illumination at low-k1 pitches, we collect only 0th order light and only one 1st diffracted order for each pole. This means that for a dipole at the resolution limit, the final image for horizontal l/s patterns consists of only four incident waves, one TE and one TM wave for each of the poles.\nIn this paper, we screen absorber by n and k values. In the process, we introduce phasor notation in order to gain insight into the behavior of the absorber and try to understand the metrics. We investigate intrinsic contrast and image blur due to monopole image shift.", "Vote-taking lithography sums up N mask images, each at 1/N dose, to mitigate the mask defects on each individual mask. The fundamental assumption is that the mask defects do not correlate in position from mask to mask, and so each individual defect will be blended with good images from the other N-1 masks. This paper will explore vote-taking for EUV lithography with both simulation and experimental results. PROLITH simulations will show the size of defects that can be healed for different N, the number of masks. SEM images of NXE 3300 exposures will be shown that are similar to those predicted from simulation. The implementation of vote-taking lithography for High Volume Manufacturing has huge practical and economic barriers. Some expose tool capabilities that could enable vote-taking lithography will be discussed. Besides defect mitigation, we briefly speculate on other possible imaging benefits opened up by voting with several exposure passes.", "The imec N7 (iN7) platform has been developed to evaluate EUV patterning of advanced logic BEOL layers. Its design is based on a 42 nm first-level metal (M1) pitch, and a 32 nm pitch for the subsequent metal layers1. With these pitches, the iN7 node is an \u2018aggressive\u2019 full-scaled N7, corresponding to IDM N7, or foundry N5.\nRegarding the metal 2 layer, imec is evaluating two integration approaches: EUV single print and SAQP+EUV Block. Extensive work is reported on both approaches2,3. The work detailed in this paper will deal about the computational work done prior to tape-out for the EUV direct print option.\nWe will discuss the EUV source mask optimization for an ASML NXE:3300 EUV scanner. Afterwards we will shortly touch upon OPC compact modeling and more extensively on OPC itself. Based on the current design rules and MRC, printability checks indicate that only limited process windows are obtained. We propose ways to improve the printability through MRC and design. Applying those changes can potentially lead to a sufficient process window.", "Multi-patterning has been adopted widely in high volume manufacturing as 193 immersion extension, and it becomes realistic solution of nano-order scaling. In fact, it must be key technology on single directional (1D) layout design [1] for logic devise and it becomes a major option for further scaling technique in SAQP. The requirement for patterning fidelity control is getting savior more and more, stochastic fluctuation as well as LER (Line edge roughness) has to be micro-scopic observation aria.\nIn our previous work, such atomic order controllability was viable in complemented technique with etching and deposition [2]. Overlay issue form major potion in yield management, therefore, entire solution is needed keenly including alignment accuracy on scanner and detectability on overlay measurement instruments. As EPE (Edge placement error) was defined as the gap between design pattern and contouring of actual pattern edge, pattern registration in single process level must be considerable. The complementary patterning to fabricate 1D layout actually mitigates any process restrictions, however, multiple process step, symbolized as LELE with 193-i, is burden to yield management and affordability. Recent progress of EUV technology is remarkable, and it is major potential solution for such complicated technical issues. EUV has robust resolution limit and it must be definitely strong scaling driver for process simplification. On the other hand, its stochastic variation such like shot noise due to light source power must be resolved with any additional complemented technique.\nIn this work, we examined the nano-order CD and profile control on EUV resist pattern and would introduce excellent accomplishments.", "As EUV lithography marches closer to reality for high volume production, its peculiar modeling challenges related to both inter- and intra- field effects has necessitated building OPC infrastructure that operates with field position dependency. Previous state of the art approaches to modeling field dependency used piecewise constant models where static input models are assigned to specific x/y-positions within the field. OPC and simulation could assign the proper static model based on simulation-level placement. However, in the realm of 7nm and 5nm feature sizes, small discontinuities in OPC from piecewise constant model changes can cause unacceptable levels of EPE errors. The introduction of Dynamic Model Generation (DMG) can be shown to effectively avoid these dislocations by providing unique mask and optical models per simulation region, allowing a near continuum of models through field. DMG allows unique models for EMF, apodization, aberrations, etc to vary through the entire field and provides a capability to precisely and accurately model systematic field signatures.", "Contact-hole layer patterning is expected to be one of the first applications for EUV lithography. Conventional absorber masks, however, are extremely inefficient for these layers, placing even more burden on the already challenging source power demands. To address this concern, a chromeless checker-board phase-shift mask for 25- nm dense contacts has been shown to provide a throughput gain of 8x based on characterization with the SHARP EUV microscope and 7x based on micro field patterning with the Berkeley MET. These promising experimental results warrant both assessment for implementation in practice and rigorous simulations for diagnosing 3D mask effects. In this paper we verify the theoretical benefits of phase-shift masks over traditional absorber masks in idealized Kirchhoff analysis, explore the sensitivity of patterning to deviations from the ideal scattered orders, model the etched multilayer using thin-film characteristic matrix analysis, and finally use rigorous 3D Finite-Time Time Domain (FTTD) simulations of etched multilayer masks to explore mitigation of 3D effects to achieve optimal mask designs for minimum-pitch line-space and contact array patterns.", "This paper summarizes findings on the iN7 platform (foundry N5 equivalent) for single exposure EUV (SE EUV) of M1 and M2 BEOL layers. Logic structures within these layers have been measured after litho and after etch, and variability was characterized both with conventional CD-SEM measurements as well as Hitachi contouring method. After analyzing the patterning of these layers, the impact of variability on potential interconnect reliability was studied by using MonteCarlo and process emulation simulations to determine if current litho/etch performance would meet success criteria for the given platform design rules.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is crucial to enabling technology scaling in pitch and critical dimension (CD). Currently, one of the key challenges of introducing EUV lithography to high volume manufacturing (HVM) is throughput, which requires high source power and high sensitivity chemically amplified photoresists. Important limiters of high sensitivity chemically amplified resists (CAR) are the effects of photon shot noise and resist blur on the number of photons received and of photoacids generated per feature, especially at the pitches required for 7 nm and 5 nm advanced technology nodes. These stochastic effects are reflected in via structures as hole-to-hole CD variation or local CD uniformity (LCDU). Here, we demonstrate a synergy of film stack deposition, EUV lithography, and plasma etch techniques to improve LCDU, which allows the use of high sensitivity resists required for the introduction of EUV HVM. Thus, to improve LCDU to a level required by 5 nm node and beyond, film stack deposition, EUV lithography, and plasma etch processes were combined and co-optimized to enhance LCDU reduction from synergies.\nTest wafers were created by depositing a pattern transfer stack on a substrate representative of a 5 nm node target layer. The pattern transfer stack consisted of an atomically smooth adhesion layer and two hardmasks and was deposited using the Lam VECTOR PECVD product family. These layers were designed to mitigate hole roughness, absorb out-of-band radiation, and provide additional outlets for etch to improve LCDU and control hole CD. These wafers were then exposed through an ASML NXE3350B EUV scanner using a variety of advanced positive tone EUV CAR. They were finally etched to the target substrate using Lam Flex dielectric etch and Kiyo conductor etch systems. Metrology methodologies to assess dimensional metrics as well as chip performance and defectivity were investigated to enable repeatable patterning process development.\nIllumination conditions in EUV lithography were optimized to improve normalized image log slope (NILS), which is expected to reduce shot noise related effects. It can be seen that the EUV imaging contrast improvement can further reduce post-develop LCDU from 4.1 nm to 3.9 nm and from 2.8 nm to 2.6 nm. In parallel, etch processes were developed to further reduce LCDU, to control CD, and to transfer these improvements into the final target substrate. We also demonstrate that increasing post-develop CD through dose adjustment can enhance the LCDU reduction from etch. Similar trends were also observed in different pitches down to 40 nm. The solutions demonstrated here are critical to the introduction of EUV lithography in high volume manufacturing. It can be seen that through a synergistic deposition, lithography, and etch optimization, LCDU at a 40 nm pitch can be improved to 1.6 nm (3-sigma) in a target oxide layer and to 1.4 nm (3-sigma) at the photoresist layer.", "Pattern transfer fidelity is always a major challenge for any lithography process and needs continuous improvement. Lithographic processes in semiconductor industry are primarily driven by optical imaging on photosensitive polymeric material (resists). Quality of pattern transfer can be assessed by quantifying multiple parameters such as, feature size uniformity (CD), placement, roughness, sidewall angles etc. Roughness in features primarily corresponds to variation of line edge or line width and has gained considerable significance, particularly due to shrinking feature sizes and variations of features in the same order. This has caused downstream processes (Etch (RIE), Chemical Mechanical Polish (CMP) etc.) to reconsider respective tolerance levels. A very important aspect of this work is relevance of roughness metrology from pattern formation at resist to subsequent processes, particularly electrical validity. A major drawback of current LER/LWR metric (sigma) is its lack of relevance across multiple downstream processes which effects material selection at various unit processes. In this work we present a comprehensive assessment of Line Edge and Line Width Roughness at multiple lithographic transfer processes. To simulate effect of roughness a pattern was designed with periodic jogs on the edges of lines with varying amplitudes and frequencies. There are numerous methodologies proposed to analyze roughness and in this work we apply them to programmed roughness structures to assess each technique\u2019s sensitivity. This work also aims to identify a relevant methodology to quantify roughness with relevance across downstream processes.", "As we presented in the last conference, it is much difficult to get down the k1 limit of EUV lithography compared to that of optical lithography especially recent immersion lithography. Even though current 0.33NA NXE3300 tool has enhanced aberration characteristics and variable illumination mode than its predecessor, ADT and NXE3100, still there are limitations related with resolution capability of EUV lithography. First of all, photon shot noise and immature resist performances play an important role in patterning of very fine patterns. As already known, low sensitivity resists have been widely used to reduce shot noise. However, when considering productivity in EUV lithography, high sensitivity resists are inevitable, so it is necessary to increase image contrast by reducing scanner blur like aberration, M3D, stray light et al. We have investigated the impact of aberration and limitation in illumination pupil fill ratio in EUV. In particular, the aberration sensitivity is different by the illumination conditions, this was intensified when using the particular pupil. Because the lens calibration is conducted with standard illumination condition in NXE3300, it is necessary to consider different aberration sensitivity in accordance with pattern and used pupil condition in EUV lithography. To ensure the process margin of tech node close to limit, a flexpupil with low pupil fill ratio (PFR) than 0.2 were required. Hence in order to avoid through-put loss at this condition, the new concept of the illuminator design is required without light loss. Contamination of collector mirror can affect the patterning also. We will also report about the patterning effect of pupil deformation by degraded collector in low PFR condition.", "EUV lithography is viewed as a highly desirable technology for 5nm and 7nm node patterning cost reduction and process simplicity. However, for the 5nm and 7nm nodes EUV not only needs to function in a low-K1 resolution environment but has several new and complex patterning issues which will need accurate compensation by mask synthesis tools and flows. The main new issues are: long-range flare variation across the chip, feature dependent focus offsets due to high mask topography, asymmetry inducing shadowing effects which vary across the lens slit, significantly higher lens aberrations, illumination source changes (across the lens and with time) and new resist exposure mechanisms. These solutions must be successfully deployed at low K1 values and must be integrated together to create OPC/RET flows which have high resolution, high accuracy, and are fast to deploy. Therefore, the combined requirements of low-K1 resolution, full reticle correction accuracy and process window can be even more challenging than in current optical lithography mask synthesis flows.\nAdvanced computational methods such as ILT and model-based SRAF optimization are well known to have considerable benefits in process window and resolution for low-K1 193 lithography. However, these methods have not been well studied to understand their benefits for lower-K1 EUV lithography where fabs must push EUV resolution, 2D accuracy and process window to their limits. In this paper, we investigate where inverse lithography methods can improve EUV patterning weaknesses vs. traditional OPC/RET. We first show how ILT can be used to guide a better understanding of optimal solutions for EUV mask synthesis. We then provide detailed comparisons of ILT and traditional methods on a wide range of mask synthesis applications.", "Initial readiness of EUV patterning has been demonstrated at the 7-nm device node with the focus now shifting to driving the 'effective' k1 factor and enabling the second generation of EUV patterning. In current EUV lithography, photoresist thicknesses <30 nm are required to meet resolution targets and mitigate pattern collapse. Etch budgets necessitate the reduction of underlayer thickness as well. Typical spin-on underlayers show high defectivity when reducing thickness to match thinner resist. Inorganic deposited underlayers are lower in defectivity and can potentially enable ultrathin EUV patterning stacks. However, poor resist-inorganic underlayer adhesion severely limits their use. Existing adhesion promotion techniques are found to be either ineffective or negatively affect the etch budget. Here, using a grafted polymer brush adhesion layer we demonstrate an ultrathin EUV patterning stack comprised of inorganic underlayer, polymer brush and resist. We show printing of sub-36 nm pitch features with good lithography process window and low defectivity on various inorganic substrates, with significant improvement over existing adhesion promotion techniques. We systematically study the effect of brush composition, molecular weight and deposition time/temperature to optimize grafting and adhesion. We also show process feasibility and extendibility through pattern transfer from the resist into typical back end stacks.", "Inpria has developed a directly patternable metal oxide hard-mask as a high-resolution photoresist for EUV lithography1. In this contribution, we describe a Tachyon 2D OPC full-chip model for an Inpria resist as applied to an N7 BEOL block mask application.", "Wafer overlay errors due to EUV mask non-flatness and thickness variations need to be minimized for the successful deployment of EUV lithography at N7 HVM. In this paper, we provide an updated assessment of the overlay impacts from EUV mask blanks as relevant to N7. We then evaluate the effectiveness of high-order scanner correction and mask compensation in minimizing the mask blank induced overlay to meet the allocated N7 overlay budget. Various scenarios for combining the compensation methods are evaluated, and a practical EUV mask flatness and thickness variation specification for N7 production is proposed.", "Initial readiness of EUV (extreme ultraviolet) patterning was demonstrated in 2016 with IBM Alliance's 7nm device technology. The focus has now shifted to driving the 'effective' k1 factor and enabling the second generation of EUV patterning. With the substantial cost of EUV exposure there is significant interest in extending the capability to do single exposure patterning with EUV. To enable this, emphasis must be placed on the aspect ratios, adhesion, defectivity reduction, etch selectivity, and imaging control of the whole patterning process. Innovations in resist materials and processes must be included to realize the full entitlement of EUV lithography at 0.33NA. In addition, enhancements in the patterning process to enable good defectivity, lithographic process window, and post etch pattern fidelity are also required. Through this work, the fundamental material challenges in driving down the effective k1 factor will be highlighted.", "EUV lithography has been desired as the leading technology for 1x or single nm half-pitch patterning. However, the source power, masks and resist materials still have critical issues for mass production. Especially in resist materials, RLS trade-off has been the key issue. To overcome this issue, we are suggesting Dry Development Rinse Process (DDRP) and Materials (DDRM) as the pattern collapse mitigation approach. This DDRM can perform not only as pattern collapse free materials for fine pitch, but also as the etching hard mask against bottom layer (spin on carbon : SOC). In this paper, we especially propose new approaches to achieve high resolution around hp1X nm L/S and single nm line patterning. Especially, semi iso 8nm line was successfully achieved with good LWR (2.5nm) and around 3 times aspect ratio. This single nm patterning technique also helped to enhance sensitivity about 33%. On the other hand, pillar patterning thorough CH pattern by applying DDRP also showed high resolution below 20nm pillar CD with good LCDU and high sensitivity. This new DDRP technology can be the promising approach not only for hp1Xnm level patterning but also single nm patterning in N7/N5 and beyond.", "In this paper, we provide an overview of various challenges and their solutions for scaling laser-produced-plasma (LPP) extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) source performance to enable high volume manufacturing. We will discuss improvements to source architecture that facilitated the increase of EUV power from 100W to >200W, and the technical challenges for power scaling of key source parameters and subsystems. Finally, we will describe current power-scaling research activities and provide a forward looking perspective for LPP EUV sources towards 500W.", "We have been developing CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source which is the most promising solution as the 13.5nm high power light source for HVM EUVL since 2003. Unique original technologies such as; combination of pulsed CO2 laser and Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser pulse shooting and mitigation with magnetic field have been developed in Gigaphoton Inc.. The theoretical and experimental data have clearly showed the advantage of our proposed strategy. We demonstrated 117W EUV power (I/F clean in burst), 50 kHz, 22 hours stable operation at Pilot #1 device. Target of this device is 250 W EUV power by 27 kW pulsed CO2 driver laser system.", "High-throughput actinic mask inspection tools are needed as EUVL begins to enter into volume production phase. One of the key technologies to realize such inspection tools is a high-radiance EUV source of which radiance is supposed to be as high as 100 W/mm2/sr. Ushio is developing laser-assisted discharge-produced plasma (LDP) sources. Ushio\u2019s LDP source is able to provide sufficient radiance as well as cleanliness, stability and reliability. Radiance behind the debris mitigation system was confirmed to be 120 W/mm2/sr at 9 kHz and peak radiance at the plasma was increased to over 200 W/mm2/sr in the recent development which supports high-throughput, high-precision mask inspection in the current and future technology nodes. One of the unique features of Ushio\u2019s LDP source is cleanliness. Cleanliness evaluation using both grazing-incidence Ru mirrors and normal-incidence Mo/Si mirrors showed no considerable damage to the mirrors other than smooth sputtering of the surface at the pace of a few nm per Gpulse. In order to prove the system reliability, several long-term tests were performed. Data recorded during the tests was analyzed to assess two-dimensional radiance stability. In addition, several operating parameters were monitored to figure out which contributes to the radiance stability. The latest model that features a large opening angle was recently developed so that the tool can utilize a large number of debris-free photons behind the debris shield. The model was designed both for beam line application and high-throughput mask inspection application. At the time of publication, the first product is supposed to be in use at the customer site.", "Laser-produced plasma (LPP) EUV sources have demonstrated approximately 125 W at customer sites, establishing confidence in EUV lithography as a viable manufacturing technology. However, beyond the 7 nm technology node existing scanner/source technology must enable higher-NA imaging systems (requiring increased resist dose and providing half-field exposures) and/or EUV multi-patterning (requiring increased wafer throughput proportional to the number of exposure passes. Both development paths will require a substantial increase in EUV source power to maintain the economic viability of the technology, creating an opportunity for free-electron laser (FEL) EUV sources. FEL-based EUV sources offer an economic, high-power/single-source alternative to LPP EUV sources. Should free-electron lasers become the preferred next generation EUV source, the choice of FEL emission architecture will greatly affect its operational stability and overall capability.\nA near-term industrialized FEL is expected to utilize one of the following three existing emission architectures: (1) selfamplified spontaneous emission (SASE), (2) regenerative amplification (RAFEL), or (3) self-seeding (SS-FEL). Model accelerator parameters are put forward to evaluate the impact of emission architecture on FEL output. Then, variations in the parameter space are applied to assess the potential impact to lithography operations, thereby establishing component sensitivity. The operating range of various accelerator components is discussed based on current accelerator performance demonstrated at various scientific user facilities. Finally, comparison of the performance between the model accelerator parameters and the variation in parameter space provides a means to evaluate the potential emission architectures. A scorecard is presented to facilitate this evaluation and provide a framework for future FEL design and enablement for EUV lithography applications.", "TNO is building EBL2 as a publicly accessible test facility for EUV lithography related development of photomasks, pellicles, optics, and other components requiring EUV exposure. EBL2 consists of a EUV Beam Line, a XPS system, and sample handling infrastructure. Recently we finished installation of the source, exposure chamber, handlers and XPS system. This paper describes the integration process and first light of the EUV source.EBL2 accepts a wide range of sample sizes, including EUV masks with or without pellicles. All types of samples will be loaded using a standard dual pod interface. EUV masks returned from EBL2 will retain their NXE compatibility to facilitate wafer printing on scanners after exposure in EBL2. The Beam Line provides high intensity EUV irradiation from a Sn-fueled EUV source from Ushio. EUV intensity, spectrum, and repetition rate are all adjustable. The XPS system is now operational and accepts samples up to reticle size.", "Actinic mask defect inspection is an essential process step for the implementation of EUV Lithography in high-volume manufacturing. The main challenges for any mask defect inspection platform are resolution, sensitivity, and throughput. The reflective-mode EUV mask scanning lensless imaging microscope (RESCAN) is being developed to provide actinic patterned mask inspection capabilities for defects and patterns with high resolution and high throughput, for node 7 and beyond. Namely, the first goal of the RESCAN project is to develop a tool capable of inspecting an EUV reticle in about 7 hours and detect mask defects down to a size of 10 nm. The lensless imaging concept allows to overcome the resolution limitations due to the numerical aperture (NA) and lens aberrations of conventional actinic mask imaging systems. With the increasing availability of computational power and the refinement of iterative phase reconstruction algorithms, lensless imaging became a powerful tool to synthesize the complex amplitude of the actinic aerial image providing us also with extremely valuable information about phase and mask 3D effects. Here, we present a brief description of the current prototype of the RESCAN platform and illustrate a few experimental examples of programmed defect detection.", "EUV lithography is one of the promising technologies for 1X nm patterning. EUV lithography has high resolution capability because of short wavelength of source but it has some particular patterning problems which are not appeared a t optical lithography. Owing to reflective optics, EUV light incidents obliquely in mask and oblique incidence of EUV lithography leads shadow effect and arc-shaped exposure slit. The study of these particular optical problems are required for optical proximity correction (OPC). Arc-shaped exposure slit leads azimuthal angle variation, incident angle variation , and variation of shadow width. With these variations along exposure slit, patterning result is varied along the exposure slit. With understanding of these particular optical problems, lots of EUV OPC studies have been presented with 0.33 conventional NA system. However, suggested anamorphic high NA system has not only elliptical shaped mask NA and also different angle distribution. The incident angle variation as a function of azimuthal angle is different between isomorphic and anamorphic NA systems. In case of anamorphic NA system, incident angle distribution is decreased on horizontal direction but it is larger on vertical direction compared with case of isomorphic NA system. These differences make different arc-shaped slit effect. CD variation as a function of azimuthal angle is different between isomorphic and a namorphic NA systems. The study of CD variation along the exposure slit is very helpful for OPC in EUV lithography.", "One of the major obstacles towards the implementation of extreme ultraviolet lithography for upcoming technology nodes in semiconductor industry remains the realization of a fast and reliable detection methods patterned mask defects. We are developing a reflective EUV mask-scanning lensless imaging tool (RESCAN), installed at the Swiss Light Source synchrotron at the Paul Scherrer Institut. Our system is based on a two-step defect inspection method. In the first step, a low-resolution defect map is generated by die to die comparison of the diffraction patterns from areas with programmed defects, to those from areas that are known to be defect-free on our test sample. In a later stage, a die to database comparison will be implemented in which the measured diffraction patterns will be compared to those calculated directly from the mask layout. This Scattering Scanning Contrast Microscopy technique operates purely in the Fourier domain without the need to obtain the aerial image and, given a sufficient signal to noise ratio, defects are found in a fast and reliable way, albeit with a location accuracy limited by the spot size of the incident illumination. Having thus identified rough locations for the defects, a fine scan is carried out in the vicinity of these locations. Since our source delivers coherent illumination, we can use an iterative phase-retrieval method to reconstruct the aerial image of the scanned area with \u2013 in principle \u2013 diffraction-limited resolution without the need of an objective lens. Here, we will focus on the aerial image reconstruction technique and give a few examples to illustrate the capability of the method.", "Unlike optical masks which are transmissive optical elements, use of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation requires a reflective mask structure - a multi-layer coating consisting of alternating layers of high-Z (wave impedance) and low-Z materials that provide enhanced reflectivity over a narrow wavelength band peaked at the Bragg wavelength.1 Absorber side wall angle, corner rounding,2 surface roughness,3 and defects4 affect mask performance, but even seemingly simple parameters like bulk reflectivity on mirror and absorber surfaces can have a profound influence on imaging. For instance, using inaccurate reflectivity values at small and large incident angles would diminish the benefits of source mask co-optimization (SMO) and result in larger than expected pattern shifts.\nThe goal of our work is to calculate the variation in mask reflectivity due to various sources of inaccuracies using Monte Carlo simulations. Such calculation is necessary as small changes in the thickness and optical properties of the high-Z and low-Z materials can cause substantial variations in reflectivity. This is further complicated by undesirable intermixing between the two materials used to create the reflector.5 One of the key contributors to mask reflectivity fluctuation is identified to be the intermixing layer thickness. We also investigate the impacts on OPC when the wrong mask information is provided, and evaluate the deterioration of overlapping process window. For a hypothetical N7 via layer, the lack of accurate mask information costs 25% of the depth of focus at 5% exposure latitude. Our work would allow the determination of major contributors to mask reflectivity variation, drive experimental efforts of measuring such contributors, provide strategies to optimize mask reflectivity, and quantize the OPC errors due to imperfect mask modeling.", "The prospect of EUVL (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) insertion into HVM (High Volume Manufacturing) has never been this promising. As technology is prepared for \"lab to fab\" transition, it becomes important to comprehend challenges associated with integrating EUVL infrastructure within existing high volume chip fabrication processes in a foundry fab. The existing 193nm optical lithography process flow for reticle handling and storage in a fab atmosphere is well established and in-fab reticle contamination concerns are mitigated with the reticle pellicle. However EUVL reticle pellicle is still under development and if available, may only provide protection against particles but not molecular contamination. HVM fab atmosphere is known to be contaminated with trace amounts of AMC\u2019s (Atmospheric Molecular Contamination). If such contaminants are organic in nature and get absorbed on the reticle surface, EUV photon cause photo-dissociation resulting into carbon generation which is known to reduce multilayer reflectivity and also degrades exposure uniformity. Chemical diffusion and aggregation of other ions is also reported under the e-beam exposure of a EUV reticle which is known to cause haze issues in optical lithography. Therefore it becomes paramount to mitigate absorbed molecular contaminant concerns on EUVL reticle surface. In this paper, we have studied types of molecular contaminants that are absorbed on an EUVL reticle surface under HVM fab storage and handling conditions. Effect of storage conditions (gas purged vs atmospheric) in different storage pods (Dual pods, Reticle Clamshells) is evaluated. Absorption analysis is done both on ruthenium capping layer as well as TaBN absorber. Ru surface chemistry change as a result of storage is also studied. The efficacy of different reticle cleaning processes to remove absorbed contaminant is evaluated as well.", "There has been reports of EUV scanner aberration effects to the patterns down to 18 nm half-pitch (hp). Maximum aberration of the latest EUV scanner is reported as 25 m\u03bb. We believe that the first EUV mass production will be applied to the devices of 16 nm hp, so that we checked the aberration effects on 16 nm periodic line and space patterns and nonperiodic double and five-bar patterns. Coma aberrations of Z7, Z8, Z14 and Z15 Zernike polynomials (ZP) seems to be the dominant ones that make pattern distortion. Non-negligible critical dimension (CD) variation and position shift are obtained with the reported maximum 25 m\u03bb of coma aberration. Optical proximity correction (OPC) is tried to see if this aberration effects can be minimized, so that we can make the desired patterns even though there is a non-correctable scanner aberration.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) pellicle is required for protecting the EUV mask from defects, contaminations, and particles during exposure process. EUV pellicle should be very thin for high transmission of EUV wavelength. Therefore, EUV pellicle can be easily deformed during the exposure process, and the multi-stack pellicle is suggested to minimize this deformation of EUV pellicle. The EUV multi-stack pellicle is made of polysilicon-based core layer and capping layers for the durability during the exposure process. Nevertheless, there remains other manufacturing, thermal, and mechanical problems. In this study, we investigated the impact of wrinkles of EUV pellicle, which can be formed during pellicle manufacturing or exposure process, in terms of transmission non-uniformity and critical dimension (CD) variation for 5- nm and 3-nm nodes. To fabricate 3-nm node, we need a high numerical aperture (NA) system such as an anamorphic NA system with chief ray angle of 6-degree. The wrinkle can be uniform in height and period, but we assumed a realistic non-uniform wrinkle. This non-uniform wrinkle of multi-stack pellicle may cause different image distortion for 5-nm and 3-nm nodes with the isomorphic and anamorphic NA systems. The transmission non-uniformity is calculated with various heights and periods of non-uniform wrinkles of the pellicle. It is found that the transmission non-uniformity for wrinkled pellicle for the anamorphic NA system can be larger than that for the isomorphic NA system to obtain CD uniformity below 0.2 nm.", "Next-generation EUV lithography systems will use anamorphic optics to achieve high-NA. The well-known Zernike circle polynomials do not describe the sixteen primary aberrations of these anamorphic optical systems though. We propose to use a basis which does describe the primary aberrations. We examine the properties of this new basis and how they impact lithographic processes through analogies to isomorphic aberrations. We have developed an application to use the proposed basis in existing lithography simulators. There is an additional importance in EUVL placed on understanding how pupil variation evolves during system operation. Interferometric methods are the de facto standard of pupil phase metrology but are challenging to implement during tool use. We have previously presented an approach to measure both the pupil amplitude and phase variation of isomorphic EUVL systems from images formed by that system. We show how this methodology can be adapted to anamorphic optical systems. More specifically, we will present a set of binary metrology targets sensitive to the anamorphic primary aberrations.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography is one of the promising high volume manufacturing processes for devices below 7 nm node and beyond. However, resist pattern collapse is one of the hurdles in achieving a comfortable process margin/window for resist patterning. To suppress this resist pattern collapse and to improve manufacturing process margin, undoubtedly it is a well-known fact that the rinse materials can mitigate a pattern collapse at development process.\nIn this study, we focus on the relationship between resist swelling and pattern collapse, based on the assumption of resist pattern softening induced by resist swelling and further resist pattern bending or deformation which could be classified as pattern collapse. To verify this model, two samples of Rinse-A and Rinse-B which showed similar capillary force but different resist swelling behavior expected, respectively, were prepared. And the hardness of the resist films treated using those rinse materials together with de-ionized water as reference rinse, were measured using nano-indentation measurement technique.\nFrom the result, it was found that Rinse-A had the resist film hardness reduced by 7.9 % as compared to that on de-ionized water. On the other hand, Rinse-B which was designed to suppress the penetration of additives into the resist film, exhibited comparable hardness property to that on reference rinse, de-ionized water. Finally, the evaluation of lithographic performance of the photoresist in different rinse process conditions using Rinse-A and Rinse-B was carried out, and Rinse- B achieved 12.7 nm minimum pattern size of resist feature at 16 nm half pitch printing by interference projection system on Extreme Ultraviolet lithography, whereas Rinse-A showed 16.5 nm.", "The shrink in feature sizes enabled by EUV lithography introduces a regime where stochastic limits to resolution can manifest in the form of line edge roughness (LER) for line/space patterns and local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) for contact/holes. To meet increasing tolerances on edge placement error (EPE) and suppression of stochastic effects, an understanding of EUV mask contributions on lithographic patterning variability is essential. The work here explores stochastic noise originating from the mask patterning process and attempts to quantify its contributions towards on-wafer LCDU. A semiempirical approach was used to statistically decompose the mask variability component from the measured LCDU and provide a first-order understanding of the mask\u2019s impact on wafer. Taking a more direct approach, a one-to-one correlation of local CD variation between mask and wafer was also experimentally shown, presenting the possibility for predicting the contributions and impact of mask LCDU on wafer prior to exposure.", "Currently, there are many developments in the field of EUV lithography that are helping to move it towards increased HVM feasibility. Targeted improvements in hardware design for advanced lithography are of interest to our group specifically for metrics such as CD uniformity, LWR, and defect density. Of course, our work is focused on EUV process steps that are specifically affected by litho track performance, and consequently, can be improved by litho track design improvement and optimization. In this study we are building on our experience to provide continual improvement for LWR, CDU, and Defects as applied to a standard EUV process by employing novel hardware solutions on our SOKUDO DUO coat develop track system. Although it is preferable to achieve such improvements post-etch process we feel, as many do, that improvements after patterning are a precursor to improvements after etching. We hereby present our work utilizing the SOKUDO DUO coat develop track system with an ASML NXE:3300 in the IMEC (Leuven, Belgium) cleanroom environment to improve aggressive dense L/S patterns.", "Mask 3D (M3D) effects remain a significant challenge affecting EUV lithography (EUVL) imaging performance due to the comparable sizes of the mask and the EUV wavelength. Pre-compensation with the insertion of sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) has been proposed as a solution to compensate M3D effects and improve the process window for advanced technology nodes. In this paper, we discuss the possible positive impact of SRAFs on Bossung tilt, and provide physical insight into the optical mechanisms at play enabling M3D effect mitigation. In particular, we consider an example isolated 2-bar (CD = 16 nm) pattern imaged under delta function dipole illumination. We compare the scattered order distribution and Bossung tilt with and without SRAFs. The results show that SRAFs actually introduce stronger effective single pole aberrations in the imaging process. However, the opposite impacts on Bossung tilt from each pole results in an overall improvement for dipole illumination. Reduced Bossung tilt and a 21% improvement of the overlapping process window are achieved by the insertion of asymmetric SRAFs into the 2-bar mask design.", "EUV lithography (EUVL) is rising up as a solution of sub-10nm technology node via patterning. Due to better resolution of EUVL than it of immersion ArF (iArF) lithography, multiple iArF masks can be replaced by one EUV mask. However, for 24nm by 24nm metal grid, two diagonally neighboring vias yield either contour of two holes or peanut-shape contour. Because of the large variability of the via contours, the two vias are separably patterned with two different masks. We propose to insert bridge patterns (BPs) at the middle of the diagonally neighboring vias, so that single EUV exposure can draw peanut-shape contour consistently. In this study, we also assume 2D self-aligned via (2D SAV) which can align via holes in both vertical and horizontal direction for better edge placement error margin, so unique re-targeted via patterns that is called bridged via (BV) appears. We investigate impact of BV size and BP shapes on simulated contour using source mask optimization, and popular BVs are compared in terms of probability of failure which are calculated with Monte-Carlo simulation.", "Studies have been carried out on developing a method for improving EUV resist sensitivity by enhancing EUV light absorption through the addition of metals having high EUV light absorption to the resist polymer in order to increase secondary electron emission, thereby enhancing PAG reactivity and improving acid generation efficiency[1-3]. To confirm whether the addition of metals having high EUV light absorption actually does enhance sensitivity, study efforts included transmittance measurements and sensitivity evaluations of resist samples doped with ZrO2 or TeO2 nanoparticles, which have low and high EUV light absorption, respectively, in molar quantities of 0-2 relative to PAG. The samples were subjected to EUV exposure at the NewSUBARU synchrotron radiation facility. While the ZrO2-doped resist showed no evident enhancement of sensitivity or transmittance, the TeO2-doped resist showed enhancement in both properties. Based on these results, we confirmed that the addition of metals having high EUV light absorption to the EUV resist enhances its EUV light absorption and increases secondary electron emission, thereby enhancing PAG reactivity and improving acid generation efficiency.", "The goal of this work intends to explore the effects of different acid concentrations on LCDU and to utilize these experimental data to validate the LCDU analytical model for CAR with the final aim to predict the chemical limits of CAR. In this work, effects of acid deprotection, acid diffusion, acid-base interaction and PEB temperature on LCDU are studied by varying the PAG acidity, size, loading and quencher loading in chemically amplified resist. It was found PAG acidity, PAG anion size, quencher loading and PEB have significant influences on LCDU, while PAG loading has less significant influences. The EUV experimental results were then utilized to validate the LCDU analytical model. The model assumes that LCDU is directly proportional to normalized dose sensitivity (NDS) and photon-acid statistics, namely the photon or acid counting within blur range. In the above design of experience, PAG loading, quencher loading and PEB temperature affect resist sensitivity as well as diffusion length or blur length. Although acid diffusion reduction leads to shorter blur length thus smaller photon counting area, dose increment contributes to higher photon density in the counting area. Therefore overall acid and photon statistics is improved and LCDU generally decreased with reduced acid diffusion. However, such benefits disappear at certain level and the lower limit of LCDU of this resist platform is observed. Besides acid diffusion, NDS impacts LCDU through as well, which can be achieved by varying the PAG type. In summary, this work help to understand how to manipulate different resist compositions to impact NDS and acid diffusion in order to improve LCDU.", "To achieve high volume manufacturing, EUV photoresists need to push back the \"RLS trade-off\" by simultaneously improving Resolution, Line-Width Roughness and Sensitivity (exposure dose). Acid diffusion in chemically amplified resist is known to impact these performances. This work studies the diffusion of acid in chemically amplified resist by varying the post exposure bake duration while monitoring the evolution of CD and LWR for 6 chemically amplified EUV photoresists (CAR).\nWe observed a first regime where both CD and LWR quickly decrease during the first 30s of post exposure bake (PEB). This can be related to the deprotection reaction taking place in the exposed part of the resist. After 60s the decrease in CD and LWR slows down significantly, likely related to a regime of acid diffusion from exposed to unexposed region, and acid-quencher neutralization at the interface of these two regions.\nWe tested two resists with different protecting group and the one having lower activation energy shows a faster CD change in the second regime, resulting in a worsening of LWR for longer PEB time. On the contrary, a resist with a high quencher loading shows reduced net diffusion of acid towards the unexposed region and controls the resist edge profile. In other words longer PEB does not degrade LWR, but as it reduces the line CD, sensitivity is impacted. With an appropriate ratio selection of quencher to PAG, an EUV dose reduction of up to 12% can be achieved with a change from a standard 60 second to a 240 second PEB time, while keeping LWR and resolution constant and therefore pushing the RLS performances.\nFinally, we confirmed that the observations on positive tone development (PTD) resist could be applied to negative tone development (NTD) resist: with a high quencher NTD resist we observed a dose reduction of 8% for longer PEB time, keeping LWR and resolution constant.", "We report on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) patterning performance of tin-oxo cages: molecular building blocks that are known to turn insoluble upon EUV exposure, thus having the properties of a negative tone photoresist. In this work, we focus on contrast curves of the materials using open-frame EUV exposures and their patterning capabilities using EUV interference lithography. It is shown that baking steps, such as post-exposure baking (PEB) can significantly affect both the sensitivity and contrast in the open-frame experiments as well as the patterning experiments. In addition, we show that the exchange of the anions of the cage can make a difference in terms of their physical properties. Our results demonstrate the significance of process optimization while evaluating the resist performance of novel molecular materials.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology is getting closer to high volume manufacturing phase every year. In order to enhance the yield in EUV lithography process, further improvement of defectivity is required at the moment. In this paper, optimized rinse and new dispense system (NDS) have been applied to a 24nm contact hole (CH) pattern in order to achieve defect reduction. As a result, the optimized rinse reduced approximately 70 % of residue defects. In addition, NDS for coating process exhibited 80 % defect reduction in particles in the coating films of material such as SOC, SOG, and resist.", "In this study, we evaluated the outgassing generated from EUV resist which included metal oxide nanoparticles during electron irradiation. We prepared two types of samples including ZrO2 and TeO2, and a sample without including metal oxide, respectively. The outgassing species were measured from each sample during electron irradiation at the Eth exposure dose. The electron acceleration energy was 2 keV. In the outgassing measurement, we used original in-situ outgassing monitoring system in quadrupole mass spectrometry which we developed. From the results of mass spectrum, we observed CO2, H2O as typical mass peaks at each sample. And also we observed C4H4O2 and C4H6O2 peaks in spectrum of each sample. And these peaks are guessed 2(5H)-furanone and butyrolactone generated from base polymer. C6H6 peaks were observed in the mass spectrum of including ZrO2 and TeO2. We guessed that these peaks are from benzene generated from photo-acid generator (PAG). On the other hand, C6H6 peaks were not observed in the mass spectrum of without metal oxide. About this, we could not explain that mechanism by our knowledge of the present, but we can guess that metal oxide nanoparticles worked to generate benzene. About metal oxide peaks did not observe about mass spectrum of each sample. Each metal or metal oxide might not be evaporated during electron irradiation.", "Irresistible Materials (IM) is a UK company spun out of the University of Birmingham. It is developing novel resist systems based on the Multi-trigger concept, and spin-on-carbon hardmask materials. IM has developed a new EUV resist that is nonmetal based, does not need a post exposure bake (PEB), and delivers high sensitivity, excellent contact hole resolution, with low LER. It is being readied for HVM through a partnership with Nano-C, Inc. (the Massachusetts based manufacturer of advanced electronic materials and chemicals). The transition to scalability will be the highlight of this discussion.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL, \u03bb = 13.5 nm) continues to be one of the most important candidates for future technology nodes. For the insertion of EUV lithography into device mass production, higher sensitivity of EUV resists is helpful for better cost of ownership of the EUV tool and light source. However, obtaining low sensitivity (S), high resolution (R), and low line edge roughness (L) simultaneously is very difficult. Many previous experiments by lithographers proved the existence of this \"RLS trade-off\"1-2. This paper furthers the work related to Photosensitized Chemically Amplified ResistTM (PSCAR)TM**, a chemistry which is trying to break the \"RLS tradeoff\" relationship. This chemistry was introduced as a new chemically amplified lithographic concept and is accomplished in an in-line track tool with secondary exposure module connected to EUV exposure tool.\nPSCAR is a modified CAR which contains a photosensitizer precursor (PP) in addition to other standard CAR components such as a protected polymer, a photo acid generator (PAG) and a quencher. In the PSCAR process, an improved chemical gradient can be realized by dual acid quenching steps with the help of increased quencher concentration. The addition of the PP, as well as other material optimization, offers more degrees of freedom for getting high sensitivity and low LER, but also makes the system more complicated. Thus coupling simulation and experimentation is the most rational approach to optimizing the overall process and for understanding complicated 2-D structures.\nIn this paper, we will provide additional background into the simulation of PSCAR chemistry, explore the effects of PSCAR chemistry on chemical contrast of complex structures (e.g. T structures, slot contacts, I/D bias for L/S), and explore the sensitivity enhancement levels capable while improving or maintaining lithographic performance. Finally, we will explore modifications of PSCAR chemistry on performance.", "The optimization problem of reducing EUV line edge roughness (LER) of a given feature, subject to the tolerance constraints on a CD of this feature at nominal EUV process conditions and several off-nominal conditions, is formulated. A stochastic rigorous Monte-Carlo EUV resist model is employed to solve this stochastic optimization problem. Several options for optimization algorithms, suitable for the solution of the formulated EUV LER optimization problem, are presented and discussed, along with the results of their tests.", "We present an experimental technique for determining the energy delivery efficiency of secondary electrons in an EUV resist, by directly exposing a positive tone chemically amplified resist with 29- 91 eV electrons created by utilizing the deceleration technology in a scanning electron microscope. Charging is an important problem associated with thin film exposure experiments. We assess the feasibility of using the SEM frame rate as a knob for controlling charging related artifacts. Preliminary measurements of secondary electron emission signal from an unexposed region in the resist provide clues about the time domain surface potentials that may form while the sample charges during exposures. These signals are found to change as a function of the SEM frame rate and landing energies. We provide contrast curve data for resist exposures with 29 eV, 49 eV and 91 eV electrons at three frame rates of 33 ms/frame, 8 s/frame and 30 s/frame. The energy delivery efficiency of electrons estimated for all three frame rates are also provided.", "For decades, downsizing has been a key issue for high performance and low cost of semiconductor, and extreme ultraviolet lithography is one of the promising candidates to achieve the goal. As a predominant process in extreme ultraviolet lithography on determining resolution and sensitivity, post exposure bake has been mainly studied by experimental groups, but development of its photoresist is at the breaking point because of the lack of unveiled mechanism during the process. Herein, we provide theoretical approach to investigate underlying mechanism on the post exposure bake process in chemically amplified resist, and it covers three important reactions during the process: acid generation by photo-acid generator dissociation, acid diffusion, and deprotection. Density functional theory calculation (quantum mechanical simulation) was conducted to quantitatively predict activation energy and probability of the chemical reactions, and they were applied to molecular dynamics simulation for constructing reliable computational model. Then, overall chemical reactions were simulated in the molecular dynamics unit cell, and final configuration of the photoresist was used to predict the line edge roughness. The presented multiscale model unifies the phenomena of both quantum and atomic scales during the post exposure bake process, and it will be helpful to understand critical factors affecting the performance of the resulting photoresist and design the next-generation material.", "13.5nm wavelength, CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source which is the most promising solution for the source capable of enabling high-volume-manufacturing of semiconductor devices with critical layers patterned with sub-10nm resolution. Our source incorporates unique and original technologies such as; high power short pulse CO2 laser, short wavelength solid-state pre-pulse laser, highly stabilized droplet generator, a laser-droplet shooting control system and debris mitigation technology utilizing a strong magnetic field. In this paper we present a technology update on the key components of our 250W CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source.", "A hydrogen plasma cleaning technique to clean Sn off of EUV sources is studied in detail. The cleaning process uses hydrogen radicals (formed in the hydrogen plasma) to interact with Sn-coated surfaces, forming SnH4 and being pumped away. This technique has been used to clean a 300mm-diameter stainless steel dummy collector optic, and EUV reflectivity of multilayer mirror samples was restored after cleaning Sn from them, validating the potential of this technology. A concern for plasma based methods is the implantation of high energy hydrogen ions into the MLM, reducing reflectivity and possibly blistering. With a surface wave plasma (SWP) this concern is alleviated somewhat because of lower ion energies. Surface wave plasmas have lower electron temperatures than conventional sources in the range of 1 to 3 eV. In addition, SWP sources result in plasma densities on the order of 1011-12 cm-3, allowing for greater utilization of ion etch enhancement. Experiments measuring radical density and etch rate profiles have been conducted and the results from these measurements are presented. These will help demonstrate scalability of SWP cleaning techniques for use in EUV sources.", "The cost of future computer chips, among other things, will depend on the performance of EUV sources and on the duration of the efficient operation and lifetime of nanolithography devices. While the efficiency of the sources is continuously being improved, their operational cycle is still highly restricted due to optical mirrors degradation as well as necessity of cleaning chamber environment and components.\nOne of the potential problems of EUV sources for high volume manufacture (HVM) regimes can be related to the contamination of chamber environment by products of preceding laser pulse/droplet interactions. Implementation of high, 100 kHz and higher, repetition rate of devices for Sn droplets and laser pulses generation can cause high accumulation of tin in the chamber in the form of vapor/clusters.\nPossible tin accumulation in the chamber in dependence on laser parameters and mitigation system efficiency was evaluated. Then, the effects of various pressures of tin vapor on the CO2 and Nd:YAG laser beams propagation and on the size, the intensity, and the efficiency of EUV sources produced were studied.", "An argon plasma in a magnetic cusp [1,2,3] thermalizes fast tin ions from the laser-plasma exhaust and guides their heat onto a large area beam dump. Demonstrations of plasma stability and particle control [2,3] have shown the magnetic field requirement to be modest and easily achievable with a very compact magnetic circuit. The plasma required for an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source power of 500W has a pressure of 640Pa and is contained in a cusp magnetic well with a containment B field of only 40mT. Superconducting magnets are not required and the conventional magnet power totals only 4kW. A cusp magnetic circuit of mild steel serves as part of the source chamber wall and has very small fringing fields. In 2015 [2] stable containment was demonstrated of an argon plasma at the exhaust power, temperature and density required for this application. Without B-field containment the same degree of tin ion control would require a large gas number density, necessitating the use of hydrogen for low EUV absorption, with its associated disadvantages of dissociation, tin hydride chemistry and re-cycling concerns. Without a guide B-field, the hydrogen throughput to carry away excess plasma heat is very large and the hydrogen flow is not directional, in contrast to the flow of a magnetically-controlled plasma, making scaling of the hydrogen technology very difficult. Substantially raised EUV source efficiency (40% improvement) is achievable via plasma guidance that conforms the shape of the cusp magnetic well to the EUV collector optic, allowing a collection solid angle as high as 7 sterad. This translates into a laser power as low as 30kW for 500W of EUV power. Because the plasma braking mechanism for fast tin ions is dominantly via electron Coulomb collisions [3], non-reactive argon gas can replace hydrogen as the plasma positive ion, and its flow rate can be much lower. In the argon cusp tin LPP source, the exhaust power is guided precisely onto a ring-shaped beam dump that receives argon ions of energy too low to cause back-sputtering of tin. A typical beam dump heat loading for a 500W EUV source will be 100W cm-2 or less. This combination of low-stress components, easy argon recycling and high source efficiency makes the further development of this technology very important for high volume manufacturing.", "Imprint lithography has been shown to be a promising technique for replication of nano-scale features. Jet and Flash Imprint Lithography* (J-FIL*) involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate.\nThere are many criteria that determine whether a particular technology is ready for wafer manufacturing. Included on the list are overlay, throughput and defectivity. The most demanding devices now require overlay of better than 4nm, 3 sigma. Throughput for an imprint tool is generally targeted at 80 wafers per hour. Defectivity and mask life play a significant role relative to meeting the cost of ownership (CoO) requirements in the production of semiconductor devices.\nThe purpose of this paper is to report the status of throughput and defectivity work and to describe the progress made in addressing overlay for advanced devices. In order to address high order corrections, a high order distortion correction (HODC) system is introduced. The combination of applying magnification actuation to the mask, and temperature correction to the wafer is described in detail and examples are presented for the correction of K7, K11 and K17 distortions as well as distortions on actual device wafers.", "A low cost alternative lithographic technology is desired to meet the decreasing feature size of semiconductor devices. Nano-imprint lithography (NIL) is one of the candidates for alternative lithographic technologies.[1][2][3] NIL has such advantages as good resolution, critical dimension (CD) uniformity and low line edge roughness (LER). On the other hand, the critical issues of NIL are defectivity, overlay, and throughput. In order to introduce NIL into the HVM, it is necessary to overcome these three challenges simultaneously.[4]-[12] In our previous study, we have reported a dramatic improvement in NIL process defectivity on a pilot line tool, FPA-1100 NZ2. We have described that the NIL process for 2x nm half pitch is getting closer to the target of HVM.[12] In this study, we report the recent evaluation of the NIL process performance to judge the applicability of NIL to memory device fabrications. In detail, the CD uniformity and LER are found to be less than 2nm. The overlay accuracy of the test device is less than 7nm. A defectivity level of below 1pcs./cm2 has been achieved at a throughput of 15 wafers per hour.", "Imprint lithography has been shown to be an effective technique for replication of nano-scale features.

By using material methods to reduce particle shedding and by introducing an air curtain system, test stand results demonstrate the potential for extending mask life to better than 1000 wafers.", "Imprint lithography is a promising technology for replication of nano-scale features. For semiconductor device applications, Canon deposits a low viscosity resist on a field by field basis using jetting technology. A patterned mask is lowered into the resist fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate.\nThere are two critical components to meeting throughput requirements for imprint lithography. Using a similar approach to what is already done for many deposition and etch processes, imprint stations can be clustered to enhance throughput. The FPA-1200NZ2C is a four station cluster system designed for high volume manufacturing.\nFor a single station, throughput includes overhead, resist dispense, resist fill time (or spread time), exposure and separation. Resist exposure time and mask/wafer separation are well understood processing steps with typical durations on the order of 0.10 to 0.20 seconds. To achieve a total process throughput of 17 wafers per hour (wph) for a single station, it is necessary to complete the fluid fill step in 1.2 seconds. For a throughput of 20 wph, fill time must be reduced to only one 1.1 seconds.\nThere are several parameters that can impact resist filling. Key parameters include resist drop volume (smaller is better), system controls (which address drop spreading after jetting), Design for Imprint or DFI (to accelerate drop spreading) and material engineering (to promote wetting between the resist and underlying adhesion layer). In addition, it is mandatory to maintain fast filling, even for edge field imprinting. In this paper, we address the improvements made in all of these parameters to first enable a 1.20 second filling process for a device like pattern and have demonstrated this capability for both full fields and edge fields. Non-fill defectivity is well under 1.0 defects/cm2 for both field types. Next, by further reducing drop volume and optimizing drop patterns, a fill time of 1.1 seconds was demonstrated.", "Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a promising technique for fine-patterning with a lower cost than other lithography techniques such as EUV or immersion with multi-patterning.

The required 3D master structures were fabricated using direct laser-writing lithography with two-photon absorption. Master structures were replicated into poly(methyl methacrylate) through a poly(dimethyl siloxane) intermediate copying step and exposed with 172 nm UV light. Due to the reduction of glass transition temperature in a surface-confined layer, roughness in the range of more than 100 nm could subsequently be smoothed-out to below 10 nm by annealing the surface by heating.", "Fabrication processes that microelectronic developed for Integrated circuit (IC) technologies for decades, do not meet the new emerging structuration\u2019s requirements, in particular non-IC related technologies one, such as MEMS/NEMS, Micro-Fluidics, photovoltaics, lenses. Actually complex 3D structuration requires complex lithography patterning approaches such as gray-scale electron beam lithography, laser ablation, focused ion beam lithography, two photon polymerization. It is now challenging to find cheaper and easiest technique to achieve 3D structures.\nIn this work, we propose a straightforward process to realize 3D structuration, intended for silicon based materials (Si, SiN, SiOCH). This structuration technique is based on nano-imprint lithography (NIL), ion implantation and selective wet etching. In a first step a pattern is performed by lithography on a substrate, then ion implantation is realized through a resist mask in order to create localized modifications in the material, thus the pattern is transferred into the subjacent layer. Finally, after the resist stripping, a selective wet etching is carried out to remove selectively the modified material regarding the non-modified one.\nIn this paper, we will first present results achieved with simple 2D line array pattern processed either on Silicon or SiOCH samples. This step have been carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of this new structuration process. SEM pictures reveals that \u201cinfinite\u201d selectivity between the implanted areas versus the non-implanted one could be achieved. We will show that a key combination between the type of implanted ion species and wet etching chemistries is required to obtain such results.\nThe mechanisms understanding involved during both implantation and wet etching processes will also be presented through fine characterizations with Photoluminescence, Raman and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) for silicon samples, and ellipso-porosimetry and Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR) for SiOCH samples. Finally the benefit of this new patterning approach will be presented on 3D patterns structures.", "Nanoimprint lithography, NIL, is gathering much attention as one of the most potential candidates for the next generation lithography for semiconductor. This technology needs no pattern data modification for exposure, simpler exposure system, and single step patterning process without any coat/develop truck, and has potential of cost effective patterning rather than very complex optical lithography and/or EUV lithography. NIL working templates are made by the replication of the EB written high quality master templates. Fabrication of high resolution master templates is one of the most important issues. Since NIL is 1:1 pattern transfer process, master templates have 4 times higher resolution compared with photomasks. Another key is to maintain the quality of the master templates in replication process. NIL process is applied for the template replication and this imprint process determines most of the performance of the replicated templates. Expectations to the NIL are not only high resolution line and spaces but also the contact hole layer application. Conventional ArF-i lithography has a certain limit in size and pitch for contact hole fabrication. On the other hand, NIL has good pattern fidelity for contact hole fabrication at smaller sizes and pitches compared with conventional optical lithography. Regarding the tone of the templates for contact hole, there are the possibilities of both tone, the hole template and the pillar template, depending on the processes of the wafer side. We have succeeded to fabricate both types of templates at 2xnm in size. In this presentation, we will be discussing fabrication or our replica template for the contact hole layer application. Both tone of the template fabrication will be presented as well as the performance of the replica templates. We will also discuss the resolution improvement of the hole master templates by using various e-beam exposure technologies.", "Directed Self-Assembly is the method by which a self-assembly polymer is forced to follow a desired geometry defined or influenced by a guiding pattern. Such guiding pattern uses surface potentials, confinement or both to achieve polymer configurations that result in circuit-relevant topologies, which can be patterned onto a substrate.\nChemo, and grapho epitaxy of lines and space structures are now routinely inspected at full wafer level to understand the defectivity limits of the materials and their maximum resolution. In the same manner, there is a deeper understanding about the formation of cylinders using grapho-epitaxy processes. Academia has also contributed by developing methods that help reduce the number of masks in advanced nodes by \u201ccombining\u201d DSA-compatible groups, thus reducing the total cost of the process.\nFrom the point of view of EDA, new tools are required when a technology is adopted, and most technologies are adopted when they show a clear cost-benefit over alternative techniques. In addition, years of EDA development have led to the creation of very flexible toolkits that permit rapid prototyping and evaluation of new process alternatives. With the development of high-chi materials, and by moving away of the well characterized PS-PMMA systems, as well as novel integrations in the substrates that work in tandem with diblock copolymer systems, it is necessary to assess any new requirements that may or may not need custom tools to support such processes.\nHybrid DSA processes (which contain both chemo and grapho elements), are currently being investigated as possible contenders for sub-5nm process techniques. Because such processes permit the re-distribution of discontinuities in the regular arrays between the substrate and a cut operation, they have the potential to extend the number of applications for DSA.\nThis paper illustrates the reason as to why some DSA processes can be supported by existing rules and technology, while other processes require the development of highly customized correction tools and models. It also illustrates how developing DSA cannot be done in isolation, and it requires the full collaboration of EDA, Material\u2019s suppliers, Manufacturing equipment, Metrology, and electronic manufacturers.", "To a major candidate and beyond, directed self-assembly (DSA) lithography is investigated on DRAM contact-hole fabrication. We perform a systematic study about behavior of asymmetric PS-b-PMMA block copolymers (BCP) within pillar confinement for DSA and find that selectively removed PMMA contact domain has a different morphology according to chemically modified pillar surfaces. We calculate the perturbation of PMMA contacts by pillar diameter using free energy magnitude model. This established model provides practical engineering insight for present pillar scheme and future graphoepitaxial self-assembly techniques for semiconductor DSA procedure.", "Directed Self Assembly (DSA) has emerged as one of the most compelling next generation patterning techniques for sub-7nm via or contact layers. A key issue in enabling DSA as a mainstream patterning technique is the generation of grapho-epitaxy based guiding pattern (GP) shapes to assemble the contact patterns on target with high fidelity and resolution. Current GP generation is mostly empirical, and limited to a very small number of via configurations. In this paper, we propose the first model-based GP synthesis algorithm and methodology for on-target and robust DSA, on general via pattern configurations. The final post-RET printed GPs derived from our original synthesized GPs are resilient to process variations and continue to maintain the same DSA fidelity in terms of placement error and target shape.", "Direct Optimization (DO) of a 3D DSA model is a more optimal approach to a DTCO study in terms of accuracy and speed compared to a Cahn Hilliard Equation solver. DO\u2019s shorter run time (10X to 100X faster) and linear scaling makes it scalable to the area required for a DTCO study. However, the lack of temporal data output, as opposed to prior art, requires a new calibration method. The new method involves a specific set of calibration patterns. The calibration pattern\u2019s design is extremely important when temporal data is absent to obtain robust model parameters. A model calibrated to a Hybrid DSA system with a set of device-relevant constructs indicates the effectiveness of using nontemporal data. Preliminary model prediction using programmed defects on chemo-epitaxy shows encouraging results and agree qualitatively well with theoretical predictions from a strong segregation theory.", "Maskless lithography using parallel electron beamlets is a promising solution for next generation scalable maskless nanolithography. Researchers have focused on this goal but have been unable to find a robust technology to generate and control high-quality electron beamlets with satisfactory brightness and uniformity. In this work, we will aim to address this challenge by developing a revolutionary surface-plasmon-enhanced-photoemission (SPEP) technology to generate massively-parallel electron beamlets for maskless nanolithography. The new technology is built upon our recent breakthroughs in plasmonic lenses, which will be used to excite and focus surface plasmons to generate massively-parallel electron beamlets through photoemission. Specifically, the proposed SPEP device consists of an array of plasmonic lens and electrostatic micro-lens pairs, each pair independently producing an electron beamlet. During lithography, a spatial optical modulator will dynamically project light onto individual plasmonic lenses to control the switching and brightness of electron beamlets. The photons incident onto each plasmonic lens are concentrated into a diffraction-unlimited spot as localized surface plasmons to excite the local electrons to near their vacuum levels. Meanwhile, the electrostatic micro-lens extracts the excited electrons to form a focused beamlet, which can be rastered across a wafer to perform lithography. Studies showed that surface plasmons can enhance the photoemission by orders of magnitudes. This SPEP technology can scale up the maskless lithography process to write at wafers per hour. In this talk, we will report the mechanism of the strong electron-photon couplings and the locally enhanced photoexcitation, design of a SPEP device, overview of our proof-of-concept study, and demonstrated parallel lithography of 20-50 nm features.", "In this study, a simulation analysis of a miniaturized electron optics for the Multi-Column Massively Parallel Electron Beam Writing system is demonstrated. Analytical evaluation of space charge effect with prototype Massively Parallel Electron Beam Writing (MPEBW) system showed 2.86 nm blur in radius occurs on each beam with a convergence half angle of 3 mrad. The angle of each beam was increased to 10 mrad to reduce the space charge effect, the coulomb blur amount can be kept to less than 1 nm in radius. However, there was limitation to increasing the angle due to a spherical aberration. Since the beam current density from the electron emitter array in the prototype MPEBW system was 100 \u03bcA/cm2 and the total beam current was 1\u03bcA with 100\u00d7100 array of 10\u03bcm square emitter, the influence of coulomb blur was small. By contrast, considerably increasing the number of beams and the beam current are planned in near future in MPEBW. The coulomb blur and other aberrations will not be controlled by merely adjusting the beam convergence angle. In order to increase total beam current, miniaturized electron optics have been designed for Multi-beam+Multi-column system. Reduction lens in the designed miniaturized electron optics with crossover free to reduce the influence of coulomb repulsion with narrow convergence half angle. Unlike conventional methods, the electron beams as principal rays do not intersect at one point, so even if the beam becomes extremely narrow, the coulomb repulsion effect does not increase at the crossover area. The reduction of the entire size of parallel beams in the designed electron optics was confirmed by simulation software. The simulation results showed that least confusion disk of 6.5 nm size was obtained at the beam convergence half angles of 3 mrad corresponding to the incident beam of \u00b10.1 mrad divergence angle. It showed that the miniaturized electron optics was suitable for 10 nm order EB writing. The crossover free electron optics of the miniaturized electron optics is possible due to dispersing the intersection points of the principal rays by a combination of a concentric electron optics and a tapered lens electrode of the reduction lens.", "Mapper Lithography has introduced its first product, the FLX\u20131200, which is installed at CEA-Leti in Grenoble (France). This is a mask less lithography system, based on massively parallel electron-beam writing with high-speed optical data transport for switching the electron beams. This FLX platform is initially targeted for 1 wph performance for 28 nm technology nodes, but can also be used for less demanding imaging. The electron source currently integrated is capable of scaling to 10 wph at the same resolution performance, which will be implemented by gradually upgrading the illumination optics. The system has an optical alignment system enabling mix-and-match with optical 193 nm immersion systems using standard NVSM marks. The tool at CEA-Leti is in-line with a Sokudo Duo clean track. Mapper Lithography and CEA-Leti are working in collaboration to develop turnkey solution for specific applications. At previous conferences we have presented imaging results including 28nm node resolution, cross wafer CDu of 2.5nm 3\uf073 and a throughput of half a wafer per hour, overhead times included. At this conference we will present results regarding the overlay performance of the FLX-1200. In figure 2 an initial result towards measuring the overlay performance of the FLX-1200 is shown. We have exposed a wafer twice without unloading the wafer in between exposures. In the first exposure half of a dense dot array is exposed. In the second exposure the remainder of the dense dot array is exposed. After development the wafer has been inspected using a CD-SEM at 480 locations distributed over an area of 100mm x 100mm. For each SEM image the shift of the pattern written in the first exposure relative to the pattern written in the second exposure is measured. Cross wafer this shift is 7 nm u+3s in X and 5 nm u+3s in Y. The next step is to evaluate the impact of unloading and loading of the wafer in between exposures. At the conference the latest results will be presented.", "DSA patterning is a promising solution for advanced lithography as a complementary technique to standard and future lithographic technologies. In this work, we focused on DSA grapho-epitaxy process-flow dedicated for contact hole applications using polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) block copolymers. We investigated the impact on the DSA performances of the surface affinity of a guiding pattern design by ArF immersion lithography. The objective was to control and reduce the polymer residue at the bottom of the guiding pattern cavities since it can lead to lower a DSA-related defectivity after subsequent transfer of the DSA pattern. For this purpose, the DSA performances were evaluated as a function of the template surface affinity properties. The surface affinities were customized to enhance DSA performances for a PS-b-PMMA block copolymer (intrinsic period 35nm, cylindrical morphology) by monitoring three main key parameters: the hole open yield (HOY), the critical dimension uniformity (CDU-3\u03c3) and the placement error (PE-3\u03c3). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was conjointly carried out on the optimized wafers to characterize the residual polymer thickness after PMMA removal. The best DSA process performances (i.e., hole open yield: 100%, CDU-3\u03c3: 1.3nm and PE-3\u03c3: 1.3nm) were achieved with a thickness polymer residue of 7 nm. In addition, the DSA-related defectivity investigation performed by review-SEM enabled us to achieve a dense (pitch 120nm) contact area superior to 0.01mm2 free of DSA-related defects. This result represents more than 6x105 SEM-inspected valid contacts, attesting the progress achieved over the last years and witnessing the maturity of the DSA in the case of contact holes shrink application.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) has been investigated over the past few years as the candidate for next generation lithography. Especially, sub 20nm line and space patterns obtained by chemo-epitaxy process are expected to apply to DRAM active area, Logic fin and narrow metal patterns. One of the biggest advantages of DSA lines is that the pattern pitch is decided by the specific factors of the block copolymer, and it indeed the small pitch walking as a consequence. However, the generating mechanism of the DSA pattern defect is still not cleared1-4 and the line edge roughness (LER) is not overtaken self- aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP).\nIn this report, we present the latest results regarding the defect reduction and LER improvement work regarding chemoepitaxy line and space pattern. In addition, we introduce the result of application of chemical epitaxy process to hole pattern.", "One of technical issues of directed self-assembly lithography is extremely narrow patterning range. It is really difficult to make not only smaller patterns (pitch of less than 30nm) because of self-assembling limit but also middle patterns (pitch of more than 60nm) because of material synthesis issues. This paper describes wide\u2013range directed self-assembly lithography which enables not only narrow patterns but also wide patterns using newly developed block copolymer. One block of the new block copolymer is easily metalized selectively by metalize technology and it is confirmed that dry etching resistance is markedly improved.", "In this paper the rules-based correction strategies for the nanoimprint lithography (NIL) technology are addressed using complete Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) characterizations. Performed onto 200 mm wafers imprinted with the HERCULES NIL equipment platform, Critical Dimension (CD) uniformity analyses are used to measure the evolution of lines and spaces features dimensions from the master to 50 consecutive imprints. The work brings focus on sub micrometer resolution features with duty cycles from 3 to 7. The silicon masters were manufactured with 193 optical lithography and dry etching and were fully characterized prior to the imprint process. Repeatability tests were performed over 50 wafers for two different processes to collect statistical and comparative data. The data revealed that the CD evolutions can be modelled by quadratic functions with respect to the number of imprints and feature dimension (CD and pitch) on the master. These models are used to establish the rules-based corrections for lines arrays in the scope of nanoimprint master manufacturing, and it opens the discussion on the process monitoring through metrology for the nanoimprint soft stamp technologies.", "Technologies for pattern fabrication using imprint process are being developed for various devices. Nanoimpirnt lithography (NIL) is an attractive and promising candidate for its pattern fidelity toward finer device fabrication without using double patterning. To apply smaller pattern size device, layout dependent hotspots becomes a significant issue, so design for manufacturing (DFM) flow considering imprint process has to be prepared. In this paper, focused on fine resist spread, RLT (Residual Layer Thickness) uniformity improvement utilizing simulation is demonstrated and resist drop compliance check flow is proposed", "Directed Self Assembly (DSA) of block-copolymers (BCPs) used as a complementary technique to the 193nm immersion lithography has demonstrated sub-10nm node applications in both via and line/space patterning. We propose however to study the performance of graphoepitaxy which allows DSA with thicker initial BCP layer, higher multiplication factors and stronger orientation control of lamellae. The aim of this work is to use the 300mm pilot line available at LETI and Arkema\u2019s advanced materials to evaluate the performances of a novel graphoepitaxy process based on the work on a 38nm period lamellar PS-b-PMMA (L38) reported before.", "Since multi patterning with spacer was introduced in NAND flash memory1, multi patterning with spacer has been a promising solution to overcome the resolution limit. However, the increase in process cost of multi patterning with spacer must be a serious burden to device manufacturers as half pitch of patterns gets smaller.2, 3 Even though Nano Imprint Lithography (NIL) has been considered as one of strong candidates to avoid cost issue of multi patterning with spacer, there are still negative viewpoints; template damage induced from particles between template and wafer, overlay degradation induced from shear force between template and wafer, and throughput loss induced from dispensing and spreading resist droplet. Jet and Flash Imprint Lithography (J-FIL4, 5, 6) has contributed to throughput improvement, but still has these above problems. J-FIL consists of 5 steps; dispense of resist droplets on wafer, imprinting template on wafer, filling the gap between template and wafer with resist, UV curing, and separation of template from wafer. If dispensing resist droplets by inkjet is replaced with coating resist at spin coater, additional progress in NIL can be achieved. Template damage from particle can be suppressed by thick resist which is spin-coated at spin coater and covers most of particles on wafer, shear force between template and wafer can be minimized with thick resist, and finally additional throughput enhancement can be achieved by skipping dispense of resist droplets on wafer. On the other hand, spin-coat-based NIL has side effect such as pattern collapse which comes from high separation energy of resist. It is expected that pattern collapse can be improved by the development of resist with low separation energy.", "Nano-imprint lithography (NIL) is an emerging high-resolution parallel patterning method, mainly aimed towards fields in which high-end photolithography methods are costly and do not provide sufficient resolution at reasonable throughput. High resolution stamp patterning can currently be performed by electron and ion dual beam system. By scanning the focused electron beam (or ion beam) while injecting a suitable organometallic precursor gas around the location of e-beam (or ion beam) and just above the stamp substrate, a high-density and high-uniformity hard mask for subsequent etching without use proximity-effect correction techniques. Furthermore, this technique can also directly deposit a metal pattern for interconnect or a dielectric pattern on NIL stamp without the need for separate metal or dielectric deposition, photoresist etch-mask, and etching processes. FEI Helios Nano Lab\u2122 1200 and Nova Nano Lab\u2122 600 dual beam system are used in this work for NIL stamp inspection and fabrication.", "Directed Self Assembly (DSA) has emerged as one of the most compelling next generation patterning techniques for sub-7nm via or contact layers.

The final post-RET printed GPs derived from our original synthesized GPs are resilient to process variations and continue to maintain the same DSA fidelity in terms of placement error and target shape.", "Electrical test measurement in the back-end of line (BEOL) is crucial for wafer and die sorting as well as comparing intended process splits. Any in-line, nondestructive technique in the process flow to accurately predict these measurements can significantly improve mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) of defects and improve cycle times for yield and process learning. Measuring after BEOL metallization is commonly done for process control and learning, particularly with scatterometry (also called OCD (Optical Critical Dimension)), which can solve for multiple profile parameters such as metal line height or sidewall angle and does so within patterned regions. This gives scatterometry an advantage over inline microscopy-based techniques, which provide top-down information, since such techniques can be insensitive to sidewall variations hidden under the metal fill of the trench. But when faced with correlation to electrical test measurements that are specific to the BEOL processing, both techniques face the additional challenge of sampling. Microscopy-based techniques are sampling-limited by their small probe size, while scatterometry is traditionally limited (for microprocessors) to scribe targets that mimic device ground rules but are not necessarily designed to be electrically testable. A solution to this sampling challenge lies in a fast reference-based machine learning capability that allows for OCD measurement directly of the electrically-testable structures, even when they are not OCD-compatible. By incorporating such direct OCD measurements, correlation to, and therefore prediction of, resistance of BEOL electrical test structures is significantly improved. Improvements in prediction capability for multiple types of in-die electrically-testable device structures is demonstrated. To further improve the quality of the prediction of the electrical resistance measurements, hybrid metrology using the OCD measurements as well as X-ray metrology (XRF) is used. Hybrid metrology is the practice of combining information from multiple sources in order to enable or improve the measurement of one or more critical parameters. Here, the XRF measurements are used to detect subtle changes in barrier layer composition and thickness that can have second-order effects on the electrical resistance of the test structures. By accounting for such effects with the aid of the X-ray-based measurements, further improvement in the OCD correlation to electrical test measurements is achieved. Using both types of solution incorporation of fast reference-based machine learning on nonOCD-compatible test structures, and hybrid metrology combining OCD with XRF technology improvement in BEOL cycle time learning could be accomplished through improved prediction capability.", "In this paper we discuss the edge placement error (EPE) for multi-patterning semiconductor manufacturing. In a multi-patterning scheme the creation of the final pattern is the result of a sequence of lithography and etching steps, and consequently the contour of the final pattern contains error sources of the different process steps. We describe the fidelity of the final pattern in terms of EPE, which is defined as the relative displacement of the edges of two features from their intended target position. We discuss our holistic patterning optimization approach to understand and minimize the EPE of the final pattern. As an experimental test vehicle we use the 7-nm logic device patterning process flow as developed by IMEC. This patterning process is based on Self-Aligned-Quadruple-Patterning (SAQP) using ArF lithography, combined with line cut exposures using EUV lithography. The computational metrology method to determine EPE is explained. It will be shown that ArF to EUV overlay, CDU from the individual process steps, and local CD and placement of the individual pattern features, are the important contributors. Based on the error budget, we developed an optimization strategy for each individual step and for the final pattern. Solutions include overlay and CD metrology based on angle resolved scatterometry, scanner actuator control to enable high order overlay corrections and computational lithography optimization to minimize imaging induced pattern placement errors of devices and metrology targets.", "Scaling of interconnect design rules in advanced nodes has been accompanied by a reducing metrology budget for BEOL process control. Traditional inline optical metrology measurements of BEOL processes rely on 1-dimensional (1D) film pads to characterize film thickness. Such pads are designed on the assumption that solid copper blocks from previous metallization layers prevent any light from penetrating through the copper, thus simplifying the effective film stack for the 1D optical model. However, the reduction of the copper thickness in each metallization layer and CMP dishing effects within the pad, have introduced undesired noise in the measurement. To resolve this challenge and to measure structures that are more representative of product, scatterometry has been proposed as an alternative measurement. Scatterometry is a diffraction based optical measurement technique using Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), where light diffracted from a periodic structure is used to characterize the profile. Scatterometry measurements on 3D structures have been shown to demonstrate strong correlation to electrical resistance parameters for BEOL Etch and CMP processes. However, there is significant modeling complexity in such 3D scatterometry models, in particlar due to complexity of front-end-of-line (FEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) structures. The accompanying measurement noise associated with such structures can contribute significant measurement error. To address the measurement noise of the 3D structures and the impact of incoming process variation, a hybrid scatterometry technique is proposed that utilizes key information from the structure to significantly reduce the measurement uncertainty of the scatterometry measurement. Hybrid metrology combines measurements from two or more metrology techniques to enable or improve the measurement of a critical parameter. In this work, the hybrid scatterometry technique is evaluated for 7nm and 14nm node BEOL measurements of interlayer dielectric (ILD) thickness, hard mask thickness and dielectric trench etch in complex 3D structures. The data obtained from the hybrid scatterometry technique demonstrates stable measurement precision, improved within wafer and wafer to wafer range, robustness in cases where 3D scatterometry measurements incur undesired shifts in the measurements, accuracy as compared to TEM and correlation to process deposition time. Process capability indicator comparisons also demonstrate improvement as compared to conventional scatterometry measurements. The results validate the suitability of the method for monitoring of production BEOL processes.", "The development and integration of new materials and structures at the nanoscale require multiple parallel characterizations in order to control mostly physico-chemical properties as a function of applications. Among all properties, we can list physical properties such as: size, shape, specific surface area, aspect ratio, agglomeration/aggregation state, size distribution, surface morphology/topography, structure (including crystallinity and defect structure), solubility and chemical properties such as: structural formula/molecular structure, composition (including degree of purity, known impurities or additives), phase identity, surface chemistry (composition, charge, tension, reactive sites, physical structure, photocatalytic properties, zeta potential), hydrophilicity/lipophilicity. Depending on the final material formulation (aerosol, powder, nanostructuration\u2026) and the industrial application (semiconductor, cosmetics, chemistry, automotive\u2026), a fleet of complementary characterization equipments must be used in synergy for accurate process tuning and high production yield. The synergy between equipment so-called hybrid metrology consists in using the strength of each technique in order to reduce the global uncertainty for better and faster process control. The only way to succeed doing this exercise is to use data fusion methodology. In this paper, we will introduce the work that has been done to create the first generic hybrid metrology software platform dedicated to nanotechnologies process control. The first part will be dedicated to process flow modeling that is related to a fleet of metrology tools. The second part will introduce the concept of entity model which describes the various parameters that have to be extracted. The entity model is fed with data analysis as a function of the application (automatic analysis or semi-automated analysis). The final part will introduce two ways of doing data fusion on real data coming from imaging (SEM, TEM, AFM) and non-imaging techniques (SAXS). First approach is dedicated to high level fusion which is the art of combining various populations of results from homogeneous or heterogeneous tools, taking into account precision and repeatability of each of them to obtain a new more accurate result. The second approach is dedicated to deep level fusion which is the art of combining raw data from various tools in order to create a new raw data. We will introduce a new concept of virtual tool creator based on deep level fusion. As a conclusion we will discuss the implementation of hybrid metrology in semiconductor environment for advanced process control", "Reducing overlay error via an accurate APC feedback system is one of the main challenges in high volume production of the current and future nodes in the semiconductor industry. The overlay feedback system directly affects the number of dies meeting overlay specification and the number of layers requiring dedicated exposure tools through the fabrication flow. Increasing the former number and reducing the latter number is beneficial for the overall efficiency and yield of the fabrication process. An overlay feedback system requires accurate determination of the overlay error, or fingerprint, on exposed wafers in order to determine corrections to be automatically and dynamically applied to the exposure of future wafers. Since current and future nodes require correction per exposure (CPE), the resolution of the overlay fingerprint must be high enough to accommodate CPE in the overlay feedback system, or overlay control module (OCM). Determining a high resolution fingerprint from measured data requires extremely dense overlay sampling that takes a significant amount of measurement time. For static corrections this is acceptable, but in an automated dynamic correction system this method creates extreme bottlenecks for the throughput of said system as new lots have to wait until the previous lot is measured. One solution is using a less dense overlay sampling scheme and employing computationally up-sampled data to a dense fingerprint. That method uses a global fingerprint model over the entire wafer; measured localized overlay errors are therefore not always represented in its up-sampled output. This paper will discuss a hybrid system shown in Fig. 1 that combines a computationally up-sampled fingerprint with the measured data to more accurately capture the actual fingerprint, including local overlay errors. Such a hybrid system is shown to result in reduced modelled residuals while determining the fingerprint, and better on-product overlay performance.", "In this publication the authors have investigated both theoretically and experimentally the link between line edge roughness, target noise and overlay mark fidelity. Based on previous worki , a model is presented to explain how any given edge of a printed feature could have a mean position that varies stochastically (i.e., randomly, following a normal distribution) due to lithography stochastic variation. The amount of variation is a function of the magnitude of the LER (more accurately, all the statistical properties of the LER) and the length of the feature edge. These quantities have been analytically linked to provide an estimate for the minimum line length for both optical and e-beam based overlay metrology. The model results have been compared with experimental results from wafers manufactured at IMEC on both EUV and ArF lithographic processes developed for the 10 nm node, with extrapolation to the 5 nm node.", "The optical coupling between gratings in diffraction-based overlay triggers a swing-curve1,6 like response of the target\u2019s signal contrast and overlay sensitivity through measurement wavelengths and polarizations. This means there are distinct measurement recipes (wavelength and polarization combinations) for a given target where signal contrast and overlay sensitivity are located at the optimal parts of the swing-curve that can provide accurate and robust measurements. Some of these optimal recipes can be the ideal choices of settings for production. The user has to stay away from the non-optimal recipe choices (that are located on the undesirable parts of the swing-curve) to avoid possibilities to make overlay measurement error that can be sometimes (depending on the amount of asymmetry and stack) in the order of several \u201cnm\u201d. To accurately identify these optimum operating areas of the swing-curve during an experimental setup, one needs to have full-flexibility in wavelength and polarization choices. In this technical publication, a diffraction-based overlay (DBO) measurement tool with many choices of wavelengths and polarizations is utilized on advanced production stacks to study swing-curves. Results show that depending on the stack and the presence of asymmetry, the swing behavior can significantly vary and a solid procedure is needed to identify a recipe during setup that is robust against variations in stack and grating asymmetry. An approach is discussed on how to use this knowledge of swing-curve to identify recipe that is not only accurate at setup, but also robust over the wafer, and wafer-to-wafer. KPIs are reported in run-time to ensure the quality / accuracy of the reading (basically acting as an error bar to overlay measurement).", "Traditionally, the total measurement uncertainty (TMU) of overlay metrology focuses on dynamic precision, toolinduced-shift, and matching, while rarely examining inaccuracy. However, some researchers have recently shown that measurement inaccuracy can still be large despite optimized small TMU. Moreover, this inaccuracy can consume a significant portion of the overlay budget in the advanced nodes. In addition to qualifying the overlay error of inline wafers, overlay metrology is also used for improving on-product overlay as it provides corrective feedback to the lithography scanner. The accuracy of the correction terms as a result depends directly upon the measurement accuracy. As such, enhanced overlay accuracy will improve the overlay performance of reworked wafers, or subsequently exposed wafers. We have previously shown that a segmented Blossom target is more prone to asymmetry-induced inaccuracy than a nonsegmented target is [1]. Since target segmentation is inevitable for SADP and SAQP patterning processes, their resulting overlay performance leaves a lot to be desired. In our quest to reach for the true overlay, this paper reports our investigations on accuracy enhancement techniques for image-based targets, such as redundancy and self-calibration, and on the use of simulation-optimized scatterometry-based targets.", "Technology shrinkage leads to tight specifications in advanced semiconductor industries. For several years\u2019, metrology for lithography has been a key technology to address this challenge and to improve yield. More specifically overlay metrology is the object of special attention for tool suppliers and semiconductor manufacturers. This work focuses on Image Based Overlay (IBO) metrology for 28 nm FD-SOI CMOS front-end critical steps (gate and contact). With Overlay specifications below 10 nm, accuracy of the measurement is critical. In this study we show specific cases where target designs need to be optimized in order to minimize process effects (CMP, etch, deposition, etc.) that could lead to overlay measurement errors. Another important aspect of the metrology target is that its design must be device-like in order to better control and correct overlay errors leading to yield loss. Methodologies to optimize overlay metrology recipes are also presented. If the process effects cannot be removed entirely by target design optimization, recipe parameters have to be carefully chosen and controlled to minimize the influence of the target imperfection on measured overlay. With target asymmetry being one of the main contributors to those residual overlay measurement errors the Qmerit accuracy flag can be used to quantify the measurement error and recipe parameters can be set accordingly in order to minimize the target asymmetry impact. Reference technique measurements (CD-SEM) were used to check accuracy of the optimized overlay measurements.", "Overlay control based on DI metrology of optical targets has been the primary basis for run-to-run process control for many years. In previous work we described a scenario where optical overlay metrology is performed on metrology targets on a high frequency basis including every lot (or most lots) at DI. SEM based FI metrology is performed ondevice in-die as-etched on an infrequent basis. Hybrid control schemes of this type have been in use for many process nodes. What is new is the relative size of the NZO as compared to the overlay spec, and the need to find more comprehensive solutions to characterize and control the size and variability of NZO at the 1x nm node: sampling, modeling, temporal frequency and control aspects, as well as trade-offs between SEM throughput and accuracy.", "Overlay measurements are done for verification of the exposure and creation of process corrections for the next lots. As throughput of the overlay measurement tools is limited, it is desirable to avoid unnecessary measurements. Another concern can be that in-transparent stacks do not allow measuring a critical overlay relation directly. We developed methods for calculation of the overlay relation between two different layers between which there is no direct overlay measurement. We qualify the impact of sampling plans and the number of dependent layers. The indirect overlay calculation is applied on a significant high volume data set.", "This paper will provide a high level overview of the future for in-line high volume manufacturing (HVM) metrology for the semiconductor industry, concentrating on logic applications. First, we will take a broad view of the needs of patterned defect, critical dimensional (CD/3D), overlay and films metrology, and present the extensive list of applications for which metrology solutions are needed. Commonalities and differences among the various applications will be shown. We will then report on the gating technical limits of the most important of these metrology solutions to address the metrology challenges of future nodes, highlighting key metrology technology gaps requiring industry attention and investment", "A methodology to evaluate the memory cell property of STT-MRAM (Spin Transfer Torque-Magnetic Random Access Memory) with a CD-SEM (Critical Dimension-Scanning Electron Microscope) was proposed. STTMRAM is one of the promising candidates among various emerging memories, owing to its low power consumption, low latency, and excellent endurance. Meanwhile, the major issues of STT-MRAM are its small resistance window and the etching-induced damage during memory pillar formation process. The resistance variability and the damage region should be minimized to achieve the reliable operation and the size scaling. The correlation analysis between the resistance and the physical dimension was performed. It provided quantitative information required for process development and control, such as the size-independent resistance variability, the width of the damaged region, and the origin of the short failures. They are essential for the investigation of the causes for the cell-to-cell resistance variability as well as for the quantification of the damage during etching process.", "We introduce a set of designed tools for the analysis of lithography patterns and nano structures. The classical metrological analysis of these objects has the drawbacks of being time consuming, requiring manual tuning and lacking robustness and user friendliness. With the goal of improving the current situation, we propose new image processing tools at different levels: semi automatic, automatic and machine-learning enhanced tools. The complete set of tools has been integrated into a software platform designed to transform the lab into a virtual fab. The underlying idea is to master nano processes at the research and development level by accelerating the access to knowledge and hence speed up the implementation in product lines.", "We summarize the metrology and inspection required for the development of nanoimprint lithography (NIL), which is recognized as a candidate for next-generation lithography. Template inspection and residual layer thickness (RLT) metrology are discussed. An optical-based inspection tool for replica template inspection showed sensitivity for defects below 10 nm with sufficient throughput. For the RLT control, in-die RLT metrology is needed. Because the metrology requires dense sampling, optical scatterometry is the best solution owing to its ability to measure profile features nondestructively with high throughput. For in-die metrology, we have developed a new hybrid metrology that can combine key information from these complex geometries with scatterometry measurements to reduce the impact on the RLT measurement due to the layers beneath the resist. The technologies discussed here will be important when NIL is applied for IC manufacturing, as well as in the development phases of those lithography technologies.", "Realizing sensitive, high throughput and robust overlay measurement is a challenge in current 14nm and advanced upcoming nodes with transition to 300mm and upcoming 450mm semiconductor manufacturing, where slight deviation in overlay has significant impact on reliability and yield1). Exponentially increasing number of critical masks in multi-patterning lithoetch, litho-etch (LELE) and subsequent LELELE semiconductor processes require even tighter overlay specification2). Here, we discuss limitations of current image- and diffraction- based overlay measurement techniques to meet these stringent processing requirements due to sensitivity, throughput and low contrast3). We demonstrate a new electrical measurement based technique where resistance is measured for a macro with intentional misalignment between two layers. Overlay is quantified by a parabolic fitting model to resistance where minima and inflection points are extracted to characterize overlay control and process window, respectively. Analyses using transmission electron microscopy show good correlation between actual overlay performance and overlay obtained from fitting. Additionally, excellent correlation of overlay from electrical measurements to existing image- and diffraction- based techniques is found. We also discuss challenges of integrating electrical measurement based approach in semiconductor manufacturing from Back End of Line (BEOL) perspective. Our findings open up a new pathway for accessing simultaneous overlay as well as process window and margins from a robust, high throughput and electrical measurement approach.", "EUV lithography is promising for addressing upcoming, <10nm nodes for the semiconductor industry, but with this promise comes the need for reliable metrology techniques. In particular, there is a need for actinic mask inspection in which the imaging wavelength matches that of the intended lithography process, so that the most relevant defects are detected. Here, we demonstrate tabletop, ptychographic, coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) in reflection- and transmission-modes of extended samples, using a 13 nm high harmonic generation (HHG) source. We achieve the first sub-wavelength resolution EUV image (0.9\u03bb) in transmission, the highest spatial resolution using any 13.5 nm source to date. We also present the first reflection-mode image obtained on a tabletop using 12.7 nm light. This work represents the first 12.7 nm reflection-mode image using any source of a general sample.", "We introduce an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) mask defect review system (EMDRS) which has been developing in SAMUSNG. It applies a stand-alone high harmonic generation (HHG) EUV source as well as simple EUV optics consisting of a folding mirror and a zoneplate. The EMDRS has been continuously updated and utilized for various applications regarding defect printability in EUVL. One of the main roles of the EMDRS is to verify either mask repair or mask defect avoidance (MDA) by actinic reviews of defect images before and after the process. Using the MDA, small phase defects could be hidden below absorber patterns, but it is very challenging in case of layouts with high density patterns. The EMDRS clearly verify the success of the MDA while conventional SEM could not detect the images. In addition, we emulate images of the sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) by the EMDRS and compared them with the wafer exposure results.", "With extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography getting ready to enter high volume manufacturing, there is an imminent need to address EUV mask metrology infrastructure. Actinic defect inspection of patterned EUV photomasks has been identified as an essential step for mask qualification, but there is no commercial tool available right now. We address this gap with the RESCAN tool, a defect inspection platform being built at Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), co-developed in collaboration with Nuflare Inc, Japan. RESCAN uses Scanning Scattering Contrast Microscopy (SSCM) and Scanning Coherent Diffraction Imaging (SCDI) for fast defect detection and fine defect localization. The development of a stand-alone tool based on these techniques relies on the availability of (1) a bright coherent EUV source with a small footprint and (2) a high frame-rate pixel detector with extended dynamic range and high quantum efficiency for EUV. We present two in-house projects at PSI addressing the development of these components: COSAMI and JUNGFRAU. COSAMI (COmpact Source for Actinic Mask Inspection), is a high-brightness EUV source optimized for EUV photons with a relatively small footprint. JUNGFRAU (adJUstiNg Gain detector FoR the Aramis User station) is a silicon-based hybrid pixel detector, developed in house at PSI and prototyped for EUV. With a high frame rate and dynamic range at 13.5 nm, this sensor solution is an ideal candidate for the RESCAN platform. We believe that these ongoing source and sensor programs will pave the way towards a comprehensive solution for actinic patterned mask inspection bridging the gap of actinic defect detection and identification on EUV reticles.", "Process-induced overlay errors from outside the litho cell have become a significant contributor to the overlay error budget including non-uniform wafer stress. Previous studies have shown the correlation between process-induced stress and overlay and the opportunity for improvement in process control, including the use of patterned wafer geometry (PWG) metrology to reduce stress-induced overlay signatures. Key challenges of volume semiconductor manufacturing are how to improve not only the magnitude of these signatures, but also the wafer to wafer variability. This work involves a novel technique of using PWG metrology to provide improved litho-control by wafer-level grouping based on incoming process induced overlay, relevant for both 3D NAND and DRAM. Examples shown in this study are from 19 nm DRAM manufacturing.", "As device shrink, there are many difficulties with process integration and device yield. Lithography process control is expected to be a major challenge due to tighter overlay and focus control requirement. The understanding and control of stresses accumulated during device fabrication has becoming more critical at advanced technology nodes. Within-wafer stress variations cause local wafer distortions which in turn present challenges for managing overlay and depth of focus during lithography. A novel technique for measuring distortion is Coherent Gradient Sensing (CGS) interferometry, which is capable of generating a high-density distortion data set of the full wafer within a time frame suitable for a high volume manufacturing (HVM) environment. In this paper, we describe the adoption of CGS (Coherent Gradient Sensing) interferometry into high volume foundry manufacturing to overcome these challenges. Leveraging this high density 3D metrology, we characterized its In-plane distortion as well as its topography capabilities applied to the full flow of an advanced foundry manufacturing. Case studies are presented that summarize the use of CGS data to reveal correlations between in-plane distortion and overlay variation as well as between topography and device yield.", "Non-linear overlay deformation is a well-known problem in critical lithography steps. A significant root cause is nonuniform stress, often caused by high temperature processes. Non-uniform stress in the wafer causes vertical deformation of the wafer, which can be measured by topography measurement equipment. In this case study, clustering is done on the topography data to sort each wafer into groups. Using the context information from the clustering, overlay feedback is computed on a wafer level basis. The evaluation of the approach is done with a run-to-run simulation, which allows optimization of this method and evaluation of the on-product overlay performance improvement. In the analysis, different wafer zones are distinguished to characterize the improvement potential for the different zones.", "At SPIE 2013 in Metrology, Inspection, and Process Control for Microlithography an invited paper was published titled \u201cIn-line E-beam wafer metrology and defect inspection: the end of an era for image-based critical dimensional metrology? New life for defect inspection\u201d. Three years have passed and numerous developments have occurred as predicted in this paper. The development of E-beam tools that can concurrently handle metrology and defect applications is one of the primary developments. In this paper, the capabilities of these new E-beam tools and their current use cases will be discussed in the areas of Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU), In-die overlay, Hot spot and Physical defect inspection. Emphasis will be placed on use cases where \u201cmassive\u201d CDU data is collected in order to increase yield learning for manufacturing (14nm) and decrease cycles of learning for development (7nm). Additionally, some of the other subject material from the previous publication will also be discussed such as the current state of E-beam critical dimension image fidelity and physical defect detection capabilities. Lastly, future directions and opportunities for In-line E-beam including Multi-beam and/or Multi-column E-beam will be discussed.", "Engineers are continually faced with decisions about how much data they can collect. In this work, we present a statistically-based smart sampling methodology which can be used to target data collection and ensure that the risk to the product is clearly understood. Smart sampling combines knowledge of the distributions of control statistics with knowledge of the run length distributions they induce to balance the cost of information against the ability to respond to anomalies. We define and explore three characteristics that any sampling plan deemed \u201csmart\u201d must explicitly address: control errors that are associated with basing decisions on sample data, jeopardy that is associated with uncertainty about the true condition of the process, and the switching mechanism that controls the dynamic response to the latest information about the process. We show how the interplay of these characteristics can be exploited to comprehend the merits of a sampling plan. Practical examples of optical product inspection and process defectivity control are presented and explained.", "In this paper we proposed a new semiconductor quality monitoring methodology \u2013 Process Sensor Log Analysis (PSLA) \u2013 using process sensor data for the detection of wafer defectivity and quality monitoring. We developed exclusive key parameter selection algorithm and user friendly system which is able to handle large amount of big data very effectively. Several production wafers were selected and analyzed based on the risk analysis of process driven defects, for example alignment quality of process layers. Thickness of spin-coated material can be measured using PSLA without conventional metrology process. In addition, chip yield impact was verified by matching key parameter changes with electrical die sort (EDS) fail maps at the end of the production step. From this work, we were able to determine that process robustness and product yields could be improved by monitoring the key factors in the process big data.", "After critical lithography steps, overlay and CD are measured to determine if the wafers need to be re-worked. Traditionally, overlay metrics are applied per X/Y-direction and, a CD metric is computed independently. From design standpoint, electrical failure is based on a complex interaction between CD deviations and overlay errors. We propose a method including design constraints, where results of different measurement steps are not judged individually, but in a combined way. We illustrate this with a critical design feature consisting of a contact requiring minimum distance to a neighboring metal line, resulting in much better correlation to yield than traditional methods.", "With photolithography as the fundamental patterning step in the modern nanofabrication process, every wafer within a semiconductor fab will pass through a lithographic apparatus multiple times. With more than 20,000 sensors producing more than 700GB of data per day across multiple subsystems, the combination of a light source and lithographic apparatus provide a massive amount of information for data analytics. This paper outlines how data analysis tools and techniques that extend insight into data that traditionally had been considered unmanageably large, known as adaptive analytics, can be used to show how data collected before the wafer is exposed can be used to detect small process dependent wafer-towafer changes in overlay.", "Surface topography on post-CMP processing can be measured with white light interference microscopy to determine the planarity. Results are used to avoid under or over polishing and to decrease dishing. The numerical output of the surface topography is the RMS (root-mean-square) of the height. Beyond RMS, the topography image is visually examined and not further quantified. Subjective comparisons of the height maps are used to determine optimum CMP process conditions. While visual comparison of height maps can determine excursions, it\u2019s only through manual inspection of the images. In this work we describe methods of quantifying post-CMP surface topography characteristics that are used in other technical fields such as geography and facial-recognition. The topography image is divided into small surface patches of 7x7 pixels. Each surface patch is fitted to an analytic surface equation, in this case a third order polynomial, from which the gradient, directional derivatives, and other characteristics are calculated. Based on the characteristics, the surface patch is labeled as peak, ridge, flat, saddle, ravine, pit or hillside. The number of each label and thus the associated histogram is then used as a quantified characteristic of the surface topography, and could be used as a parameter for SPC (statistical process control) charting. In addition, the gradient for each surface patch is calculated, so the average, maximum, and other characteristics of the gradient distribution can be used for SPC. Repeatability measurements indicate high confidence where individual labels can be lower than 2% relative standard deviation. When the histogram is considered, an associated chi-squared value can be defined from which to compare other measurements. The chi-squared value of the histogram is a very sensitive and quantifiable parameter to determine the within wafer and wafer-to-wafer topography non-uniformity. As for the gradient histogram distribution, the chi-squared could again be calculated and used as yet another quantifiable parameter for SPC. In this work we measured the post Cu CMP of a die designed for 14nm technology. A region of interest (ROI) known to be indicative of the CMP processing is chosen for the topography analysis. The ROI, of size 1800 x 2500 pixels where each pixel represents 2um, was repeatably measured. We show the sensitivity based on measurements and the comparison between center and edge die measurements. The topography measurements and surface patch analysis were applied to hundreds of images representing the periodic process qualification runs required to control and verify CMP performance and tool matching. The analysis is shown to be sensitive to process conditions that vary in polishing time, type of slurry, CMP tool manufacturer, and CMP pad lifetime.

We previously established proof of concept for a systematic approach to identify the most critical pattern locations, i.e. hotspots, in a reticle layout by computational lithography and combining process window characteristics of these patterns with across-wafer process variation data to predict where hotspots may become yield impacting defects [1,2]. The current paper establishes the impact of micro-topography on a 28nm metal layer, and its correlation with hotspot best focus variations across a production chip layout. Detailed topography measurements are obtained from an offline tool, and pattern-dependent best focus (BF) shifts are determined from litho simulations that include mask-3D effects. We also establish hotspot metrology and defect verification by SEM image contour extraction and contour analysis. This enables detection of catastrophic defects as well as quantitative characterization of pattern variability, i.e. local and global CD uniformity, across a wafer to establish hotspot defect and variability maps. Finally, we combine defect prediction and verification capabilities for process monitoring by on-product, guided hotspot metrology, i.e. with sampling locations being determined from the defect prediction model and achieved prediction accuracy (capture rate) around 75%", "Line edge placement error is a limiting factor in multipatterning schemes which are required for advanced nodes in high volume manufacturing for the semiconductor industry. Thus, we aim to develop an approach which provides both a quantitative estimate of whether a segment of a feature edge is in the ideal location and a quantitative estimate of the long wavelength roughness. The method is described, numerical simulation models its application to the issue of distortion caused by SEM aberrations, and the method is applied to a sample data set of SEM images. We show that the method gives a robust estimate of a major component leading to feature edge placement error. Long wavelength distortions either from SEM aberrations or from long wavelength noise have a clear statistical signature. This methodology applied to a large, consistently acquired SEM data set allows estimates as to important elements required to assess the line edge placement error issue and to whether there is underlying long wavelength roughness which arises from physical sources", "Stochastic-induced roughness of lithographic features continues to be of great concern due to its impact on semiconductor devices. In particular, rare events (large deviations in edge positions due to roughness) can cause catastrophic failure of a chip, but are hard to predict. Here, a new methodology, the level crossing method, is used to characterize the statistical behavior of edge roughness with the goal of predicting extreme events. Using experimental results from EUV lithography, the distribution of edge deviations was found to have tails significantly heavier than a normal distribution. While further work is required, these heavy tails could prove problematic when EUV is used in high volume manufacturing.", "Line-edge roughness (LER) has important impacts on the quality of semiconductor device performance, and power spectrum estimates are useful tools in characterizing it. These estimates are often obtained by taking measurements of many lines and averaging a classical power spectrum estimate from each one. While this approach improves the variance of the estimate there are disadvantages to the collection of many measurements with current microscopy techniques. We propose techniques with widespread application in other fields which simultaneously reduce data requirements and variance of LER power spectrum estimates over current approaches at the price of computational complexity. Multitaper spectral analysis uses an orthogonal collection of data windowing functions or tapers on a set of data to obtain a set of approximately statistically independent spectrum estimates. The Welch overlapped segment averaging spectrum estimate is an earlier approach to reusing data. There are known techniques to calculate error bars for these families of spectrum estimators, and we experiment with random rough lines simulated by Mack\u2019s technique based on the Thorsos method.", "Metrology of nanoscale patterns poses multiple challenges that range from measurement noise, metrology errors, probe size etc. Optical Metrology has gained a lot of significance in the semiconductor industry due to its fast turn around and reliable accuracy, particularly to monitor in-line process variations. Apart from monitoring critical dimension, thickness of films, there are multiple parameters that can be extracted from Optical Metrology models3. Sidewall angles, material compositions etc., can also be modeled to acceptable accuracy. Line edge and Line Width roughness are much sought of metrology following critical dimension and its uniformity, although there has not been much development in them with optical metrology. Scanning Electron Microscopy is still used as a standard metrology technique for assessment of Line Edge and Line Width roughness. In this work we present an assessment of Optical Metrology and its ability to model roughness from a set of structures with intentional jogs to simulate both Line edge and Line width roughness at multiple amplitudes and frequencies. We also present multiple models to represent roughness and extract relevant parameters from Optical metrology. Another critical aspect of optical metrology setup is correlation of measurement to a complementary technique to calibrate models. In this work, we also present comparison of roughness parameters extracted and measured with variation of image processing conditions on a commercially available CD-SEM tool.", "The CD SEM (Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope) is one of the main tools used to estimate Critical Dimension (CD) in semiconductor manufacturing nowadays, but, as all metrology tools, it will face considerable challenges to keep up with the requirements of the future technology nodes. The root causes of these challenges are not uniquely related to the shrinking CD values, as one might expect, but to the increase in complexity of the devices in terms of morphology and chemical composition as well. In fact, complicated threedimensional device architectures, high aspect ratio features, and wide variety of materials are some of the unavoidable characteristics of the future metrology nodes. This means that, beside an improvement in resolution, it is critical to develop a CD SEM metrology capable of satisfying the specific needs of the devices of the nodes to come, needs that sometimes will have to be addressed through dramatic changes in approach with respect to traditional CD SEM metrology. In this paper, we report on the development of advanced CD SEM metrology at imec on a variety of device platform and processes, for both logic and memories. We discuss newly developed approaches for standard, IIIV, and germanium FinFETs (Fin Field Effect Transistors), for lateral and vertical nanowires (NW), 3D NAND (three-dimensional NAND), STT-MRAM (Spin Transfer Magnetic Torque Random-Access Memory), and ReRAM (Resistive Random Access Memory). Applications for both front-end of line (FEOL) and back-end of line (BEOL) are developed. In terms of process, S/D Epi (Source Drain Epitaxy), SAQP (Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning), DSA (Dynamic Self-Assembly), and EUVL (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) have been used. The work reported here has been performed on Hitachi CG5000, CG6300, and CV5000. In terms of logic, we discuss here the S/D epi defect classification, the metrology optimization for STI (Shallow Trench Isolation) Ge FinFETs, the defectivity of III-V STI FinFETs,, metrology for vertical and horizontal NWs. With respect to memory, we discuss a STT-RAM statistical CD analysis and its comparison to electrical performance, ReRAM metrology for VMCO (Vacancy-modulated conductive oxide) with comparison with electrical performance, 3D NAND ONO (Oxide Nitride Oxide) thickness measurements. In addition, we report on 3D morphological reconstruction using CD SEM in conjunction with FIB (Focused Ion Beam), on optimized BKM (Best Known Methods) development methodologies, and on CD SEM overlay. The large variety of results reported here gives a clear overview of the creative effort put in place to ensure that the critical potential of CD SEM metrology tools is fully enabled for the 5nm node and beyond.", "SEM images provide valuable information about patterning capability. Geometrical properties such as Critical Dimension (CD) can be extracted from them and are used to calibrate OPC models, thus making OPC more robust and reliable. However, there is currently a shortage of appropriate metrology tools to inspect complex two-dimensional patterns in the same way as one would work with simple one-dimensional patterns. In this article we present a full framework for the analysis of SEM images. It has been proven to be fast, reliable and robust for every type of structure, and particularly for two-dimensional structures. To achieve this result, several innovative solutions have been developed and will be presented in the following pages. Firstly, we will present a new noise filter which is used to reduce noise on SEM images, followed by an efficient topography identifier, and finally we will describe the use of a topological skeleton as a measurement tool that can extend CD measurements on all kinds of patterns.", "Today\u2019s CD-SEM metrology is challenged when it comes to measuring complex features found in patterning hotspots (like tip to tip, tip to side, necking and bridging). Metrology analysis tools allow us to extract SEM contours of a feature and convert them into a GDS format from which dimensional data can be extracted. While the CD-SEM is being used to take images, the actual measurement and the choice of what needs to be measured is done offline. Most of the time this method is used for OPC model creation but barely for process variability analysis at nominal process conditions. We showed in a previous paper [1] that it is possible to study lithography to etch transfer behavior of a hotspot using SEM contours. The goal of the current paper is to go extend this methodology to quantify process variability of 2D features using a new tooling to measure contour data.", "Given the potential impact of distortions within the Field Of View (FOV) of the SEM, we need a method to quantify and describe them. We will show a method to find the magnitude and directions of the distortions. This description will enable assessment of impact on local distance measurements like edge placement errors (EPE) analysis and contour measurements. Knowing the distortions with sufficient resolution and stability can also enable corrections for this phenomenon. We will show that applying this correction in post processing, we can bring back the absolute measurement error from 1.5 nm to 0.3 nm.", "Qualitative comparisons have been made in the literature between the scattering off deep-subwavelength-sized defects and the scattering off spheres in free space to illustrate the challenges of optical defect inspection with decreasing patterning sizes. The intensity scattered by such a sphere (for diameters sized well below the wavelength) is proportional to its diameter to the sixth power, but also scales inversely to the fourth power of the wavelength. This paper addresses through simulation the potential advantages of applying shorter wavelengths for improved patterned defect inspection. Rigorous finite-difference time-domain 3-D electromagnetic modeling of the scattering from patterned defect layouts has been performed at five wavelengths which span the deep ultraviolet (193 nm), the vacuum ultraviolet (157 nm and 122 nm), and the extreme ultraviolet (47 nm and 13 nm). These patterned structures and defects are based upon publicly disclosed geometrical cross-sectional information from recent manufacturing processes, which then have been scaled down to an 8 nm Si linewidth. Simulations are performed under an assumption that these wavelengths have the same source intensity, noise sources, and optical configuration, but wavelengthdependent optical constants are considered, thus yielding a more fundamental comparison of the potential gains from wavelength scaling. To make these results more practical, future work should include simulations with more process stacks and with more materials as well as the incorporation of available source strengths, known microscope configurations, and detector quantum efficiencies. In this study, a 47 nm wavelength yielded enhancements in the signal-to-noise by a factor of five compared to longer wavelengths and in the differential intensities by as much as three orders-of-magnitude compared to 13 nm, the actinic wavelength for EUV semiconductor manufacturing.", "General approaches to realize higher sensitivity in optical inspection system are using shorter wavelength including UV and higher NA for objective lens. Extreme performances of imaging and illumination systems in a situation of wellmatched to each other are inevitable for the further effort on an effective optical detection of fine defects in patterned wafer. This study focused on the dark field illumination systems satisfying hi areal uniformity and concentration efficiency for the specific conditions of non-symmetric illumination area and critical slanted angle. Three different types of anamorphic dark field illumination systems namely, Far-field Areal Illumination (FAI), Near-field Areal Illumination (NAI) and Farfield Linear Illumination (FLI), are designed and evaluated by brightness, uniformity and concentration efficiency of beam intensity.", "The semiconductor industry is moving toward a half-pitch of 7 nm. The required metrology equipment should be one order of magnitude more accurate than that. Any metrology tool is only as good as it is calibrated. The characterization of metrology systems requires test patterns that are one order of magnitude smaller than the measured features. The test sample was designed in such a way that the distribution of linewidths appears to be random at any location and any magnification. The power spectral density of such pseudo-random test pattern is inherently flat, down to the minimum size of lines. Metrology systems add a cut-off of the spectra at high frequencies; the shape of the cut-off characterizes the system in its entire dynamic range. This method is widely used in optics, and has allowed optical systems to be perfected down to their diffraction limit. There were attempts to use the spectral method to characterize nanometrology systems such as SEMs, but the absence of natural samples with known spatial frequencies was a common problem. Pseudo-random test patterns with linewidths down to 1.5 nm were fabricated. The system characterization includes the imaging of a pseudo-random test sample and image analysis by a developed software to automatically extract the power spectral density and the contrast transfer function of the nanoimaging system.", "The availability of metrology solutions, one of the key factors to drive leading edge semiconductor devices and processes, can be confronted with difficulties in the advanced node. For developing new metrology solutions, high quality test structures fabricated at specific sizes are needed. Conventional resist-based lithography have been utilized to manufacture such samples. However, it can encounter significant resolution difficulties or requiring complicated optimization process for advanced technology node. In this work, potential of helium ion beam direct milling (HIBDM) for fabricating metrology test structures with programmed imperfection is investigated. Features down to 5 nm are resolvable without implementing any optimization method. Preliminary results have demonstrated that HIBDM can be a promising alternative to fabricate metrology test structures for advanced metrology solutions in sub 10 nm node.", "A novel method of sub-nanometer uncertainty for the 3D-profile measurement and LWR (Line Width Roughness) measurement by using FIB (Focused Ion Beam) processing, and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) and CD-SEM (Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope) images measurement is proposed to standardize 3D-profile measurement through reference metrology. In this article, we apply the methodology to line profile measurements and roughness measurement of advanced FinFET (Fin-shaped Field-Effect Transistor) features. The FinFET features are horizontally sliced as a thin specimen by FIB micro sampling system. Horizontally images of the specimens are obtained then by a planar TEM. LWR is calculated from the edges positions on TEM images. Moreover, we already have demonstrated the novel on-wafer 3D-profile metrology as \"FIB-to-CDSEM method\" with FIB slope cut and CD-SEM measuring. Using the method, a few micrometers wide on a wafer is coated and cut by 45-degree slope using FIB tool. Then, the wafer is transferred to CD-SEM to measure the cross section image by top down CD-SEM measurement. We applied FIB-to-CDSEM method to a CMOS image sensor feature. The 45-degree slope cut surface is observed using AFM. The surface profile of slope cut surface and line profiles are analyzed for improving the accuracy of FIB-to-CDSEM method.", "The logic manufacturing process requires small in-device metrology targets to exploit the full dose correction potential of the modern scanners and process tools. A high-NA angular resolved scatterometer (YieldStar S-1250D) was modified to demonstrate the possibility of OCD measurements on 5x5\u00b5m2 targets. The results obtained on test wafers in a logic manufacturing environment, measured after litho and after core etch, showed a good correlation to larger reference targets and AEI to ADI intra-field CDU correlation, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of OCD on such small targets. The data was used to determine a reduction potential of 55% for the intra-field CD variation, using 145 points per field on a few inner fields, and 33% of the process induced across wafer CD variation using 16 points per field full wafer. In addition, the OCD measurements reveal valuable information on wafer-to-wafer layer height variations within a lot.", "Device scaling has not only driven the use of measurements on more complex structures, in terms of geometry, materials, and tighter ground rules, but also the need to move away from non-patterned measurement sites to patterned ones. This is especially of concern for very thin film layers that have a high thickness dependence on structure geometry or wafer pattern factor. Although 2-dimensional (2D) sites are often found to be sufficient for process monitoring and control of very thin films, sometimes 3D sites are required to further simulate structures within the device. The measurement of film thicknesses only a few atoms thick on complex 3D sites, however, are very challenging. Apart from measuring thin films on 3D sites, there is also a critical need to measure parameters on 3D sites, which are weak and less sensitive for OCD (Optical Critical Dimension) metrology, with high accuracy and precision. Thus, state-ofthe-art methods are needed to address such metrology challenges. This work introduces the concept of Enhanced OCD which uses various methods to improve the sensitivity and reduce correlations for weak parameters in a complex measurement. This work also describes how more channels of information, when used correctly, can improve the precision and accuracy of weak, non-sensitive or complex parameters of interest.", "In this paper we propose a \u201cfilm on grating\u201d (FoG) measurement technique using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) that can enable sub-\u00c5ngstrom level precision for multi-layer film thickness measurement on topographies that closely approximate the device structure. FoG follows the industry trends to 'measure what matters' and provides thickness measurement data from patterned structures that has much stronger correlation to actual device performance. We also explore the impact of deviations in the film stack that can appreciably alter the device performance. One of the key device performance metrics that we will investigate is the leakage current, which is highly sensitive to process variations or defectivity. Measuring both the thickness and the bandgap of the HK dielectric permits excellent correlation with leakage current as determined by electrical testing of the device. The ability to predict electrical parameters effectively will greatly accelerate learning cycles during process development and can enable real time product control on existing inline metrology tools.", "Optical 3-D nanostructure metrology utilizes a model-based metrology approach to determine critical dimensions (CDs) that are well below the inspection wavelength. Our project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology is evaluating how to attain key CD and shape parameters from engineered in-die capable metrology targets. More specifically, the CDs are determined by varying the input parameters for a physical model until the simulations agree with the actual measurements within acceptable error bounds. As in most applications, establishing a reasonable balance between model accuracy and time efficiency is a complicated task. A well-established simplification is to model the intrinsically finite 3-D nanostructures as either periodic or infinite in one direction, reducing the computationally expensive 3-D simulations to usually less complex 2-D problems. Systematic errors caused by this simplified model directly influence the fitting of the model to the measurement data and are expected to become more apparent with decreasing lengths of the structures. In this paper we investigate these effects, and will report experimental set-ups, e.g., the used illumination numerical apertures and focal ranges, that can increase the validity of the 2-D approach.", "The evaluation of scatterometry for monitoring intended variations in innovative scatterometry targets that mimic nonuniformities potentially caused by multibeam Maskless Lithography (MEB-ML2) is presented. Specialized scatterometry targets consisting of lines and spaces were produced that have portions exposed using the nominal, or POR (Process of Record), dose, and portions exposed with a slightly different dose. These exposure plans created targets with different line CDs (critical dimensions). Multiple target designs were implement, each with a different combination of magnitude of CD shift and size of the region containing lines with a shifted CD. The scatterometry, or OCD (Optical Critical Dimension), spectra show clear shifts caused by the regions with shifted CD, and trends of the scatterometry results match well with trends of the estimated CD as well as the trends produced by measurements using a critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) system. Finally, the OCD results are correlated to the CD-SEM measurements. Taking into account resist morphology variations across the wafer, correlations between OCD and CD-SEM of the weighted average CD across the various targets are shown to be very good. Correlations are done using the rigorous TMU analysis methodology. Due to the different targeted CD values within each scatterometry structure, a new methodology for estimating the error of the CD-SEM measurements for nominally non-uniform targets is presented.", "The majority of scatterometric production control models assume constant optical properties of the materials and only dimensional parameters are allowed to vary. However, this assumption, especially in case of thin-metal films, negatively impacts model precision and accuracy. In this work we focus on optical modeling of the TiN metal hardmask for scatterometry applications. Since the dielectric function of TiN exhibits thickness dependence, we had to take this fact into account. Moreover, presence of the highly absorbing films influences extracted thicknesses of dielectric layers underneath the metal films. The later phenomenon is often not reflected by goodness of fit. We show that accurate optical modeling of metal is essential to achieve desired scatterometric model quality for automatic process control in microelectronic production. Presented modeling methodology can be applied to other TiN applications such as diffusion barriers and metal gates as well as for other metals used in microelectronic manufacturing for all technology nodes.", "The semiconductor industry continues to drive patterning solutions that enable devices with higher memory storage capacity, faster computing performance, and lower cost per transistor. These developments in the field of semiconductor manufacturing along with the overall minimization of the size of transistors require continuous development of metrology tools used for characterization of these complex 3D device architectures. Optical scatterometry or optical critical dimension (OCD) is one of the most prevalent inline metrology techniques in semiconductor manufacturing because it is a quick, precise and non-destructive metrology technique. However, at present OCD is predominantly used to measure the feature dimensions such as line-width, height, side-wall angle, etc. of the patterned nano structures. Use of optical scatterometry for characterizing defects such as pitch-walking, overlay, line edge roughness, etc. is fairly limited. Inspection of process induced abnormalities is a fundamental part of process yield improvement. It provides process engineers with important information about process errors, and consequently helps optimize materials and process parameters. Scatterometry is an averaging technique and extending it to measure the position of local process induced defectivity and feature-to-feature variation is extremely challenging. This report is an overview of applications and benefits of using optical scatterometry for characterizing defects such as pitch-walking, overlay and fin bending for advanced technology nodes beyond 7nm. Currently, the optical scatterometry is based on conventional spectroscopic ellipsometry and spectroscopic reflectometry measurements, but generalized ellipsometry or Mueller matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry data provides important, additional information about complex structures that exhibit anisotropy and depolarization effects. In addition the symmetry-antisymmetry properties associated with Mueller matrix (MM) elements provide an excellent means of measuring asymmetry present in the structure. The useful additional information as well as symmetry-antisymmetry properties of MM elements is used to characterize fin bending, overlay defects and design improvements in the OCD test structures are used to boost OCDs\u2019 sensitivity to pitch-walking. In addition, the validity of the OCD based results is established by comparing the results to the top down critical dimensionscanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) and cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) images.", "Monte Carlo-based SEM image simulation can reproduce SEM micrographs by calculating scattering events of primary electrons inside the target materials. By using the simulated SEM images, it is possible to optimize imaging conditions prior to the specimen observation, which could save time for finding suitable observation condition. However, a recent trend of miniaturized and 3-dimentional structures of semiconductor devices, and introduction of various novel materials have created a challenge for such SEM image simulation techniques; that is, more precise and accurate modeling is required. In this paper, we present a quantitatively accurate BSE simulation and a precise parameters setting in voltage contrast simulation, for both to reproduce experimental SEM images accurately. We apply these simulation techniques to optimize the accelerating voltage of SEM for sub-surface imaging, and to analyze a charge distribution on the insulating specimen under the electron irradiation. These applications promise the advancement in developing a new device by preparing inspecting condition in a timely manner.", "The miniaturization of semiconductors continues, importance of overlay measurement is increasing. We measured overlay with analysis SEM called Miracle Eye which can output ultrahigh acceleration voltage in 1998. Meanwhile, since 2006, we have been working on SEM based overlay measurement and developed overlay measurement function of the same layer using CD-SEM. Then, we evaluated overlay of the same layer pattern after etching. This time, in order to measure overlay after lithography, we evaluated the see-through overlay using high voltage SEM CV5000 released in October 2016. In collaboration between imec and Hitachi High-Technologies, we evaluated repeatability, TIS of SEM-OVL as well as correlation between SEM-OVL and Opt-OVL in the M1@ADI and V0@ADI process. Repeatability and TIS results are reasonable and SEM-OVL has good correlation with Opt-OVL. By overlay measurement using CV 5000, we got the following conclusions. (1)SEM_OVL results of both M1 and V0 at ADI show good correlation to OPT_OVL. (2)High voltage SEM can prove the measurement capability of a small pattern(Less than 1~2um) like device that can be placed in-die area. (3)\"In-die SEM based overlay\" shows possibility for high order control of scanner", "Voltage contrast (VC) images obtained using an energy filter (EF) were used to measure the bottom surface of high-aspect- ratio (HAR) structures. The VC images obtained using the conventional EF were sensitive to variations in wafer potential. Since CD-SEM metrology requires precise EF voltage control when using VC images, we developed an EF voltage correction method to be used at each measurement point. Consequently, bottom-edge measurement, independent of the wafer potential fluctuations, was achieved by using the newly developed EF. Our developed technique is effective for CD-SEM metrology using VC images.", "In recent trend of semiconductor manufacturing, accurate critical dimension (CD) metrology is required to realize miniaturized three-dimensional (3D) structures. However, the conventional edge contrast of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is often suppressed when imaging the deep bottom of the 3D structures. In this paper, we propose effective approaches realizing the improved SEM image contrast for such metrology targets. Our approach utilizes the principle of the SEM contrast, and optimizes the three major influencing factors of SEM contrast; signal generation, signal propagation inside the specimen, and signal detection by the detectors. We show the examples of improved image contrast including, embedded voids imaging by high landing beam energy, contact-hole bottom imaging by angular selective detections, and precise edge position extraction realized by energy-angular selective imaging.", "Sidewall image transfer has become a key enabler of future design shrink. It is consisted of several process steps that multiply the number of lithography backbone patterns in a self-aligned form, shrinking pattern and pitch sizes. The quality of the image transfer process depends on the characteristics of the sidewall pattern morphology. Rectangular Sidewalls with a flat top and vertical edges will result with symmetrical and uniform etched image. On the other hand, Facet top, bent sidewalls, sloped edges or foot, may distort the etched image. In this paper we present a description of the 3DSEM metrology technique used, simulation results, and demonstrate three dimensional characterization of Sidewalls pattern fabricated with different etch recipes: Top Facet measurements vs cross section images; Edge slop and foot characterization", "When design rule is mitigating to smaller dimension, process variation requirement is tighter than ever and challenges the limits of device yield. Masks, lithography, etching and other processes have to meet very tight specifications in order to keep defect and CD within the margins of the process window. Conventionally, Inspection and metrology equipments are utilized to monitor and control wafer quality in-line. In high throughput optical inspection, nuisance and review-classification become a tedious labor intensive job in manufacturing. Certain high-resolution SEM images are taken to validate defects after optical inspection. These high resolution SEM images catch not only optical inspection highlighted point, also its surrounding patterns. However, this pattern information is not well utilized in conventional quality control method. Using this complementary design based pattern monitor not only monitors and analyzes the variation of patterns sensitivity but also reduce nuisance and highlight defective patterns or killer defects. After grouping in either single or multiple layers, systematic defects can be identified quickly in this flow. In this paper, we applied design based pattern monitor in different layers to monitor process variation impacts on all kinds of patterns. First, the contour of high resolutions SEM image is extracted and aligned to design with offset adjustment and fine alignment [1]. Second, specified pattern rules can be applied on design clip area, the same size as SEM image, and form POI (pattern of interest) areas. Third, the discrepancy of contour and design measurement at different pattern types in measurement blocks. Fourth, defective patterns are reported by discrepancy detection criteria and pattern grouping [4]. Meanwhile, reported pattern defects are ranked by number and severity by discrepancy. In this step, process sensitive high repeatable systematic defects can be identified quickly Through this design based process pattern monitor method, most of optical inspection nuisances can be filtered out at contour to design discrepancy measurement. Daily analysis results are stored at database as reference to compare with incoming data. Defective pattern library contains existing and known systematic defect patterns which help to catch and identify new pattern defects or process impacts. On the other hand, this defect pattern library provides extra valuable information for mask, pattern and defects verification, inspection care area generation, further OPC fix and process enhancement and investigation.", "As critical dimensions for advanced two dimensional (2D) DUV patterning continue to shrink, the exact process window becomes increasingly difficult to determine. The defect size criteria shrink with the patterning critical dimensions and are well below the resolution of current optical inspection tools. As a result, it is more challenging for traditional bright field inspection tools to accurately discover the hotspots that define the process window. In this study, we use a novel computational inspection method to identify the depth-of-focus limiting features of a 10 nm node mask with 2D metal structures (single exposure) and compare the results to those obtained with a traditional process windows qualification (PWQ) method based on utilizing a focus modulated wafer and bright field inspection (BFI) to detect hotspot defects. The method is extended to litho-etch litho-etch (LELE) on a different test vehicle to show that overlay related bridging hotspots also can be identified.", "In the course of assessing OPC compact modeling capabilities and future requirements, we chose to investigate the interface between CD-SEM metrology methods and OPC modeling in some detail. Two linked observations motivated our study: 1) OPC modeling is, in principle, agnostic of metrology methods and best practice implementation. 2) Metrology teams across the industry use a wide variety of equipment, hardware settings, and image/data analysis methods to generate the large volumes of CD-SEM measurement data that are required for OPC in advanced technology nodes. Initial analyses led to the conclusion that many independent best practice metrology choices based on systematic study as well as accumulated institutional knowledge and experience can be reasonably made. Furthermore, these choices can result in substantial variations in measurement of otherwise identical model calibration and verification patterns. We will describe several experimental 2D test cases (i.e., metal, via/cut layers) that examine how systematic changes in metrology practice impact both the metrology data itself and the resulting full chip compact model behavior. Assessment of specific methodology choices will include: \u2022 CD-SEM hardware configurations and settings: these may range from SEM beam conditions (voltage, current, etc.,) to magnification, to frame integration optimizations that balance signal-to-noise vs. resist damage. \u2022 Image and measurement optimization: these may include choice of smoothing filters for noise suppression, threshold settings, etc. \u2022 Pattern measurement methodologies: these may include sampling strategies, CD- and contour- based approaches, and various strategies to optimize the measurement of complex 2D shapes. In addition, we will present conceptual frameworks and experimental methods that allow practitioners of OPC metrology to assess impacts of metrology best practice choices on model behavior. Finally, we will also assess requirements posed by node scaling on OPC model accuracy, and evaluate potential consequences for CD-SEM metrology capabilities and practices.", "Measurement of feature roughness is complicated by the confounding noise inherent in SEM images. Edge detection typically requires image filtering to be reliable, but such filtering inevitably alters the roughness that one is trying to measure. Thus, there is a need for an edge detection approach that reliably detects edges in very noisy SEM images without the use of image filtering. The analytical linescan model (ALM) accomplishes this goal by using a physical model for linescan generation to constrain the possible shape of a linescan. Inverting a calibrated model allows edge positions to be estimated with very low sensitivity to noise. The ALM was used to detect edges for the application of roughness measurements and shown to provide superior results compared to conventional methods that employ image filtering.", "We use the ZEISS MultiSEM to inspect patterns on separated chips of a semiconductor wafer suited for process window characterization at imec-N10 logic node. We systematically analyze the impact of imaging parameters of the MultiSEM on quantitative metrics extracted from the images, e.g., CD repeatability and relative defect capture, and demonstrate that the MultiSEM is able to image the wafer patterns, track their variations through the process conditions of the lithography scanner, and consistently find patterning defects limiting the lithographic process window.", "The introduction of finFET has contributed tremendously in making scaling beyond 20nm a reality. However, the complexity of these 3D high performance transistors generate inherent new defects that are difficult to detect and this heightens concerns over device quality and reliability at future technology nodes. New methods and approaches are thus needed to effectively detect and monitor this new class of defects. Color imaging in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is not a new phenomenon. However, its use in inline SEM based defect review in the semiconductor industry is relatively new. In this work SEM color imaging is used to enhance SEM review redetection of a buried defect, Gate to Source/Drain short in 14nm finFET device. Defect sites on the wafer are flagged as defect events by Bright Field (BF) defect inspection tools. The review tool uses SEM optics to redetect the defect event using a combination of very high electron landing energies in excess of 5 keV and high beam current of about 3,000 pA to confirm the existence of the defect. The defect signal is further processed through a color coder by the SEM review equipment to create a \u201cfalse\u201d color image to enhance defect redetection and help to accurately classify defect.", "Multi-channel gate all around (GAA) semiconductor devices march closer to becoming a reality in production as their maturity in development continues. From this development, an understanding of what physical parameters affecting the device has emerged. The importance of material property characterization relative to that of other physical parameters has continued to increase for GAA architecture when compared to its relative importance in earlier architectures. Among these materials properties are the concentration of Ge in SiGe channels and the strain in these channels and related films. But because these properties can be altered by many different process steps, each one adding its own variation to these parameters, their characterization and control at multiple steps in the process flow is crucial. This paper investigates the characterization of strain and Ge concentration, and the relationships between these properties, in the PFET SiGe channel material at the earliest stages of processing for GAA devices. Grown on a bulk Si substrate, multiple pairs of thin SiGe/Si layers that eventually form the basis of the PFET channel are measured and characterized in this study. Multiple measurement techniques are used to measure the material properties. In-line X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Low Energy X-Ray Fluorescence (LE-XRF) are used to characterize Ge content, while in-line High Resolution X-Ray Diffraction (HRXRD) is used to characterize strain. Because both patterned and un-patterned structures were investigated, scatterometry (also called optical critical dimension, or OCD) is used to provide valuable geometrical metrology.", "The focused ion beam (FIB) has become an important tool for micro- and nanostructuring of samples such as milling, deposition and imaging. However, this leads to damage of the surface on the nanometer scale from implanted projectile ions and recoiled material atoms. It is therefore important to investigate each kind of damage quantitatively. We present a dynamic Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation code to simulate the morphological and compositional changes of a multilayered sample under ion irradiation and a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation code to simulate dose-dependent changes in the backscattering-ion (BSI)/secondary-electron (SE) yields of a crystalline sample. Recent progress in the codes for research to simulate the surface morphology and Mo/Si layers intermixing in an EUV lithography mask irradiated with FIBs, and the crystalline orientation effect on BSI and SE yields relating to the channeling contrast in scanning ion microscopes, is also presented.", "New critical dimension metrology methods such as critical dimension small angle X-ray scattering (CDSAXS) are being developed to meet the measurement challenges of next generation devices. Two key requirements for any new CD metrology method are non-destructiveness and the measurement speed. We will report on a study of beam damage and scattering strength of two model photoresist systems, HSQ and PMMA. We also will report on the status and initial results from NIST\u2019s upgraded lab CDSAXS system. 50 nm pitch line gratings were fabricated in HSQ and PMMA films using EUV interference lithography at the Swiss Light Source. The lines were about 30 nm tall and 20-30 nm wide. The 17 keV CDSAXS exposure time was varied from 0.1 s to 60 s to determine the minimum X-ray exposure required to obtain a satisfactory fit. Normal incident measurements separated by a blanket X-ray exposure were repeated to measure the decrease in scattering intensity with X-ray dose. The PMMA scattering signal was found to decrease by about 80 % before stabilizing at around 15 % of the original scattering intensity. The HSQ scattering signal decreased much less and stabilized at about 80 % of the original scattering intensity. We also conducted a series of variable-angle CDSAXS measurements as a function of blanket X-ray exposure to determine how the shape of the photoresist lines changed during X-ray exposure. For PMMA, we found the line width to remain constant and the line height to decrease from 25 nm to 10 nm during the exposure series. The exposures that damaged the samples corresponded to several hours of exposure to the synchrotron beam in a 100 \u00b5m spot and were much longer than what was required to characterize the line gratings. Smaller targets result in a larger dose and could potentially damage the resist in the time required to make a CDSAXS measurement. The large differences in beam damage between PMMA and HSQ show that resist damage from CDSAXS will depend on the particular resist chemistries and target size.", "Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is one alternative lithography solution that is being pursued by the industry. A metrology-related problem specific to NIL is the measurement of the residual layer thickness (RLT), as knowledge of this is key to the monitoring and control of the NIL process and subsequent patterning. Scatterometry is used to measure the RLT due to its ability to measure profile features non-destructively with high throughput. But because scatterometry is sensitive to features unrelated to the parameter of interest, complex geometries throughout the film stack can make the measurement challenging. New methods to reduce the impact of such complex geometries on the measurement parameters of interest are therefore needed. Because of the use of NIL for 3DNAND development, the measurement of the RLT with complex structures underneath becomes necessary. This paper describes the results from a new hybrid metrology method that can combine key information from these complex geometries with scatterometry measurements to reduce the impact on the RLT measurement due to the layers beneath the resist. By reducing this impact, scatterometry measurement noise and cross-correlation of parameters are reduced, resulting in better precision and accuracy in the RLT measurement.", "Analysis of hotspots is becoming more and more critical as we scale from node to node. To define true process windows at sub-14 nm technology nodes, often defect inspections are being included to weed out design weak spots (often referred to as hotspots). Defect inspection sub 28 nm nodes is a two pass process. Defect locations identified by optical inspection tools need to be reviewed by review-SEM\u2019s to understand exactly which feature is failing in the region flagged by the optical tool. The images grabbed by the review-SEM tool are used for classification but rarely for quantification. The goal of this paper is to see if the thousands of review-SEM images which are existing can be used for quantification and further analysis. More specifically we address the SEM quantification problem with connected component analysis.", "The semiconductor industry has continually sought the approaches to produce memory devices with increased memory cells per memory die. One way to meet the increasing storage capacity demand and reduce bit cost of NAND flash memories is 3D stacked flash cell array. In constructing 3D NAND flash memories, increasing the number of stacked layers to build more memory cell number per unit area necessitates many high-aspect-ratio etching processes accordingly the incorporation of thick and unique etching hard-mask scheme has been indispensable. However, the ever increasingly thick requirement on etching hard-mask has made the hard-mask film stress control extremely important for maintaining good process qualities. The residual film stress alters the wafer shape consequently several process impacts have been readily observed across wafer, such as wafer chucking error on scanner, film peeling, materials coating and baking defects, critical dimension (CD) non-uniformity and overlay degradation. This work investigates the overlay and residual order performance indicator (ROPI) degradation coupling with increasingly thick advanced patterning film (APF) etching hard-mask. Various APF films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method under different deposition temperatures, chemicals combinations, radio frequency powers and chamber pressures were carried out. And -342MPa to +80MPa film stress with different film thicknesses were generated for the overlay performance study. The results revealed the overlay degradation doesn\u2019t directly correlate with convex or concave wafer shapes but the magnitude of residual APF film stress, while increasing the APF thickness will worsen the overlay performance and ROPI strongly. High-stress APF film was also observed to enhance the scanner chucking difference and lead to more serious wafer to wafer overlay variation. To reduce the overlay degradation from ever increasingly thick APF etching hard-mask, optimizing the film stress of APF is the most effective way and high order overlay compensation is also helpful.", "With the integration of high speed Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) based Automated Defect Redetection (ADR) in both high volume semiconductor manufacturing and Research and Development (R and D), the need for reliable SEM Automated Defect Classification (ADC) has grown tremendously in the past few years. In many high volume manufacturing facilities and R and D operations, defect inspection is performed on EBeam (EB), Bright Field (BF) or Dark Field (DF) defect inspection equipment. A comma separated value (CSV) file is created by both the patterned and non-patterned defect inspection tools. The defect inspection result file contains a list of the inspection anomalies detected during the inspection tools\u2019 examination of each structure, or the examination of an entire wafers surface for non-patterned applications. This file is imported into the Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscope (DRSEM). Following the defect inspection result file import, the DRSEM automatically moves the wafer to each defect coordinate and performs ADR. During ADR the DRSEM operates in a reference mode, capturing a SEM image at the exact position of the anomalies coordinates and capturing a SEM image of a reference location in the center of the wafer. A Defect reference image is created based on the Reference image minus the Defect image. The exact coordinates of the defect is calculated based on the calculated defect position and the anomalies stage coordinate calculated when the high magnification SEM defect image is captured. The captured SEM image is processed through either DRSEM ADC binning, exporting to a Yield Analysis System (YAS), or a combination of both. Process Engineers, Yield Analysis Engineers or Failure Analysis Engineers will manually review the captured images to insure that either the YAS defect binning is accurately classifying the defects or that the DRSEM defect binning is accurately classifying the defects. This paper is an exploration of the feasibility of the utilization of a Hitachi RS4000 Defect Review SEM to perform Automatic Defect Classification with the objective of the total automated classification accuracy being greater than human based defect classification binning when the defects do not require multiple process step knowledge for accurate classification. The implementation of DRSEM ADC has the potential to improve the response time between defect detection and defect classification. Faster defect classification will allow for rapid response to yield anomalies that will ultimately reduce the wafer and/or the die yield.", "In recent years, lithographic printability of overlay metrology targets for memory applications has emerged as a significant issue. Lithographic illumination conditions such as extreme dipole, required to achieve the tightest possible pitches in DRAM pose a significant process window challenge to the metrology target design. Furthermore, the design is also required to track scanner aberration induced pattern placement errors of the device structure. Previous workiii, has shown that the above requirements have driven a design optimization methodology which needs to be tailored for every lithographic and integration scheme, in particular self-aligned double and quadruple patterning methods. In this publication we will report on the results of a new target design technique and show some example target structures which, while achieving the requirements specified above, address a further critical design criterion \u2013 that of process resilience.", "Overlay control for semiconductor devices is getting tighter in recent years. In the past, we may only concern the whether the overlay are in spec or not. However, the spec we concerned was the same for both X and Y directions. To achieve the tighter spec in the future, we may consider the asymmetry specs for X and Y directions separately for some specific layers, such as CONT layer. For example, if the spec of X direction is tighter than Y direction, we can lose the precision of overlay from Y direction to let overlay from X direction more precise. Theoretically, the common overlay models such as HOPC or iHOPC set X and Y directions independently. To reach the goal of loss overly from one direction to preserve the overlay from the other direction, we consider the full map measurement overlay historical data. From these data, we can analyze the data to find which overlay targets are more important to X direction, and we can set these corresponding targets as the new measurement locations. This is one concept of \u201casymmetry\u201d since the chosen measurement locations can provide more precisely correction for the overlay of specific direction. On the other hand, we use the in spec ratio (ISR) index for all measurement overlay targets on wafer to replace the traditional mean plus 3 sigma (M3S) index, since we have the budgets of both X and Y directions. The in spec ratio is defined as ratio that the residuals of X and Y directions fill the corresponding budgets, simultaneously. Since our goal is to maximize the ISR, the traditional M3S optimization algorithm can be replaced by ISR optimization with different overlay specs. That is the reason we call \u201casymmetry overlay correction\u201d.", "The semiconductor industry current standard of focus setup and control can be improved by the implementation of diffraction-based focus (DBF) marks and their applications. Determining best focus per scanner/reticle/device/layer (SRDL) combination is currently done by exposing a focus/energy matrix (FEM) wafer and examining CD features. The drawback of this process of record (POR) method is that the accuracy is greatly influenced by inter- and intra-field effects, focus step size, and machine accuracy. However, DBF marks do not suffer from these drawbacks because they are measured on product and close to the CD features. Experiments confirm that when comparing Bossung curves on each scanner, the wafer-to-wafer variation is much lower using DBF. The setup time and accuracy of new SRDL combinations can also be greatly improved using DBF. DBF uses an asymmetry signal which is translated directly to focus values and is independent of any focus settings of the scanner. After accurately determining the best focus using DBF on only one SRDL combination, the focus setting can be applied to all other combinations and scanners will be matched. Instead of exposing a FEM for each SRDL combination, best focus only needs to be determined once. Experiments using five different machine/reticle combinations show that Bossung tops can be matched with significantly more accuracy compared to POR. Experiments also show a linear relation between energy and shift in Bossung top; both DBF and CD are sensitive to energy variation. When correcting for energy differences, the Bossung top scanner-to-scanner matching accuracy can be improved further. A method using DBF for scanner best focus matching saves up to 10 hours of CD-SEM and manpower setup time per SRDL combination. When a scanner needs to be requalified, the same DBF focus setup method can be used, reducing the scanner downtime.", "This study explores the feasibility of utilizing the high throughput non-destructive inspection by Surface Scanning Inspection System (SSIS) of copper wafers to monitor the quality of the copper seeding and electroplating process. Currently copper grain size and surface quality is measured by atomic force microscope (AFM). While AFM provides high resolution information down to 1 um2 it is highly time intensive inspection of a single wafer taking up to 20 minutes. The SSIS in this study provides fast full wafer surface roughness information in 450um \u00d7 450um blocks. This paper will also investigate the advantages of identifying wafer level process variation of the copper film deposition with the SSIS versus sampled points of AFM inspection. With full wafer surface roughness information it may be possible to find a commonality between the quality of the copper electroplating process based up on the haze information of the copper seeding wafer.", "On-product overlay requirements are becoming more challenging with every next technology node due to the continued decrease of the device dimensions and process tolerances. Therefore, current and future technology nodes require demanding metrology capabilities such as target designs that are robust towards process variations and high overlay measurement density (e.g. for higher order process corrections) to enable advanced process control solutions. The impact of advanced control solutions based on YieldStar overlay data is being presented in this paper. Multi patterning techniques are applied for critical layers and leading to additional overlay measurement demands. The use of 1D process steps results in the need of overlay measurements relative to more than one layer. Dealing with the increased number of overlay measurements while keeping the high measurement density and metrology accuracy at the same time presents a challenge for high volume manufacturing (HVM). These challenges are addressed by the capability to measure multi-layer targets with the recently introduced YieldStar metrology tool, YS350. On-product overlay results of such multi-layers and standard targets are presented including measurement stability performance.", "During the last few decades, the semiconductor industry has been able to scale device performance up while driving costs down. What started off as simple geometrical scaling, driven mostly by advances in lithography, has recently been accompanied by advances in processing techniques and in device architectures. The trend to combine efforts using process technology and lithography is expected to intensify, as further scaling becomes ever more difficult. One promising component of future nodes are \u201cscaling boosters\u201d, i.e. processing techniques that enable further scaling. An indispensable component in developing these ever more complex processing techniques is semiconductor process modeling software. Visualization of complex 3D structures in SEMulator3D, along with budget analysis on film thicknesses, CD and etch budgets, allow process integrators to compare flows before any physical wafers are run. Hundreds of \u201cvirtual\u201d wafers allow comparison of different processing approaches, along with EUV or DUV patterning options for defined layers and different overlay schemes. This \u201cvirtual fabrication\u201d technology produces massively parallel process variation studies that would be highly time-consuming or expensive in experiment. Here, we focus on one particular scaling booster, the fully self-aligned via (FSAV). We compare metal-via-metal (mevia-me) chains with self-aligned and fully-self-aligned via\u2019s using a calibrated model for imec\u2019s N7 BEoL flow. To model overall variability, 3D Monte Carlo modeling of as many variability sources as possible is critical. We use Coventor SEMulator3D to extract minimum me-me distances and contact areas and show how fully self-aligned vias allow a better me-via distance control and tighter via-me contact area variability compared with the standard self-aligned via (SAV) approach.", "Continuous tightening of the overlay control budget in the semiconductor industry drives the need for improved overlay metrology capabilities. In this context, measurement accuracy needs to be addressed. The first part this study shows that Diffraction Based Overlay metrology accuracy can be improved with a dedicated methodology. This methodology involves the use of target design simulation software in order to maximize stack sensitivity and to minimize processes non uniformity impact on the measurement. In the second part this study focuses on Holistic Metrology Qualification (HMQ) methodology that allows selecting the best on-wafer target. The methodology is explained and discussed. It is demonstrated that HMQ helps to reduce target asymmetry impact on measurement uncertainty and to select primary recipe parameters (wavelength, polarization, etc\u2026). Finally CD-SEM measurements were used to validate methodology results.", "ASML AH53 and AH74 with higher odd-order diffraction light are the widely used alignment marks in industry to achieve better alignment accuracy by reducing mark damage noise. During lithography alignment process, decent diffraction light power is the basic demand. However, with the use of some high absorption (k is not equal to 0 for detective wavelength) material, it is difficult to detect the light power reflecting from the thick and opaque film stacks with these standard alignment marks. Here we optimized four alignment marks with higher odd-order diffraction power with comparing with AH53 and AH74. One software based on Fourier optical theory is built to quickly calculate the wafer quality (WQ) of different film stacks and different alignment marks. ASML SMASH alignment system can accept customized alignment mark, with new mark type configuration file. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of new alignment marks, we put the marks on a mask and do the experiments to compare with simulation results. All the experiments results show that new designed alignment marks have larger WQs of odd-order diffraction.", "Optical metrology tool, LX530, is designed for high throughput and dense sampling metrology in semiconductor manufacture. It can inspect the dose and focus variation in the process control based on the critical dimension (CD) and line edge roughness (LER) measurement. The working principle is shown with a finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) CD simulation. Two optical post lithography wafers, including one focus-exposure-matrix (FEM) wafer and one nominal wafer, are inspected for CD, dose and focus analysis. It is demonstrated that dose and focus can be measured independently. A data output method based on global CD uniformity (CDU), inter CDU and intra CDU is proposed to avoid the data volume issue in dense sampling whole wafer inspection.", "In the advent of multiple patterning techniques in semiconductor industry, metrology has progressively become a burden. With multiple patterning techniques such as Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch and Sidewall Assisted Double Patterning, the number of processing step have increased significantly and therefore, so as the amount of metrology steps needed for both control and yield monitoring. The amount of metrology needed is increasing in each and every node as more layers needed multiple patterning steps, and more patterning steps per layer. In addition to this, there is that need for guided defect inspection, which in itself requires substantially denser focus, overlay, and CD metrology as before. Metrology efficiency will therefore be cruicial to the next semiconductor nodes. ASML's emulated wafer concept offers a highly efficient method for hybrid metrology for focus, CD, and overlay. In this concept metrology is combined with scanner's sensor data in order to predict the on-product performance. The principle underlying the method is to isolate and estimate individual root-causes which are then combined to compute the on-product performance. The goal is to use all the information available to avoid ever increasing amounts of metrology.", "Overlay metrology setup today faces a continuously changing landscape of process steps. During Diffraction Based Overlay (DBO) metrology setup, many different metrology target designs are evaluated in order to cover the full process window. The standard method for overlay metrology setup consists of single-wafer optimization in which the performance of all available metrology targets is evaluated. Without the availability of external reference data or multiwafer measurements it is hard to predict the metrology accuracy and robustness against process variations which naturally occur from wafer-to-wafer and lot-to-lot. In this paper, the capabilities of the Holistic Metrology Qualification (HMQ) setup flow are outlined, in particular with respect to overlay metrology accuracy and process robustness. The significance of robustness and its impact on overlay measurements is discussed using multiple examples. Measurement differences caused by slight stack variations across the target area, called grating imbalance, are shown to cause significant errors in the overlay calculation in case the recipe and target have not been selected properly. To this point, an overlay sensitivity check on perturbations of the measurement stack is presented for improvement of the overlay metrology setup flow. An extensive analysis on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from HMQ recipe optimization is performed on \u00b5DBO measurements of product wafers. The key parameters describing the sensitivity to perturbations of the measurement stack are based on an intra-target analysis. Using advanced image analysis, which is only possible for image plane detection of \u03bcDBO instead of pupil plane detection of DBO, the process robustness performance of a recipe can be determined. Intra-target analysis can be applied for a wide range of applications, independent of layers and devices.", "To produce high-end semiconductor products, clean vacuum is often required. Even small amounts of high-mass molecules can reduce product yield. The challenge is to timely detect the presence of relevant contaminants. This is where MFIG can help. The mass-filtered ion gauge sensor (MFIG) continuously and selectively monitors the presence of high-mass contaminant molecules with a sensitivity down to 1E-13 mbar at total pressures up to 1E-5 mbar. This contribution presents laboratory and field-test data to demonstrate the capabilities of the latest version of the MFIG sensor in continuously and selectively detecting high-mass contaminant molecules in (U)HV vacuum."], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
