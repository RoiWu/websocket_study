This is a particular boon for processes with limited exposure latitudes such as High-NA EUV lithography. Creating and employing first-principle models of MOx lithographic processes should speed adoption and development of these materials and represents an important aspect of platform maturation. Stochastic photochemical models of metalcontaining resist systems have previously been developed, but without extension to computational lithography. Likewise, stochastic models derived from CAR systems have been fit to MOx lithographic data using computational lithography software, facilitating limited stochastic lithography studies without capturing fundamental MOx imaging processes. Recently, a rigorous stochastic model built from the ground up using MOx-specific resist principles has been developed. In this contribution, the performance of this MOx-specific model was assessed by comparing simulated and experimental lithography data for a series of MOx resists under a range of exposure and process conditions. Chemical and physical properties of the resists derived independently from X-ray diffraction, EUV absorbance, FTIR spectroscopy, and ellipsometry measurements were parameterized in the context of the simulation, and calibration routines were used to fit simulated data to experimental CD-SEM exposure data produced using an NXE-3300B EUV scanner. Insights from these models may be used to guide MOx resist development and EUV lithography process optimization. Ultimately, these studies will help to identify process windows, processing points, and possibly improvements to the MOx resists.", "Stochastic defects are becoming major concern in the future EUV lithography as their probability Pd exponentially increases with decreasing feature size and is highly sensitive to variations in process/mask conditions. Photon shot noises and discrete/probabilistic nature of materials have been blamed as their causes. We introduce models for relating Pd to photon and resist statistics under various exposure and material conditions and analyze their impact in future EUV lithography. Three-dimensional reaction distributions are calculated by a fully-coupled Monte Carlo simulation including discrete photon, photoelectron scattering, and resist stochastics. Then, probability models predict Pd from statistical data extracted from Monte Carlo results. Stochastic defect generation is enhanced by cascade and/or cluster of correlated reactions among nearby polymers/molecules due to secondary electrons (SE)/acid diffusion and SEs generated along scattered photoelectron trajectories. Pd decreases with increasing reaction density, suppressing effective image blur, and introducing quenchers, where reaction density is limited by SE, PAG and reaction site. Defect probability increases with decreasing target size for the same k1-factor, while strongly dependent on image slope and defocus. Our analyses suggest that applying EUV lithography to smaller target requires careful material choice, extremely precise process control, and further EUV power enhancement.", "Despite years of research and development, the fundamental processes of photoionization, secondary electron generation, recombination, diffusion, and resist switching are poorly understood at the atomic level for EUVL. Multiscale modeling of these physical and chemical processes can provide answers to questions that are difficult or impossible to answer with experiment alone. A modeling pipeline that includes Monte Carlo modeling of photon- and electron-matter interactions, along with density functional theory calculations of chemical switching will be introduced in this proceeding. The Hf4O2(OMc)12 nanocluster resist will be presented as a case study. Photon and secondary electron yields, electron energy and spatial distributions, and a quantum chemical pathway for negative tone switching will be presented. Fundamental learning from studies like this can be used to improve resist design including improving contrast of these materials.", "In this paper we will first review the metrology for detecting stochastic printing failures (or defects): which techniques are available and what is their performance in detecting the different failure types in regular L/S or contact arrays, in terms of sensitivity and wafer area they can cover. Although progress is being made, metrology is still a concern: not all types of failures can be detected with the sensitivity and area-inspection capability that will eventually be required for yield sign-off. Next, we look into the progress we have been making in generating empirical correlators (or predictors) that can reproduce observed dependencies of the position of the stochastic cliffs on patterning or structure parameters, such as focus-dose, illumination mode, mask bias and pitch. In this part we focus on the microbridge-cliff on resist wafers, with some initial data on the missing-contact cliff. Especially the pitch-dependency (proximity dependency) of the cliff position is a challenge, as good models for this dependency are crucial for the development of stochastic-hotspot predictors for the OPC Verification flow. In this paper we will present for the first time a reasonable predictor for this pitch dependency; but although these results a promising step forward, they are not yet good enough as a final solution. So, this type of research will need to be continued.", "Stochastic defects are a concern in the lithographic processes used for semiconductor manufacturing, particularly for advanced node extreme ultraviolet lithographic processes. Experimentally determining the defect probability for a lithographic process is extremely time-consuming, requiring expensive metrology equipment and generally limited to simple patterns. Defect probability simulations can be beneficial from time and cost perspective and furthermore should be extensible to more complex patterns. As such, being able to accurately predict the defect probability using lithography simulations would be a valuable complementary option. We show the results of a fast simulation-based methodology for predicting defect probabilities based on a continuum lithographic model calibrated to experimental data. The simulation based-results are compared to experimental microbridge defect probability data where we show a good correlation between the two.", "The methods to calculate the probability of success/failure of EUV lithography (EUVL) processes are presented. The success of an EUVL process is defined as a complete removal of the resist material within one set of designated volumes and a complete retention of the resist material within another set of designated volumes in the resist film. We demonstrate that, under certain assumptions, the probability calculation reduces to the well-known problem of calculation of probability of excursion of a certain Gaussian random field. The methods to calculate the probability of success/failure of a lithographic process are presented, including the Monte-Carlo methods, methods based on factorization of a covariance matrix, methods based on Mahalanobis distance, and the methods using Rice\u2019s formula and its variations. A particular attention is paid to the methods applicable to full chip OPC and OPC verification. The results from the proposed methods are tested in simulations and by comparison with experimental data.", "Extending extreme ultraviolet (EUV) single exposure patterning to its limits is dependent on eliminating its stochastic defectivity. Along with developments in photoresist platforms, the patterning film stack also needs to be considered. The material immediately underneath the photoresist is expected to have significant impact on both lithographic and pattern transfer performance. By designing the resist substrate interface with high EUV absorbance, there is potential to increase the EUV quantum yield of the exposure process. Increasing the selectivity to organic layer offers the opportunity to modulate stochastic defects through etch strategies. This paper will demonstrate the patterning of various chemically amplified resists on a high-Z metal-based hardmask. The potential for dose reduction, higher etch selectivity, and defectivity improvement from a high-Z hardmask will be discussed. Deposition-trim etch techniques will be used for decreasing the transfer of stochastic defects to the underlying substrate. Sub-32nm pitch trench patterning, defectivity, and electrical yield for this patterning stack will be highlighted.", "With aggressive scaling of single-expose EUV lithography to the sub-7 nm node, stochastic variations play a prominent role in defining the lithographic process window. Fluctuations in photon shot noise, absorption and subsequent chemical reactions can lead to stochastic failure, directly impacting electrical yield. Fundamental characterization of the mode and magnitude of these variations is required to define the threshold for failure. In this work, a complementary series of techniques is enlisted to probe the nature and modulation of stochastic variation in single exposure EUV patterning. Unbiased line edge roughness (LER), local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) and defect inspection techniques are employed to monitor the frequency of stochastic variations leading to failures in line/space and via patterning. Using this methodology, we explore the modulation of stochastic variations by different photoresists and illuminations, with emphasis on material and process down-selection for improved yield at the sub-7 nm node.", "The effective dose delivered by an EUV lithography cluster is composite function of the dose provided by the scanner EUV radiation source and illuminator, the reflectance of the EUV mask, the transmission of the scanner projection optics and the PEB conditions experienced by the EUV sensitive imaging resist. Open frame test wafer exposures and the sub-E0 analysis technique described at SPIE2018 have been adopted to characterize and monitor the impact of the factors above on the effective dose stability and uniformity. Wafer exposure sequences and layouts, and the details of the analysis methodology were customized to study adverse dose factors in each of the areas described above.", "Mask technology is key to enabling the progression of advanced IC technology nodes into the realm beyond 7nm node logic. In particular, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) relies heavily on the mask in order to achieve adequate process window (PW) and final yields. In the EUVL environment, mask process development and verification becomes increasingly more difficult and costly. The mask manufacture costs are driven by multiple factors including significantly more expensive mask blanks and increased ebeam write times. Wafer verification of mask process improvements is very difficult with the relatively low number of early adopters of EUVL and high cost associated with processing non-product wafers with that technology. It is therefore useful for mask manufacturers and wafer lithographers to collaborate to develop low cost mask process screening techniques as a precursor to committing valuable EUV exposure time for final verification. Previously, we demonstrated that by utilizing a toolkit of mask and wafer analytical techniques known as advanced mask characterization and optimization (AMCO) [2], we were able to predict wafer defectivity on 1D and 2D metal structures and optimize a mask process to enable 30nm pitch interconnect in a single exposure step using EUVL [1]. In this study, we use similar methodology to develop a mask process for beyond 7nm node logic contact and via layers. These structures pose a different set of challenges than the metal layer. Contact hole area loss, corner rounding (CR), and mask process-induced x-y error on asymmetric holes must be optimized to deliver the required capability. Additionally, sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) become relevant at this node. Resolving these on the mask is critical. Here, we describe the development of a mask process to overcome these challenges. We use advanced modeling techniques including AMCO to characterize the process improvements and predict wafer performance. Mask process improvements that are characterized include both physical mask process components as well as write data optimization techniques, i.e. mask process correction (MPC).", "Sustaining optimum EUV litho-cluster performance requires monitoring the dimensional variance of representative patterns at high speed and sampling density. We present NXE3400 monitoring results obtained with an optical technique whose amplified sensitivity to dimensional variance increases with decreasing pitch. The scalable technique enables quantitative tracking of site-to-site pattern profile and fidelity and it is applied here on 5nm-node-relevant EUV dense features (line/space width, line/space ends in elongated contact holes). We benchmark against conventional monitoring methods to demonstrate capability improvements. We finally introduce complementary methods which enable a robust manufacturing insertion of EUV technology; such as 2-dimensional feature monitoring and stochastic defect prediction.", "In this paper we show experimental verification of the feasibility of printing pitch 40x70nm hexagonal holes using EUV single patterning. We show that at a local CDU (LCDU) of 2.7nm and an exposure dose of 54 mJ/cm2 a defect rate smaller than 7x10-9 is observed. This result was enabled by optimization of the illumination source and improvements in the resist. Resist selection identified multiple candidates that show a promising LCDU performance and optimization of the processing conditions resulted in improved performance. Experimental validation of the defect performance was done using HMI eP5 on the baseline process. Assessment of the LCDU performance for EUV single expose at pitches beyond 40x70nm, showed promising results.", "As future patterning processes reach the limit of lithographic printability, continuous innovation in mandrel trim or shrink strategies are required to reach sub-20 nm line-space patterning. Growing concerns of lithography defectivity, mask selectivity, line edge roughness (LER), line width roughness (LWR), and critical dimension uniformity (CDU) present significant challenges towards this goal. The authors compare various alternative mandrel trim strategies to highlight potential solutions and drawbacks towards enabling successful printing of mandrels used in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) multi-patterning schemes. Through this comparison, the authors demonstrate the challenges of maintaining adequate pattern transferability while keeping aspect ratio-driven line roughness and material selectivity under control. By process partitioning, the limitations of traditional lithography and etch trimming strategies are highlighted, suggesting the need for new methods of CD reduction after the pattern has been transferred. These new trimming methods offer flexibility in CD control without negatively impacting the mandrel profile and demonstrates better tunability across different material sets, allowing for evaluation of different mask and mandrel material combinations for downstream process optimization.", "Multiple ASML\u2019s NXE:3400B scanners are installed at the factories and slated to go to a high volume manufacturing (HVM) phase. The latest generation of the scanners NXE:3400C has an improved performance and availability also due to availability improvement of the EUV sources by implementing modularity concept. In this paper, we provide an overview of a tin laser-produced-plasma (LPP) extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) sources at 13.5nm enabling HVM at the N7 node and beyond. The field performance of the source at 250 watts power including the performance of subsystems such as the Collector and the Droplet Generator will be shown. Progress in the development of key technologies for power scaling towards 500W will be described.", "Gigaphoton develops CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source which is the most promising solution as the 13.5nm high power light source for HVM EUVL. Unique and original technologies including; combination of pulsed CO2 laser and Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser pulses for shooting and debris mitigation by magnetic field have been applied. We have developed first practical source for HVM; \u201cGL200E\u201d in 2014. Then it is demonstrated which high average power CO2 laser more than 20kW at output power in cooperation with Mitsubishi Electri. Pilot#1 is up running and it demonstrates HVM capability; EUV power recorded at 111W on average (117W in burst stabilized, 95% duty) with 5% conversion efficiency for 22 hour operation in October 2016. Availability is achievable at 89% (2 weeks average), also superior magnetic mitigation has demonstrated promising mirror degradation rate (= 0.5%/Gp) at 100W or higher power operation with dummy mirror test. We have demonstrated actual collector mirror reflectivity degradation rate is less than 0.4%/Gp by using real collector mirror around 125W (at I/F clean) in burst power during 30 Billion pulses operation. Recently we have redefined target power higher >330W and its development plan. Also we will update latest challenges for >330W average operation with actual collector mirror at the conference.", "With the introduction of the NXE:3400B scanner, ASML has brought EUV to High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM). In this context, ASML is pursuing a dual-path approach towards zero reticle defectivity: EUVcompatible pellicle or zero particles towards reticle by advanced particle contamination control. This paper will focus primarily on the approach of advanced particle contamination control and on the understanding of EUV-induced plasma to control both release and transport of particles within the scanner. This paper will present our advancements in understanding and control of particle forces related to the EUV-induced plasma, for EUV sources up to 250W and beyond. This will combine models and simulations with off-line experiments as well as in-situ scanner tests. It will be shown that our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of plasma-induced release and transport of <1um particles enables us to manage defectivity levels down to be compatible with HVM requirements for sub-10nm node lithography.", "With the persistent drive to enable EUV lithography (EUVL) for the continuation of pattern scaling and the close collaborations between suppliers and customers, tremendous progress has been made in the last five years in EUV mask infrastructure development. With the advent of actinic pattern mask inspection (APMI) tool, the only remaining EUV mask infrastructure gap until recently has been closed. We will present real-case examples from inspection of 7nm and 5nm logic node EUV masks with APMI in operation at Intel mask shop and demonstrate that actinic inspection provides defect detection capability beyond the traditional DUV optical and e-beam mask inspection (EBMI) tools for defect control and the guaranty of mask quality. In addition to the main focus on APMI and through-pellicle inspection in this paper, we also provide a brief discussion of other key EUV infrastructure modules for mask production in current EUVL at 0.33NA and future technology extension to enable high NA EUVL at 0.55NA.", "Toward logic 3nm node and beyond, alternative absorber material is required to reduce mask 3D effect. One of the promising candidates is attenuated phase shirt type absorber which is effective for specific pattern shape such as contact hole. We developed novel high reflective phase shift type absorber. In this paper, we will report the blank and mask properties for this high reflective phase shift type absorber material.", "Ni is a promising candidate for future EUV absorber material due to its superior optical properties. However existing reports on gas phase patterning of Ni are limited and not precise enough to support the application. In this work, we present a two-step reaction ion etch (RIE) and atomic layer etching (ALE) process, in which the a cyclic exposure to chlorine and hydrogen plasmas in the RIE stage removes the bulk of the majority of the exposed Ni thin films, and a cyclic exposure to oxygen plasma and gas phase formic acid tailors the surface chemical contrast to form a directional etching profile. In the ALE step, the final sidewall angle is defined by directional ions that simultaneously control the subsequent etching selectivity and anisotropy. Specifically, the oxygen plasma exposure converts the surface to an oxide layer which has a large chemical reactivity contrast to the organic acid, therefore the reaction self-terminates upon the complete removal of the oxides, leaving an exposed metallic surface on the sidewall with great verticality. The self-limiting nature of this process is backed by the removal rate difference of over 100:1 between etching NiO x and Ni using formic acid vapor. The effect of acid exposure pressure is studied, and a higher pressure results in a more vertical sidewall profile. Structures of post-etch patterns were measured using AFM, SEM and TEM while the chemical compositions are confirmed by XPS and EDS. This approach is free of noble ion bombardment \u2013 greatly reducing adventitious sputtering \u2013 and has a much more forgiving process windows comparing to other reported approaches. A final sidewall angle of 87 has been observed for the first time using this highly selective self-limiting technique, which can be further improved with process optimization.", "Industry has made significant progress advancing EUVL technology the past several years leading to its full adoption for N7 node production. To extend EUVL technology well into 3nm node and beyond, a new high-NA EUV platform is needed. These new EUVL scanner platforms plan to use anamorphic optics with 0.55NA, which introduces several additional mask related imaging complications. Current scanners have light incidence of 6\u00b0, while the new 0.55NA systems will use < 6\u00b0 incidence. At mask level, the combination of EUV light at oblique incidence, absorber thickness, and non-uniform mirror reflectance through incidence angle, creates mask-induced imaging aberrations, known as mask 3D effects (M3D). Additionally, these high NA systems will have non-telecentricity, which has shown to cause H-V bias due to shadowing, pattern shift through focus, and image contrast loss due to apodization by the reflective mask coatings. All these factors point to the need of thinner EUV mask absorber, which will dramatically reduce these effects. A possible mitigation for the M3D effects is to use mask absorber materials with high extinction coefficient \u03ba and refractive coefficient n close to unity. Current EUV masks use Ta-based absorber on top of MoSi reflective multilayer. Multiple studies have shown that optical constants for the 60nm Ta-based absorber thickness at EUV wavelength do not provide optimal wafer imaging for high NA platforms. Alternative absorbers with higher absorptivity than Ta, such as Ni, Co among others have been proposed and, from simulation work, have shown improved high NA imaging at < 40nm thickness. The replacement of Ta-based absorber by new alternative material is an arduous task for the mask industry. The new absorber material must not only meet improved imaging criteria, but it must also meet required material properties which makes its compatibility with different aspects of mask blank and mask manufacturing process very critical. In this work, we have embarked on alternative thin absorber material evaluation and characterization studies to find and assess viability of new absorber material, which best meets EUV mask fabrication requirements for impending N3 and below advanced semiconductor device nodes. While number of high-k materials were considered and evaluated, material selection narrowed our focus on one unique composite material, which met our critical requirements of low EUV reflectivity, fast etching rate and high cleaning durability. Material evaluation consisted of studying mask process modules from absorber etch, ebeam patterning capability, post-exposure processing and cleaning, defect Inspection, and finally EUV wafer printability. In these studies, we also evaluated this new material for critical mask patterning performance looking at key metrics such as resolution, CD linearity, proximity, control (targeting and uniformity), and LER/LWR. We also characterized pattern fidelity looking at complex mask designs for 5nm node and beyond using internally developed advanced mask characterization methodology emphasizing 2D pattern characterization including sidewall angle (SWA) assessment of patterned absorber.", "As extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology progresses towards and below sub-7nm generations, polarization effects will begin to have an impact. Moving to higher NA will introduce polarization effects at all locations: the mask plane, the optics, and the image plane. Contrast losses at a larger angle can occur from the interference at the image plane that will become significant for smaller geometries approaching the EUVL wavelength. Some of these contrast losses can occur at the mask where the polarized reflectance from an EUV mask is affected by the multilayer reflective stack and patterned features. This paper explores the polarization effects that are induced by EUVL masks for sub-7nm lithography. The results show a polarization-dependent induction and attenuation of current in EUVL mask structures, especially as mask pitch decreases below 6\u03bb.", "We present a comparison of experimental techniques for measuring the as-built phase shift of EUV photomasks to meet the unique requirements for EUV lithography at the resolution limit. Attenuated phase-shift masks provide superior image quality for certain applications such as low-k1 contact and pillar arrays, offering increased throughput and reduced stochastic printing failures. But whereas the traditional phase-shift is \u03c0, rigorous electromagnetic simulations suggest the optimal phase-shift for an EUV photomask must be adjusted to account for Mask 3D effects, which are themselves difficult to measure. In this work, we explore at-wavelength metrology including reflectometry, scatterometry, and phase imaging for measuring multilayer and absorber reflectance, as well as complex scattering amplitudes for a grating with pitch p = 420nm and duty-cycle D = 0.33. Using rigorous electromagnetic simulations, we find that relying only on reflectometery and the Fresnel thin-mask model predicts the complex scattering amplitudes with 22% accuracy due to 3D effects, whereas a combination of scatterometry and through-focus imaging can achieve a promising 0.6% accuracy, and a combination of scatterometry and Zernike Phase-Contrast imaging can achieve a superior 0.1% accuracy. Experimental results based on imaging and scatterometry clearly display 3D effects that differ substantially from idealized rigorous simulations, suggesting the difficulty of accurately predicting 3D effects and hence the need to accurately measure them.", "Mitigation of 3D-mask effects is a requirement for pushing high-NA (0.55) EUV lithography to its limits. Both the absorber and the reflective multilayer parts of the EUV mask contribute to the 3D-mask effects. This paper focuses on the investigation and optimization of the multilayer. The impact of different multilayer parameters on the imaging performance is investigated and used to explain the optimization outcome. Multilayer optimization yields better lithographic performance by including imaging metrics in the merit function instead of reflectivity data only. Different geometrical representations of the multilayer are optimized and their performances are compared. The results show a tradeoff among different lithographic metrics with improvements compared to a reference obtained from reflectivity optimization.", "With conventional methods, improvements in optical proximity correction (OPC) runtime and accuracy can be challenging. Often improvements in accuracy have limited impact or require longer runtimes. Conversely, improvements in runtime often come at a sacrifice to overall correction quality. OPC industries have been developing and applying machine-learning (ML) methods to address both issues together, such as the Newron\u00ae machine learning family of products, which provides for both faster ML-based correction and more accurate resist models. Benchmark testing shows that ML-based correction prediction can yield runtime improvements of 30% or more without sacrificing pattern fidelity. It also shows that a ML resist model can deliver simulation accuracy 15% better than a conventional lithography model. This paper discusses the conversion flow from baseline OPC recipe to ML-accelerated recipe and presents results of a study that applies this technique to a sub-5 nm EUV test case, as well as results of a study that leverages a ML resist model to improve OPC accuracy.", "Finding a process window and improving the yield for EUV single exposure nodes requires an understanding of stochastic defects. Stochastic simulations can be used as a tool to understand the influence of the process on defectivity. This presentation introduces stochastic model calibration with the purpose of matching lithographic observables. The validity of this approach will be shown based on comparison of measured defectivity data and matching stochastic simulations.", "Advanced characterization techniques for nanoscale photoresist structure Miquel Salmeron, Slavomir Nemsak, and Patrick Naulleau Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California Berkeley The spatial chemical structure of photoresists before and after processing is currently limited to a resolution of 10\u2019s of nanometers, far above the desirable level of mono and sub-nm resolution that can enable the next generation of microelectronic circuits and devices. We will discuss in this presentation novel characterization techniques that will open the door for advanced spectroscopic characterization of polymer interfaces both in the latent image and the developed image. Among the new techniques being currently developed we will describe plasmonically enhanced infrared spectroscopy that provides FTIR spectra with nm x-y resolution along the interface between the photoresist and the substrate/underlayer. Additionally, we will present Standing Wave X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy in soft and tender X-ray regime, which provides elemental and chemical state composition in the z-direction across surfaces and buried interfaces. Currently these techniques have provided the first nanoscale characterization of the molecular structure of solid-liquid interfaces, revealing the chemical structure of the electrical double layer, of crucial importance in batteries, corrosion phenomena, and electrocatalysis. Applications to the polymer-substrate interface is currently underway.", "As feature sizes continue to shrink, low-k1 lithographic processes are required to advance chip technologies. In this context, both advances in optical systems and imaging capabilities as well as improvements in EUV photoresist have led to practical gains in resolution. This work focusses on our latest attempt to characterize photoresist performance by a metric that can effectively exclude all other contributors (e.g. scanner) and quantify the true photoresist capabilities. By a cautious analysis of the previous k4 metric for several use cases and resist platforms (chemically amplified vs. metal-oxide resist), we propose an improved formula that incorporates key resist attributes.", "Recently, the metal oxide nanoclusters (or nanoparticles) have attracted much attention as a promising candidate for a resist material used for the high-volume manufacturing of semiconductor devices. The radiation-induced reactions of ligands play an important role in the sensitization of metal oxide nanocluster resists. In this study, the radiation-induced reactions of carboxylic acid ligands were investigated using a pulse radiolysis method. The results obtained in this study indicated that the molecular structures of ligands affect their reactivity to cationic and anion species and the stability of their radical cations and anions.", "The most pressing issue facing extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) as a multi-node technology is the inability to effectively manage stochastic effects. Fundamentally linked to the discrete nature of absorbed light (photons) and photo or electron-active components in the photoresist, stochastic effects lead to non-idealities in printed features, which for lines manifests itself as line edge and width roughness, and in the extreme cases, line breaks and bridges. However, measurement of stochastic propagation in photoresist has been hampered by the lack of metrology capable of probing the resist at intermediate stages of the patterning process. Here we present the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure the image in resist prior to photoresist development. In particular, the method was used to analyze the role of bake time on important resist metrics such as critical dimension, edge roughness, and roughness correlation length.", "EUV photon absorption by a resist film leads to emission of a photoelectron and several low kinetic energy secondary electrons. The \u201cuniversal curve\u201d, used in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, suggests that the low kinetic energy electrons may travel tens to hundreds of nanometers in solids until they inelastically scatter. The fact that electrons travel long distances before they may initiate chemical reactions ultimately result in blur of the aerial image, reducing the contrast and subsequently resolution of the resist. In this work, we will present an experimental approach to determine secondary electron attenuation length (EAL) \u2013 the thickness of resist material required to reduce number of emitted secondary electrons to 1/e of initial. The EAL describes how far secondary electrons can travel in a resist film and is directly related to the electron blur. Possibilities to gain additional information on electron penetration depth in resist films will also be discussed.", "For the past years, ArF immersion has been employed as the major lithography tool in the foundry manufacturing to fabricate the patterns of minimum pitch and size. However, for semiconductor scaling beyond N7 the application of EUV lithography is considered to be crucially important to overcome the physical limitation of ArF immersion and to realize even smaller patterns. In the case of ArF photo processes, the best mask size for a specific pitch could be selected with the consideration of optical performances such as NILS, MEEF, etc. In contrast, for the EUV processes the optical and resist stochastic effect should also be taken into account as an important factor in deciding the best mask size. In this paper, we are going to discuss the dose and mask size optimization process for an DRAM contact hole layer with EUV lithography utilizing stochastic simulations; this contains also the stochastic response of the resist. In order to calibrate a predictive stochastic resist model, which is required for this application, measurements of the stochastic resist response are necessary. In addition, the systematic and stochastic errors of CD-SEM measurements have to be estimated. We will compare experimentally obtained NILS and MEEF to simulated results, which are in very good agreement. Also, we show a comparison of experimental and computational analysis of LCDU (Local CD Uniformity).", "In this preliminary computational chemistry study, we report excitation selectivity in a model tin-oxo molecular resist. Upon impact ionization, organic side chains connected to 6-coordinated tin atoms (located near the charge balancing ligands) are preferentially destabilized. Upon electron addition, conversely, side chains connected to 5-coordinated tin atoms (located on the central belt) are destabilized. Inferring from the binding energies, the ionization induced processes likely have a smaller spatial extent than electron attachment induced process.", "EUV lithography wafer production has begun and consequently maximizing yield gains importance. One key component to high-yield lithography in manufacturing is using a pellicle to hold particles out of the focal plane and thereby minimize their impact on imaging. Using a pellicle simplifies manufacturing by eliminating wafer inspections that are used to indirectly monitor the presence of printable defects on the mask. The CNT-based pellicle \u2013 a membrane consisting of a network of carbon nanotubes \u2013 offers the advantage of very high EUV transmission and has demonstrated good durability at high EUV scanner power. Moreover, the microscopic properties of the network can be tuned by modifying several CNT membrane parameters, such as the individual CNT type and diameter, the degree of bundling, the density and the coating. The challenge is balancing these CNT material parameters for optimal performance in the EUV scanner: high transmission, low impact on imaging through scattered light, and low probability for particles to pass. Each of these areas will be addressed along with simulated and experimental data illustrating the value of a CNT-based EUV pellicle solution today and for the future.", "In this paper, we present two methods for directly measuring the effective complex reflectance function of a patterned EUV mask. Obtaining this measurement can provide important insight into a number of key areas in EUV mask development, including obtaining a deeper understanding of mask 3-D effects, and characterizing and quantifying the amplitude and phase generated by attenuated and etched phase shift masks. The first method, Quantitative Zernike Phase Contrast Microscopy (QZPCM), works by modulating the imaging pupil function with several known phase shifts, and obtaining through-focus images of a target area for each pupil setting. The second method, Lateral Shearing Imaging (LSI), works by splitting and interfering two copies of the complex amplitude function in the image plane separated by a distance s. The resulting fringe pattern gives information about the derivative of the complex amplitude in the direction of the shift. We present results from two experiments: the first demonstrates QZPCM at EUV on the Berkeley SHARP microscope, and the second utilizes LSI in an optical prototype using a visible light laser source.", "Coherence control and flexible pupil fill play a key role in the imaging of EUV reticles. This is also true for lensless metrology applications based on coherent diffraction imaging. We describe the concept and the key components of a Fourier synthesis illuminator designed to provide the RESCAN microscope with flexible illumination capabilities and to improve its resolution limit. In particular, we discuss the characteristics of the three mirrors of the new illuminator and the requirements for their multilayer coating.", "Stochastics defect detection has been a topic of intense study by the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) patterning fraternity [1]. A large part of this initial feasibility work has been performed using electron microscope-based systems [1,2]. A limited sample area is imaged using electron microscopes and images are analyzed using offline analysis techniques [1,2]. However, to accurately quantify the stochastics failure rate, the entire area of interest needs to be inspected. Given such large area inspection requirements, automated and high throughput solutions are the need of the hour to enable stochastics quantification in HVM (high volume manufacturing). This paper demonstrates Broadband Plasma optical wafer inspection capability to capture two key defects on EUV layers a) missing contact in contact hole array patterns b) line breaks in line- space pattern.", "As extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) enters high volume manufacturing (HVM), the integrated circuit (IC) industry considers actinic patterned mask inspection (APMI) to be the last major EUV mask infrastructure gap. For over 20 years, there have been calls for an APMI tool for both the final qualification of EUV masks in the mask shop and for the requalification of EUV masks in the wafer fab1. Actinic, in this context, is matching the 13.5 nm scanner wavelength to that of the inspection tool so that all types of EUV mask defects can be detected. In order to enable EUVL HVM, we have developed and introduced the world\u2019s first commercially available APMI tool. Actinic inspection enables HVM EUVL by ensuring that the EUV mask going to the EUV scanner is free from EUVprintable defects that may have been overlooked during EUV blank manufacturing or occurred during EUV mask manufacturing, cleaning and use. In this paper we will review EUV mask defect requirements from the maskshop and fab perspective, as well as capabilities of different inspection methods available for HVM. Further, we will provide an overview of the history of APMI tool development and highlight challenges and successes made when designing major components for the tool. APMI enables reliable detection of all classes of EUV-printable mask defects: small absorber defects, phase and amplitude defects in the multi-layer, In this paper, inspection performance of the APMI tool will be reviewed using representative cases from programmed defect masks with designs resembling real production cases. Finally, we will provide an outlook for the next steps in tool development including Die-to-Database inspection, throughpellicle inspection and platform extendibility to high NA EUVL.", "We explore various resolution enhancement techniques and investigate their patterning benefits for via patterns of the 3-nm logic node using computational lithography. Simulations are performed by the method of source mask optimization (SMO) using the TachyonTM software. Key assessed process parameters include edge placement error (EPE), overlap process window, image NILS, local CD uniformity and NILS depth of focus (nDOF). Simulation results show that the current mask technology employing the standard Ta-based metallic absorber does not offer enough patterning performance for vias of pitch 40 nm and below. SMO results indicate that high-absorption absorbers give a clear improvement in best-focus shift and pattern placement error while phase-shift masks result in a significant increase of NILS and nDOF. EPE improvement of multiple technologies are also investigated. Novel EUV masks together with advanced imaging with low pupil-filling ratio and curvilinear OPC, combined with highresolution and low-roughness resist and enhanced etch process are among the key enabling technologies to extend EUV single patterning to 3-nm logic via layers.", "In this work, we present a novel resistless patterning technique on hydrogen-terminated Si (100) using EUV-induced surface reaction. We has successfully demonstrated a direct Si pattern transfer of half-pitch 75 nm Si gratings using the EUV resistless patterning technique. The EUV-induced surface reactions could achieve direct patterning on functionalized Si surface and potentially overcome the resolution limitations of conventional photoresists in the semiconductor industry. Moreover, this approach can be used for better understanding of EUV exposure mechanisms by preparing simple molecular systems and studying the EUV-induced reactions.", "Since the expected exposure dose of photoresist is an important parameter in the usability of EUV at a reasonable cost, the Lithography IRDS Focus Team (IFT) developed a photospeed projection as part of the 2019 IRDS lithography roadmap. We used two different methods to do this. Both methods started with the assumption that the 7-nm node critical layers exposed using EUV single exposure just meet the CDU requirement. This is equivalent to assuming that EUV users picked the fastest resist possible that still met requirements. Method one was to separate the required CD control for the 7nm node into a portion due to photon shot noise and a portion due to resist stochastics. Although the literature has widely varying numbers for the relative amounts of photon shot noise and resist stochastics, this approach did provide some insight. If one assumes most of the CDU is mostly due to photon stochastics, then substantial resist improvements from node to node, for example 20% less stochastic CD variation, doesn\u2019t make much difference to the total stochastics. But if there isn\u2019t resist improvement, then even doubling the source power from node to node won\u2019t meet CDU requirements. If we assume that resist stochastics make up almost all of the CDU observed at the 7-nm node, then no reasonable amount of dose increase meets future requirements. Only if a combination of significant resist improvement and significant dose increases is used can you meet requirements. The second approach was to extrapolate using k4.1 In this case, assuming a typical current value of k4, we estimate a typical line and space 7-nm node exposure dose to be to be 36 mJ/cm2. We used the reported historical improvement in equivalent k1 for resists as a guide for how fast resist k4 can improve. This projected that typical resist exposure doses will have to increase over 30% per node on average to meet CDU and LER requirements for the leading-edge logic devices, leading to dose requirements < 100 mJ/cm2 by the 1.5 nm node. We will discuss the challenges in meeting this roadmap and how the industry may adapt to the future challenge of lower noise imaging processes.", "With the adoption of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography across the semiconductor industry, there comes a need to develop new resist materials that will become the mainstay enabling technology. This development places pressure on the metrology community to develop adequate non-destructive techniques capable of measuring the sub-10 nm patterns that such resists are meant to produce. Recent progress in grazing incidence and resonant x-ray scattering techniques [1-3] have shown particular promise at being able to address part of these characterization challenges. In this paper, we highlight the potential for various techniques which use energy-tunable x-rays to probe buried structures critical to progress in EUVL. We show how resonant contrast can harness spatially distributed chemical heterogeneities within a resist in order to probe buried structures in a variety of photoresists containing key inorganic components. Specifically, by focusing on inorganic/organic hybrid resists, we demonstrate the potential insights from and correlation between contrast acquired at different elemental absorption edges and chemistries from a given resist.", "When it comes to the patterning of periodic structures like lines and spaces or contact hole arrays interference lithography can be effectively applied. By the use of ultrashort wavelengths in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range, structure sizes can be pushed into the sub-100 nm region. Using advanced interference schemes, such as achromatic Talbot imaging, high-quality large-area patterning can be realized, e.g. for resist stochastics tests as well as for advanced fabrication processes in research and also small-batch production. Since the Talbot lithography only requires medium spatial coherence and accepts broadband emission, the approach can be used not only with coherent radiation as provided by synchrotron facilities but also with compact plasma-based EUV sources. In this contribution the theoretical resolution limit for the achromatic Talbot lithography is determined by simulations for the use of optimized phase-shifting transmission mask concepts illuminated by compact discharge-produced plasma EUV source operating at a main wavelength of 13.5 nm. The further effects that reduce a practical resolution limit, such as mask imperfections, positioner instabilities and resist contrast are also considered. With the realized EUV laboratory exposure tool and polymer-based contact hole phase-shifting masks 28 nm resolution has been demonstrated so far. Main limitations are found in the mask fabrication process that cannot be further down-scaled due to increasing aspect ratios and pattern degradation of the mask structures. To extend the developed nanopatterning technology to the sub-30 nm region, optimized phase-shifting transmission masks have to be designed and fabricated, enabling a contrast-rich intensity modulation in wafer plane. As size of the mask openings is approaching the exposure wavelength, mask geometry has to be optimized for every node. In this paper rigorous simulations of new mask designs optimized for the achromatic Talbot lithography are presented. For selected phase-shifting transmission masks, the influence of the mask material and geometry on the resulting aerial image is evaluated along with an analysis of the theoretical resolution limit.", "The application / effect of alternative developers for resist-based pattern defect mitigation was investigated. It was found that compared to the standard aqueous 0.26N TMAH developer solution, the same developer at lower concentration effectively improve the defect margin (indicated here in the form of a defect-sensitive exposure latitude (ELX) and critical dimension margin (CDMX) metric). Moreover, the existence of a developer concentration low limit, where ELX and CDMX significantly decrease, was observed. Alternative developers TEAH, TPAH and TBAH, when adjusted to the most effective developer concentration were found to improve defect margin. These results show the advantages of pursuing optimal developer solutions in mitigating resist-based defects while maintaining lithographic performance.", "The EUV BeamLine 2 (EBL2) is being used to expose samples to EUV radiation for optics and mask lifetime testing. Before and after exposure the samples can be analyzed in-situ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). During exposure the samples can be monitored in real-time by an imaging ellipsometer. We report on the development of two additional real-time diagnostic systems that further extend the capabilities of the EBL2 system, a thermal imaging system and an EUV reflectometer. The thermal imaging system monitors the sample surface radiation during accelerated lifetime tests and the EUV reflectometer is able to monitor the sample reflectivity in real-time. These diagnostics systems will allow for a more efficient use of the EBL2 beam-time and therefore speed up the development of EUV optics suitable for high source power and high NA imaging.", "With the introduction of the NXE:3400B scanner, ASML has brought EUV to High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM). The high EUV power of >200W being realized with this system satisfies the throughput requirements of HVM, but also requires reconsideration of the imaging aspects of spectral purity, both from the details of the EUV emission spectrum and from the DUV emission. This paper will present simulation and experimental results for the spectral purity of high-power EUV systems, and the imaging impact of this, both for the case of with and without a pellicle. Also, possible controls for spectral purity will be discussed, and a novel method will be described to measure imaging impact of varying CE and DUV. It will be shown that CE optimization towards higher source power leads to reduction in relative DUV content, that the small deltas in EUV source spectrum for higher power do not influence imaging. It will also be shown that resulting variations in DUV do not affect imaging performance significantly, provided that a suitable reticle black border is used. In short, spectral purity performance is not a bottleneck for increasing power of EUV systems to well above 250W.", "For generations lithographers have worked to overcome the difficulties associated with defect mitigation, and since EUV lithography has become mature enough for HVM this concern is warranting ever increasing attention to make such processes profitable. Even though much of the EUV defect effort is focused on stochastic defects, in this work we attempt to assess and understand process defects associated with the interaction between different films in an EUV stack. By understanding the behavior of specific underlayer materials and their chemistry within a given environment we have attempted to tune the surface energies to match the photoresist in the stack. With the correct process changes being applied, we have then worked to correlate the proper matching of surface energies with process defects. The current focus of our work is specifically line collapse, and we believe that developing a fuller understanding of the film interactions will ultimately lead to a more robust EUV process for HVM. We hereby present our work utilizing the SCREEN DUO coat develop track system with an ASML NXE:3300 in the imec Leuven cleanroom facility.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) systems struggle from both low source brightness and low source throughput through the tool. For these reasons, photon shot noise will play a much larger role in image process development for EUVL than in DUV processes. Furthermore, the lower photon count increases the stochastic variation of all the processes which occur after photon absorption. This causes the printed edge to move away from the mean edge with some probability. This paper will present a model form and calibration flow for including stochastic probability bands in compact models suitable for full chip simulation. This model form relies on calibrating to statistical data from a rigorous EUV stochastic lithography model calibrated to wafer experimental data. The data generation, data preparation, and model calibration flows for the compact stochastic probability bands will be presented. We will show that this model form can predict patterns which are prone to stochastic pattern failure in realistic mask designs, as well as how this model form can be used downstream for full chip correction (e.g., SMO, OPC and/or ILT).", "Actinic patterned mask inspection (APMI) is the last major part of the infrastructure required for EUV lithography to be developed. A coherent imaging approach is proposed as a plausible solution requiring incremental improvements to available components. Diffractive optics direct a mW 13.5nm coherent beam to the mask and to interfere at the imaging detector. A motion system translates the mask between exposures. A non-iterative algorithm generates a complex reflectivity (mask image) estimate from each interferogram, in real time with GPU hardware. Realistic simulation results and requirements for the system components are presented. Except for the FEL that is likely required, many elements of the system are simpler and likely less costly than an incoherent imager. The system can be configured to image the mask through a pellicle. Of note, focus tolerance is loose as the focal distance is a software parameter.", "This paper describes the impact of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) resist thickness on <30 nm Via Local Critical Dimension Uniformity (LCDU) measured during After Development Inspection (ADI) and After Etch Inspection (AEI). For the same post-etch CD targets, increasing resist thickness from 40 to 60 nm helped reduced CD variability. This work was performed via virtual fabrication using Coventor\u2019s SEMulator3D\u00ae software and was confirmed experimentally. Post litho and post etch CD variations were introduced by considering lithography dose and focus variations in the model. Lithography and etch models were calibrated using 3D resist profile simulations from HyperLith\u00ae and post-etch Cross Section Scanning Electron Microscope (XSEM) images, respectively.", "Gigaphoton Inc. has been developing a CO2-Sn-LPP (LPP: Laser Produced Plasma) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source system for high-volume manufacturing (HVM) semiconductor lithography. Key components of the source include a high-power CO2 laser with 15 ns pulse duration and 100 kHz repetition frequency, a solid-state pre-pulse laser with 10 ps pulse duration, a high-speed Sn-droplet generator, a high-speed and high accuracy shooting system, and a magnetic field debris mitigation system. To achieve an in-band power of 330 W with long collector mirror lifetime and stable output, we improved the performance of key system components; especially, the laser beam quality at 27 kW CO2 laser output power by upgrading the CO2 laser beam transfer system, the dose stability and suppression of small Tin (Sn) debris, upgrading a shooting control system, improvement of the collector mirror degradation rate by the optimization of H2 flow condition, and changing the EUV chamber structure. We achieved an in-band power of 250W under DC operation and demonstrated a power scalability up to 365W. This paper presents the key technology update of our EUV light source.", "High-volume production of semiconductor devices by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has started since 2019. A high numerical aperture tool is planned to extend the use of EUV lithography. The trade-off relationships between resolution, line edge roughness (LER), and sensitivity are a significant concern for the extendability of EUV lithography. In previous study, the dependences of chemical gradient (an indicator of LER) on the half-pitch of line-and-space patterns, the sensitivity, the sensitizer concentration, and the effective reaction radius for deprotection were investigated using a simulation on the basis of the sensitization and reaction mechanisms of chemically amplified EUV resists. Although the relationships between resolution, LER, and sensitivity were formulated in the half-pitch range lager than 10 nm, they were deviated from the equations in the sub-10 nm half-pitch resolution region. Recently, the application of information science to the material engineering has attracted much attention. In this study, the feasibility of the application of machine learning to the analysis of trade-off relationships was investigated. The sub-10 nm region was fitted well using lasso.", "Although being progressively introduced to mass production, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography still faces major challenges for 5nm and smaller nodes due to the impact of stochastic and processing failures, resulting in very narrow defect process windows. 1 These failures are strongly linked to critical dimension (CD) variations.2 Therefore, careful control of CD is now directly linked to defect reduction in addition to more conventional in-film particles/developer residues reduction. Photoresist profiles are also believed to be one possible limiting factor and improvements via collapse control or increased resist mask thickness for etch transfer need to be considered. In this paper, most recent understandings regarding defect process window limitations and optimization of processes to further enable narrow pitch EUV lithography will be presented.", "This paper describes the successful combination of masking or beam shaping elements based on thin membranes with the thermally ultra-stable properties of the ULE [1] glass substrate material. These kind of elements can be used in transmission in the optical beam path of EUV systems.\nBy applying a combination of new technologies, thin membranes can be directly manufactured on ULE substrates. The thermal expansion properties of the membrane based transmissive optical elements are dominated by ULE substrate. These elements enable a position stability of features in the range of 10-8/Kelvin for element sizes with a length of up to 150 mm.\nThe combination of technologies enables also the structuring of features with critical dimensions in the range of 100 nm on the membrane. The features on the membranes are for example absorbing or phase shifting structures or even holes. Holes in the membrane with diameters down to 200 nm have been demonstrated using e-beam based technologies.\nThese kind of transmissive optical elements could be used in EUV exposure systems, actinic mask inspection systems or other optical systems which are using light in the EUV wavelength range.", "In EUV lithography, the short wavelength and residual mirror surface roughness increase the flare levels across the slit. As a key research point, the flares of different exposure fields are carefully discussed by numerical simulation. To ensure the effectiveness and practicability of our simulations, the test patterns are generated according to the general design rules for 7nm technology node. The NILS, process variation band (PVB) and MEEFs from mask optimizations and source mask optimizations (SMO) results are compared. From the comparisons, the constant flare has a greater influence on NILS and PVB than that on MEEF. In contrast, the flare map caused more reduction on the MEEF values.", "Currently advanced DRAM design is beyond ArFi resolution limit, especially for the challenging processes in memory cell and core circuit pattern [1]. When devices keep shrinking, multi-patterning with ArFi becomes more and more difficult to reach the process requirements in terms of pattern decomposition, process window loss with complex process integration, defect, and immersion resolution limits. Besides multi-patterning also suffers design cost, mask learning cycle and layout restriction. Currently 0.33NA EUV can provide 16nm pattern single exposure and cover all design circuit requirement. High resolution enhances 2D pattern process window for friendly layout design and better OVL control so it is a good choice to introduce EUV process for DRAM manufacturing.\nWe evaluate to apply EUV in memory cell instead of the two possible solutions of SADP with cut layer and LELE trimming with multi-mask to simplify processes. Memory cell is periodic main feature for the most area on a mask and dominates the most EUV OPC run time in full shot correction. In this paper we try to find a best way to handle cell area OPC and evaluate single mask to accomplish memory cell patterning.", "An EUV source optimization technique using compressive sensing is introduced in this paper. The pixelated source pattern is sparsely represented in a set of certain basis functions. Blue noise sampling method is used to select sampling points around the margins of the target layout for imaging fidelity evaluation. Based on the compressive sensing theory, the EUV SO is formulated as an l1-norm inverse reconstruction problem and solved by the linearized Bregman algorithm. Different types of sparse bases are also experimented in this paper to investigate their impact on the SO results. These bases include the 2D-DCT basis, spatial basis, Zernike basis, and Haar wavelet basis. Simulations show that \u2113the Haar wavelet basis results in the best imaging fidelity among the four types of bases.", "With the introduction of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the control of contamination has become crucial. Sources for contamination in EUV lithography scanners are not limited to only particle generation and release inside the scanner environment but may be introduced from outside as well, e.g. through translational and/or rotational (robotic) feedthroughs.\nIn this contribution we highlight our joint (TU/e and VDL ETG) research efforts aimed at the development of plasma-enabled contamination control strategies. The focus in this research is on airborne particles immersed in a low pressure gas flow that interact with both the afterglow of a plasma and an externally applied electric field.\nA flexible experimental setup has been developed and will be introduced which is able to study the interaction between contaminants, plasmas and externally applied electric fields. Our results show that the designed configuration allows to carefully control the residual charges of the particles as well as their positions and trajectories with respect to the gas flow in which they are immersed. These results, together with the understanding of the underlying principle processes, open-up various possibilities to achieve improved cleanliness of the mentioned systems.", "Quantum computing has been a long-anticipated emerging computational paradigm to complement and compete with conventional CMOS technologies. The last decade has featured reports of the initial development of using CMOS processing techniques for qubits and the atomistic fabrication of single atom transistors. Will the semiconductor industry embrace this new architype, and if so, how? When quantum devices begin to scale as predicted, will our industry be ready to integrate radically different architectures and device structures? Are there known obstacles not yet addressed that would enable the industry to more readily adopt and benefit from today\u2019s achievements in the laboratory? What are the emerging designs and the potential fundamental challenges that are to be overcome?

While there appeared to be good reasons initially to invest substantially, in terms of people and money, in these concepts, most were not ultimately adopted for use in high-volume manufacturing (HVM). In this year\u2019s symposium-wide panel, people who were involved in developing these concepts will share their perspectives on what lessons can be learned from their experiences.", "In 1970, Canon introduced its PLA mask aligner tool for the patterning of features on the order of 10 microns. Wafer sizes at the time were on the order of 50 to 75 mm, and circuitry was relatively simple. Since this time, the device landscape and pattern requirements have changed significantly over the last 50 years as has the markets that are served. Sensors and power devices are still made on relatively small wafers, while the integrated circuit manufacturing has standardized largely on 300mm wafers at various resolutions depending on devices or packaging. Displays are manufactured on much larger glass substrates with higher resolution mobile displays on Gen 6 substrates with large television displays up to Gen 10 which are several meters square. Canon has focused on providing a wide range of lithography equipment to cover the complete needs of our customers. From launching the first proximity mask aligners in 1970, in accordance with Moore's law, the lithography equipment has evolved in order to increase the degree of integration of semiconductor devices and reduce the critical dimensions of the devices. As for flat panel display lithography equipment, a mirror projection exposure tool, the MPA was introduced in the early 1980s. In recent years, i-line lithography equipment has been used for advanced packaging, specifically Fan Out Wafer Level Packaging interposers due to the demand for ultra-dense packaging for smartphones and wearables. Most recently Canon has developed a nanoimprint solution for the patterning of advanced memory devices. Imprint lithography is an effective and well-known technique for replication of nano-scale features. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) manufacturing equipment utilizes a patterning technology that involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. The technology faithfully reproduces patterns with a higher resolution and greater uniformity compared to those produced by photolithography equipment. In this paper we review the Canon product line and describe how it is being used to address semiconductor patterning, packaging and flat panel display manufacturing.", "The steady advance of nanotechnology from investigation to application and to manufacturing is increasing the demands on nanoscale metrology and lithography and surface chemical analysis. As dimensions shrink to the nano-scale, the available metrologies, necessary for any advanced manufacturing process, become limited. In this seminar we present how we can achieve state of the art results in nano lithography and metrology and possibly NSOM using functionalized III-N nanowires. We will show as, such a single wide-bandgap tip technology offers the functionality and versatility of several incumbent technologies in one single, universal, system.", "Although the field of optical lithography is highly investigated and numerous improvements are made, structure sizes smaller than 20 nm can only be achieved by considerable effort when using conventional technology. To cover the upcoming tasks in future lithography, enormous exertion is put into the development of alternative fabrication technologies in particular for micro- and nanotechnologies that are capable of measuring and patterning at the atomic scale in growing operating areas of several hundred square millimetres. Many new technologies resulted in this process, and are promising to overcome the current limitations1, 2, but most of them are demonstrated in small areas of several square micrometers only, using state-of-the-art piezo stages or the like. At the Technische Universitat Ilmenau, the NanoFabrication Machine 100 (NFM-100) was developed, which serves as an important experimental platform for basic research in the field of scale-spanning AFM tip-based and laser-based nanomeasuring and nanofabrication for simultaneous subnanometre measuring and structuring on surfaces up to \u00d8100 mm. This machine can be equipped with several probing systems like AFM, laser focus probes and 3D-micro probes as well as tools for different nanofabrication technologies like tip-based technologies, optical technologies and mechanical two-dimensional technologies in a large working range with subnanometre reproducibility and uncertainty. In this paper, the specifics and advantages of the NFM-100 will be described as well as nanofabrication technologies that are currently worked on e.g. advanced scanning proximal probe lithography based on Fowler-Nordheim-electron-field emission, direct laser writing and UV-nanoimprint lithography.", "Imprint lithography is an effective and well-known technique for replication of nano-scale features.

Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. The technology faithfully reproduces patterns with a higher resolution and greater uniformity compared to those produced by photolithography equipment. Additionally, as this technology does not require an array of wide-diameter lenses and the expensive light sources necessary for advanced photolithography equipment, NIL equipment achieves a simpler, more compact design, allowing for multiple units to be clustered together for increased productivity. Previous studies have demonstrated NIL resolution better than 10nm, making the technology suitable for the printing of several generations of critical memory levels with a single mask. In addition, resist is applied only where necessary, thereby eliminating material waste. Given that there are no complicated optics in the imprint system, the reduction in the cost of the tool, when combined with simple single level processing and zero waste leads to a cost model that is very compelling for semiconductor memory applications. Any new lithographic technology to be introduced into manufacturing must deliver either a performance advantage or a cost advantage. Key technical attributes include alignment, overlay and throughput. In previous papers, overlay and throughput results have been reported on test wafers. In this work, improvements to the alignment system, together with the High Order Distortion Correction (HODC) system have enabled better distortion and overlay results. On test wafers, XMMO of 3.2nm and 2.8nm in x and y respectively was demonstrated. There is also an opportunity to further improve results by applying wafer chucks with better flatness specifications. Further advances have also been made through the application of a multi-wavelength alignment strategy. Finally, we discuss how computational methods can enhance NIL productivity and reduce the number of learning cycles", "Imprint lithography is a promising technology for replication of nano-scale features. For semiconductor device applications, Canon deposits a low viscosity resist on a field by field basis using jetting technology. A patterned mask is lowered into the resist fluid, which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. Overlay budgets play a large role in defining production readiness. As an example, DRAM devices require overlay on the order of 15-20% of the half pitch. Canon uses a through the mask (TTM) alignment system to measure a Moir\u00e9 image anywhere in the field. This system can also record alignment errors of all fields and all marks. The data collected by the TTM system correlates very closely with an Archer measurement tool. In addition, a High Order Distortion Correction (HODC) system, which applies a heat input on a field by field basis through the use of a DMD array has been combined with magnification actuators to correct high order distortion terms up to K30. There is an additional distortion term that must also be addressed for the case of nanoimprint lithography. NIL drop patterns are typically designed to minimize resist fill time and create a uniform residual layer beneath the resist pattern. For device wafers, however, it is important to recognize that there are both long wavelength flatness errors coming from the wafer chuck and existing pattern topography from previously patterned levels that cause out of plane errors. When the mask comes in contact with the resist on the wafer, these out of plane errors can then induce mask bending, resulting in an additional distortion term. To minimize this distortion, a Drop Pattern Compensation (DPC) Model has been implemented to minimize the added distortion terms. In this paper we present an updated study and report on nanoimprint mix and match overlay improvements using DPC. In addition, we describe how the mode array and peak to valley thickness of the resist impacts distortion correction.", "The mission of QuTech is to bring quantum technology to industry and society by translating fundamental scientific research into applied research. To this end we are developing Quantum Inspire (QI), a full-stack quantum computer prototype for future co-development and collaborative R&D in quantum computing. A prerelease of this prototype system is already offering the public cloud-based access to QuTech technologies such as a programmable quantum computer simulator (with up to 31 qubits) and tutorials and user background knowledge on quantum information science (www.quantum-inspire.com). Access to a programmable CMOS-compatible Silicon spin qubit-based quantum processor will be provided in the next deployment phase. The first generation of QI\u2019s quantum processors consists of a double quantum dot hosted in an in-house grown SiGe/28Si/SiGe heterostructure, and defined with a single layer of Al gates. Here we give an overview of important aspects of the QI full-stack. We illustrate QI\u2019s modular system architecture and we will touch on parts of the manufacturing and electrical characterization of its first generation two spin qubit quantum processor unit. We close with a section on QI\u2019s qubit calibration framework. The definition of a single qubit Pauli X gate is chosen as concrete example of the matching of an experiment to a component of the circuit model for quantum computation.", "Multi-beam mask writers (MBMW) manufactured by IMS Nanofabrication have been increasingly been accepted into mainstream mask making. Over the past decade, this new class of tools has successfully transitioned from the concept, to development and finally to the production phase. Significant technical challenges specific to the architecture were encountered and overcome. Many of these challenges are related to the large image size used by this writer. In this paper, we will review the motivation to develop this new class of writers and the key technical challenges which had to be overcome to realize lithographic promise. Current status and future opportunities to improve the architecture will be discussed.", "Laser mask pattern generators (MPGs) write the majority today\u2019s masks. They are the tools of choice for the application spaces of legacy-node chip production and second-level writing for advanced masks. Increasingly, they are also being used to print masks with large data volumes resulting from optical proximity corrections. To improve throughput and print performance for these masks, a software-based data path has been implemented on the ALTA\u00ae multi-beam MPG platform. Running on a scalable multicore architecture, the new data path provides more than an order of magnitude increase in processing speed for data preparation and rasterization compared to the existing hardware solution. The programs performing the data preparation and rasterization, along with the general-purpose computers on which they run, are referred to as the raster engine (RE). The RE accepts MEBES\u00ae, OASIS\u00ae, and GDSIITM formats, optimizes the data on a 0.1-nm grid, and applies both system and user-defined critical dimension (CD) corrections prior to printing. During mask printing, the prepared data are rasterized out to a 0.5-nm writing grid while applying additional corrections required by the ALTA architecture. A beam engine (BE) converts the rasterized data to radio frequency (RF) signals that drive the 32-channel acousto-optical modulator. The edge-placement resolution in the scan direction is controlled using timing rather than grey level interpolation of a fixed pixel grid. The stripe-axis resolution is achieved using fixed beam spacing with 80 gray intensity levels. Significant improvements are observed in the scan-axis print performance and the consistency of corner rounding. This paper also examines the effects of the number of passes used in multi-pass printing on the tradeoff between print quality and mask write times. Finally, the capability to align to the fiducials defined by the SEMI P48 standard for EUV masks has been added to the ALTA system.", "This presentation introduces the technology and capabilities of the current ULTRA mask writer by Heidelberg Instruments and explains more in detail the possibilities to enhance the performance by introducing software-based optimizations with the MASKER and BEAMER software tools introduced by Genisys GmbH. We will discuss the results for CD linearity and CD uniformity accomplished by ULTRA, the feature fidelity correction and will also look at plans for further developments.", "Multicolumn Electron Beam Lithography (MEBL), a proprietary technology platform developed by Multibeam Corporation, is being applied to enable Security Lithography \u2013 a maskless embedding of unique security information into each IC during routine wafer fabrication. This paper focuses on ensuring Secure Chip ID, which provides traceability of a chip throughout its lifecycle and enables confirmation of its unique identity and provenance.

This paper also shows how MEBL hardcoding of the Secure Chip ID \u201cat the silicon level\u201d makes the embedding process cost-efficient and tamperproof.", "Bio-sourced and biodegradable polymers for additive manufacturing could enable the rapid fabrication of parts for a broad spectrum of applications ranging from healthcare to aerospace. Herein, we report a resin for vat photopolymerization based on the protein, bovine serum albumin, using a commercially available laser-scanning stereolithographic apparatus (SLA) printer. Methacrylated bovine serum albumin (MA-BSA) was synthesized and formulated into aqueous resins that were used to print complex 3D objects with a resolution comparable to a commercially available resin. The MA-BSA resins were characterized by rheometry to determine the viscosity and the cure rate, as both parameters can ultimately be used to predict the printability of the resin. In the first step of patterning these materials, the MA-BSA resin was 3D printed, and in the second step, the printed construct was thermally cured to denature the globular protein and increase the intermolecular noncovalent interactions. These resins are expected to be compatible with other vat photopolymerization processes, including digital light projection (DLP) and continuous liquid interface production (CLIP).", "Increased interest in artificial intelligence coupled with a surge in nonvolatile memory research and the inevitable hitting of the \"memory wall\" in von Neuman computing1 has set the stage for a new flavor of computing systems to flourish: neuromorphic computing systems. These systems are modelled after the brain in hopes of achieving a comparable level of efficiency in terms of speed, power, performance, and size. As it becomes more apparent that digital implementations of neuromorphic systems are far from approaching the brain's level of efficiency, we look to nonvolatile memories for answers. In this paper, we will build up highly-efficient neuromorphic systems by first describing the nonvolatile memory technologies that make them work, exploring methodologies for overcoming statistical device faults, and examining several successful neuromorphic architectures.", "The purpose for this paper is to introduce the SPIE\u2019s semiconductor and biotechnology communities to the emerging and convergent frontier of Semiconductor- Synthetic Biology (SSB). The paper distills and briefly summarizes key messages from two seminal SSB related documents. The first edition of the Semiconductor Synthetic Biology Roadmap,1 published in 2018, laid out a vision for five high impact opportunity areas that complement and leverage the synergistic strengths of semiconductor based information processing technology and synthetic biology. This Roadmap reflects the cross-disciplinary contributions from experts in the physical sciences, health care and semiconductor technologies. A subsequent 2019 paper, by Bathe et. al.,2 elaborated on and further clarified targets for selected biomaterials and biological pathways for electronic nanofabrication. These works are catalyzing considerable research interest and, as with other roadmaps, e.g., the ITRS and IDRS, will tend to prioritize and focus investments in this area. This paper also offers a few early bioinspired SSB-related results with potential high impact that warrant consideration. Note: Throughout the paper, the quoted text comes from reference 1, i.e., the 2018 SemiSynBio Roadmap.", "Hydrogen Depassivation Lithography (HDL) is a version of electron beam lithography that uses scanning tunneling microscope (STM) instrumentation to expose a self\u2013developing resist that is a monolayer of H chemisorbed to a Si (100) 2x1 H-passivated surface. Developed in the 1990s it has been largely a laboratory tool used in research for nanofabrication. The technique is capable of atomic resolution, the ability to remove single H atoms from the Si surface and has much higher precision than the best conventional e-beam lithography can possibly achieve exposing polymeric resists. However, its most promising attribute is that it can be used as a digital fabrication tool and is the first of a class of nanofabrication techniques that can be considered digital atomic scale fabrication technologies. Digital Atomic Scale Fabrication can be shown to have similar advantages over analog fabrication techniques that digital information technology has over analog information technology.", "Hydrogen deppasivation lithography (HDL) carried out by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is used to make patterns of Si dimers on a hydrogen passivated silicon surface. In this paper we discuss a new STM mode of operation that is highly suitable for removing single H atoms from the surface. This is made possible by changes we have made to the STM feedback control system that allows the STM to remove hydrogen atoms without switching the operational mode from imaging to lithography. Employing this method can potentially reduce the chance of tip-sample crash and increase the lithography precision.", "The attachment of dopant precursor molecules to depassivated areas of hydrogen-terminated silicon templated with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has been used to create electronic devices with sub-nanometer precision, typically for quantum physics demonstrations, and to dope silicon past the solid-solubility limit, with potential applications in microelectronics and plasmonics. However, this process, which we call atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM), currently lacks the throughput required to develop sophisticated applications because there is no proven scalable hydrogen lithography pathway. Here, we demonstrate and characterize an APAM device workflow where STM lithography has been replaced with photolithography. An ultraviolet laser is shown to locally heat silicon controllably above the temperature required for hydrogen depassivation. STM images indicate a narrow range of laser energy density where hydrogen has been depassivated, and the surface remains well-ordered. A model for photothermal heating of silicon predicts a local temperature which is consistent with atomic-scale STM images of the photo-patterned regions. Finally, a simple device made by exposing photo-depassivated silicon to phosphine is found to have a carrier density and mobility similar to that produced by similar devices patterned by STM.", "Fabrication via self-assembly has been explored for its potential to overcome the challenges of feature size/density and stochastic variability facing conventional lithographic approaches. While methods such as diblock-copolymer directed self-assembly have trouble meeting defectivity and edge-placement specifications, techniques such as atomic layer deposition and self-aligned sidewall-spacer methods are standard. Using DNA origami as an example, I will discuss the conditions for simple systems to form low-defectivity structures, and the potential for self-assembling systems to create complex, hierarchical nanostructures, and their inherent limitation. I will comment on choosing the right applications for the initial introduction of bottom-up fabrication methods.", "DNA nanotechnology has shown great promise for nanopatterning applications thanks to the ability to nanoengineer rationally designed two and three-dimensional (3D) nano-objects of complex shapes with subnanometer precision and high degree of rigidity [1]. Recently, a self-assembled DNA origami allowing sub-10 nm pattern transfer into SiO2 has been demonstrated [2]. We report here a mechanistic study of a high resolution (10 nm) and high density (10 nm) DNA pattern transfer into a Si substrate. In order to exploit their full potential for lithographic application, the deterministic positioning of the DNA nanostructures on a predefined substrate is still a major challenge to overcome. In a second part of this paper, we present a hybrid nanopatterning process by combining locally chemically modified substrate by top-down technics with bottom-up self-assembly of DNA nanostructures in order to deterministically fix DNA origamis on the substrate. Chemical contrast is formed using conventional lithography in order to create DNA affine and adverse parts on the substrate. The pattern transfer of the DNA nanostructures in the inorganic under layer is demonstrated as well. Thus, DNA origami appears to be a promising emerging approach for the engineering of hard masks for patterning.", "A novel approach to selective electroless deposition of metal on non-conductive substrates was developed. Using an electroless copper process requires the non-conductive material to be catalysed prior to electroless deposition and this is typically carried out using a Pd-Sn colloidal catalyst. In the current work, a novel magnetic Fe3O4-Ag nanoparticle (NP) catalyst was used. The composite particles were obtained by a wet chemical method. The composition, particle size and crystal structure of the particles were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The magnetic properties were characterised by vibrating sample magnetometry whilst the catalytic activity towards formaldehyde oxidation (the key reaction in electroless copper deposition) was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry. Because this new catalyst is magnetic, a magnetic field gradient can be used to manipulate the catalyst NPs. A permanent magnet was attached to the constructed steel template so that a magnetic field gradient on the FR-4 laminate substrate surface was achieved. When the magnetic field was applied, the Fe3O4-Ag catalyst NPs were attracted only to the areas of maximum magnetic field gradient on the surface, leading to selective catalysation of the substrate. Subsequent electroless copper plating only occurred at the areas where the composite magnetic NPs were deposited, meaning that selective metallisation by applying a magnetic field was achieved. The width of the selectively metallised lines was 350\u00b120 \u03bcm.", "Harnessing the omnipresent radio frequency (RF) waves intend to explore the new diode technologies as they determine the frequency of operation and ultimately the power conversion efficiency. Recently, a considerable effort focused on performance, reliable and low-cost fabrication methods. Here, we report the fabrication of sub-20 nm co-planar, asymmetric and self-forming nanogap electrodes by adhesion lithography (a-Lith) as an alternative, low-cost and large-area patterning technique. Moreover, solution processing and rapid Flash Lamp Annealing (FLA) route employed to fabricate Schottky diodes. These diodes are having more than 104 On/Off ratio, low series resistance and junction capacitance due to the novel co-planar architecture and thus operating beyond 10 GHz. This paves the way to a radically new diode technology that has a huge impact on the IoT \u2013 Wireless Energy Harvesting (WEH) and RFID system.", "A single micro-electromechanical (MEMS) resonator can be shown to exhibit behaviors unexpected in a simple resonant structure. For small driving forces, the resonator displays typical simple harmonic oscillator response. As the driving force is increased, the resonator shows the slightly more complex, but well understood, Duffing response. Rather unexpected response behavior can appear when the resonator frequency is detuned by nonlinearity to where two oscillatory modes of the resonator begin to interact through nonlinear coupling due to an internal resonance. The paper focuses on how the resonator response changes as the internal resonance is approached in the operating parameter space and how that behavior is conveniently represented in a bifurcation diagram. This behavior is accurately captured by a generic mathematical model. We describe an analysis of the model which shows how this coupled response varies with the system and drive parameters, especially focusing on the nonlinear coupling strength between the two modes.", "We demonstrate the versatility of dielectric metasurfaces for spatiotemporal shaping of optical fields, and discuss fabrication and material constraints for their applications as flat, ultrathin optical elements across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.", "The design and fabrication of the ultra-miniature microlens array homogenizer using two-photon polymerization is presented in this paper. The flat-top laser beam shaper includes refractive type, diffuser type and microlens array homogenizer. The drawback of the refractive and diffuser type is that the uniformity on the homogenization plane is associated with the laser Gaussian beam profile. However, the microlens array homogenizer is independent of laser beam profiles. Therefore, the microlens array is employed for the laser beam shaper in this study. In the simulation, the incident Gaussian elliptical laser beam is successfully transformed into a homogenized rectangular distribution by the microlens array homogenizer. Because the flat-top beam distribution is in the range of micrometer (\u03bcm) level in this study, the pitch of the microlens array is reduced to tens of microns, which is not suitable for general machining. Therefore, 3D printing using two-photon polymerization fabrication without tool interference issues is utilized. Finally, the microlens array homogenizer is successfully fabricated. The ultra-miniature flat-top laser beam shaper can accomplish a uniform rectangular distribution of 220 \u03bcm X 300 \u03bcm, which can be applied for high precision applications such as laser processing, laser medical, and laser display.", "Since the 1970s, the cost of photolithography in IC manufacturing has reached nearly 70% of the total production cost. The cost of production lithography equipment has grown almost 160 times reaching ~$80M (193i scanner) and exceeding $200M (EUV scanner). Such high costs have caused a significant market concentration in equipment and chip manufacturing.\nHistorically, the projection exposure technology was developed on the foundation of geometrical optics. A projection mask was a magnified stencil of the projected pattern. To achieve resolution, extensive development efforts have been made to increase the projection optics numerical aperture (NA), reduce exposure wavelength, minimize distortions of the projection lens and destructive diffraction effects. Complicated and highly costly RETs (OPC, PSM, SMO etc.) are used to suppress distortions in the pattern image induced by diffraction and aberrations of the projection optics.\nSub-Wavelength Holographic Lithography (SWHL) is an unconventional imaging approach in photolithography that utilizes diffraction and interference effects to create high-quality images in photoresist, whilst decreasing exposure steps\u2019 cost, including higher resolution nodes. The ability to construct arbitrary wavefronts opens multiple opportunities like printing on various 3-D surfaces. The SWHL is capable of dramatic reduction of the lithography cost and opens new opportunities in 3D imaging. Two proof-of-concept exposure systems were designed and built to verify the SWHL capabilities: the first for imaging patterns with sub-wavelength resolution, the second for printing on 3D surfaces. The fidelity and computation efficiency of mask synthesis and RET algorithms were verified.", "We investigated the contribution ratio of process fidelity and beam accuracy in patterning with the multi-beam mask writing system. A beam pitch-related line edge profile may occur, which impacts on line edge roughness (LER) in the multi-beam writing system. The printability of beam image into the final etched pattern depends on the mask process, therefore, we need to understand quantitatively the printability of beam placement errors on LER with the actual mask process. We examined how the patterning characteristics are modified in each step of the mask process. The printability of beam placement errors largely depend on the period of errors, rather than the amplitude of errors. These results can optimize the writing strategy in multi-beam mask writing.", "The high-throughput EBM-mask writer, EBM-8000P has been developed for mature node mask market. The EBM-8000P inherits basic architectures from the previous EBM-8000 system, i.e. electron optics with 50kV acceleration voltage, 400A/cm2 current density, variable shaped beam (VSB), and also, user interface such as JOB control system, mask handling system, which are equivalent to our latest single electron beam mask writers.\nThe EBM-8000P has two models, the EBM-8000P/H, which is equivalent to the conventional EBM-8000, and the EBM-8000P/M, which aims for high throughput.\nThe mask-writing throughput depends largely on the beam shot size and the current density, based on the generation of mask nodes. The EBM-8000P/M achieves high throughput and enough accuracy for 45-20 node by enlarging the maximum shot size while maintaining a current density of 400A/cm2.\nTherefore, it is possible to achieve throughput that is 1.5 to 2 times faster than the conventional 70A/cm2 mask writer (such as EBM-6000) which is for 45-20nm node.", "SWHL Nanotech team have implemented effective algorithms and developed scalable software allowing to synthesize holographic masks for various lithography applications including MEMS, MOEMS and high-end IC production. Most of the technical problems of state-of-art projection photolithography such as 3D-imaging, quality optimization were stated and solved as a completely numerical problems in the case of holographic lithography approach. Nanotech SWHL team developed effective algorithms of the holographic mask synthesis based on FFT with the complexity of \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc41), which allowed to synthesize holographic masks for any IC layer. We developed the continuous phase-shifting optimization method based on WFS, DFS and gradient descent, in which a hologram is synthesized not for the original pattern, but for a pattern with altered amplitude and phase distribution. Like in other RET, the holographic mask synthesized for the properly altered pattern provides a much better-quality image of the original pattern. Thus, today it is possible to use modern computing clusters for the synthesis of holographic masks and to implement them in inexpensive and sustainable devices for holographic photolithography.", "Sub-Wavelength Holographic Lithography (SWHL) was introduced some years ago by Nanotech SWHL GmbH as a disruptive and promising method to replace projection photolithography. SWHL is based on principles of wave optics and uses a computer-generated hologram (CGH) as a photomask for both 2D and 3D imaging.\nTo proof the concept of SWHL first for sub-wavelength critical dimensions (CD) and then for non-flat imaging we designed two experimental optical set-ups. Both set-ups use commercially available 442nm He-Cd gas laser. The holographic masks were designed as a set of windows in an opaque chromium layer on a fused silica blank.\nThe imaging in SWHL does not require any projection optics. Thanks to this the optical system includes only the illuminator of the mask. The illuminator design is very simple, with just a few optical elements.\nTo demonstrate an image with sub-wavelength resolution, we use illumination with NA 0.53. For this NA we generated image with CD 250 nm that is 0.56 of the wavelength 442 nm.\nTo demonstrate 3D imaging capability the demonstration lab tool was developed. The tool provides the illumination of holographic mask with NA 0.24. The mask generated a multi-plane image with a depth of 100 \u03bcm and the image resolution of 2 \u03bcm.\nWe demonstrated both subwavelength and 3D holographic imaging in experiments and prove the concept of SWHL. All the experiments were made as computer simulations first. The comparison of the simulation and experimental results proved the reliability of our software.", "We propose a scheme of maskless holography as a base of a novel lithographic technic. Maskless schemes based on reflective SLMs with planar and non-planar layouts are considered. Several effective methods of phase hologram synthesis adapted to the layouts are also introduced. These methods are based on the holographic lithography approach and calculation algorithms that have been developed by Nanotech SWHL. The aim of the work is to find the proper scheme and SLM characteristics, e.g. micromirror size, flatness, dynamic stability, etc. The non-flat optical schemes based on array of reflective SLMs will allow to achieve high NA up to 0.9 without immersion. That investigation allows to design a photolithographic tool with high diffraction efficiency and high-end capabilities.", "Galileo Galilei once quoted: \u201cMeasure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so\u201d. In silicon manufacturing R&D phase, it often happens that engineers would like to access some parameter values that are not easy, even impossible to measure. When looking at a CDSEM image, the parameters of interest seem easy to extract but in practice getting access to them in a robust and reliable way is not always simple. Developing a contour-based metrology tool coupling robust contour extraction with a comprehensive contour metrology environment could help to bridge this gap. In previous works, it has been shown that SEM images contain significant amounts of information that can be extracted and analyzed using efficient contour extraction and analysis toolboxes [1, 2]. Also, the concept of implementing remote contour-based metrology has been introduced. The present work continues to unveil what can be achieved with such solutions. For that, the example of implant layers\u2019 process assumption will be explored. During this process step, counter doping problems can occur for example when the distance between layers deviates from nominal. Therefore, it is crucial for design rule control to measure some critical dimensions such as minimum distance between layers, corner rounding, slope, etc. However, given the characteristics of the different structures in the images, which may come from different layers and/or processes steps, the measurements are not straightforward to extract with standard CDSEM metrology algorithms. Moreover, recipes are complex to setup, measurements by themselves are not very stable, and usually an indirect determination of the key figure is performed. In this paper, we will show that multilayer contour-based metrology, mixing image contour and GDS layout, allows to overcome the previously mentioned difficulties, as well as to generate measurements that are not possible to be performed by using standard algorithms.", "In leading edge patterning processes, overlay is now entangled with CD including OPC residuals and stochastics. This combined effect is a serious challenge for continued shrink and can be characterized with an Edge Placement Error (EPE) budget containing multi-domain components: global and local CD, local placement errors, overlay errors, etch biases and OPC. EPE defines process capability and ultimately relates to device yield. Understanding the EPE budget leads to efficient ways to monitor process capability and optimize it using EPE based process control applications. We examine a critical EPE use case on a leading edge DRAM node. We start by constructing and verifying the EPE Budget via densely sampled on-product in-device local, global CD and Overlay metrology after the etch process step. EPE budget contributors are ranked according to their impact to overall EPE performance and later with simulated EPE performance improvements per component. A cost/benefit analysis is shown to help choose the most HVM-friendly solutions.", "In this paper we present a powerful virtual metrology system to aid in-fab product lot level dispositioning and yield learning. CD and overlay measurement data of different layers are modeled across the wafers and mapped to dense dose, focus, and overlay grids. These are input processing conditions for design-specific computational lithography to predict on full-wafer, full-chip inter-layer overlap area and critical edge-to-edge distances, which are thereafter used to predict electrical failure. The system is composed of an off-line inter-layer hotspot database and an on-line real time dispositioning module. It supports complex multi-patterning stacks with or without self-aligned processes. Example runs have been conducted for 14 nm node metal and via layers, using both FEM-like and typical nominal production wafer data, and the results are as expected from lithographical point of view. Comparing with traditional wafer dispositioning based on static overlay spec and CD spec, our system outputs wafer map stacked with failed dies locations, worst case hotspots contours, root cause analysis, list of worst hotspots and worst dies for inspection, and help litho engineer make an educated decision on wafer dispositioning. This will help fab optimize CD \u2013 Overlay process window, improve yield ramp, reduce wafer rework rate, and hence reduce cost, and shorten turn-around-time. The system\u2019s computation is fast and inline real time wafer dispositioning aided by computational lithography is made possible by the system.", "Optical overlay metrology has been used for years as the baseline for overlay control, measuring an optical target in the scribe line with optimized design to best match the on-product overlay. However, matching the optical target overlay measurements to the real on-product overlay becomes a serious challenge for most advanced technology nodes and forces the industry to develop different or complementary solutions. To identify and better quantify the different, well-known overlay accuracy detractors, in this work we have used optical and state-of-the-art electron beam technologies (eBeam) to measure on-product and on-optical target overlay errors of a wafer processed at imec using 5 nm technology node design rules and intentionally introduced overlay skews of +10 and -10 nm in x and y axis. The overlay errors as measured by the SEM eBeam system, equipped with elluminator\u2122 technology which enables fast see through measurements of overlay which has been compared with (X-sectional) STEM-HAADF reference overlay metrology data. The on-product and optical target SEM overlay measurements show very similar wafer maps, in line with the applied overlay errors during the lithography exposure step. eBeam and TEM data show excellent correlation for the on-product overlay errors and the eBeam data also reveal a significant bias of ~ 6 nm between on-product and on-target overlay errors. From these results it can be concluded that manufacturing of advanced devices which require accurate OPO control, will need new metrology strategies that combine eBeam and optical or, eventually, use only eBeam technologies to guarantee effective overlay control with sufficient accuracy.", "We present a different approach to laser-assisted atom probe tomography, where instead of using a near-UV laser for inducing a thermal transient, we use an extreme-ultraviolet coherent light source to trigger field ion emission at the tip's apex. The use of extreme-ultraviolet photons in atom probe tomography opens the potential for an athermalfield ionization pathway.", "In traditional 3D NAND design, peripheral circuit accounts for 20-30% of the chip real-estate, which reduces the memory density of flash memory. As 3D NAND technology stacks to 128 layers or higher, peripheral circuits may account for more than 50% of the overall chip area. On the contrast, the XtackingTM technology arranges array and logic parts on two different wafers, and connects the memory arrays to the logic circuit by metal VIAs (Vertical Interconnect Accesses) to achieve unprecedented high storage density as well as DRAM level I/O speed. As a consequence, it becomes increasingly significant to monitor metal VIAs depth before wafer bonding process as to ensure reliability of array-logic connections. Currently, AFM (Atom Force Microscopy) is the main stream method of VIA depth monitoring. Apparently, AFM wins the battle of precision, however the low throughput limited its usage in mass production. In order to accomplish the requirement of VLSI production, a WLI (White Light Interferometry) metrology is revisited and a novel neural network assisted method was developed to monitor VIA depth. Basically, there are two major limitations that keep WLI tools from wider use, transparent film impact and diffraction limitation. In this work, realization of neural network is illustrated and inline dishing measurement is achieved with high accuracy and precision.", "In order to extract ever more performance from semiconductor devices on the same device area, the semiconductor industry is moving towards device structures with increasingly complex material combinations and 3D geometries. To ensure cost effective fabrication of next generation devices, metrology solutions are needed that tackle the specific challenges that come from these developments such as 3 dimensional imaging of structures and imaging of deeply buried structures under arbitrary, complex layers. Compared to existing metrology solutions for high end manufacturing, ultrasonic inspection techniques have advantages: they are unaffected by optically opaque layers, the acoustic wavelength (60nm @ 100GHz in SiO2) can be smaller than optical wavelengths and the measurement depth can be larger. However, traditional acoustic microscopy tops out at a few GHz due to manufacturing tolerances and the required liquid couplant. We propose to combine very high frequency ultrasound with scanning probe microscopy. By locating the transducer above the cantilever tip, it guides sound into the sample with a dry tip-sample contact. This allows for very high acoustic frequencies and a resolution of O(wavelength).", "Semiconductor reliability in applications such as automotive is getting increased attention as design rules shrink to include 1Xnm, semiconductor content per vehicle continues to grow, applications become more critical and reliability requirements tighten. Current automotive requirements stipulate less than one defective part per million (DPPM). Approaches to address reliability include improving design, manufacturing and test. Process control in manufacturing is critical for reliability and includes continuous improvement for reducing process tool defectivity, excursion monitoring of process tools and product lines, golden or best performing tool methods [1], measurement system analysis (MSA) methods and screening. Inline defectivity is known to have an impact on both yield and reliability [2], and defects can impact reliability in one of two ways. Killer defects located in areas that are untested can result in so called Zero- Kilometer failures. In other cases, the same types of defects that cause yield loss can also cause latent reliability failures \u2013 the difference being size, location and density. Latent reliability defects become activated after test and can include defect types such as partial bridges, partial opens, and embedded particles. Current reliability engineering relies on outlier detection rules like parametric part average testing (P-PAT) [3], or geographic part average testing (G-PAT), both of which are derived from end-of-line screening data, which is based solely on electrical test data [4]. Inline Part Average Testing (I-PAT\u2122) is enabled by multi-channel high-speed LED scanning inspection technology and offers an opportunity to apply fab data to reliability engineering. Defect inspection results are analyzed with machine learning (ML) to weigh the defectivity and create a die-level defectivity metric allowing the statistical identification of die which are a high reliability risk [5, 6]. Two case studies are described. The first case is a feasibility study based on historical fab defectivity data and includes a sample of ~250,000 die, with eight inline defect inspections per wafer, including four front end of line (FEOL) and four back end of line (BEOL), on a high sensitivity broadband inspection system [7, 8]. Each defect is assigned a weight based on its impact to various \u201cground truth\u201d indicators. The combined impact of all defects in a given die stacked across all inspections is aggregated into a die-level metric. Plotting the die-level I-PAT metrics for all the die as a Pareto chart allows outliers to be identified using accepted statistical methods [9]. I-PAT metrics can then be correlated to electrical wafer sort (EWS) yield or fallout rate, specific wafer-sort bins, EWS parametric test performance and post burn-in electrical test. Of key importance is that wafer test was not used to train the I-PAT model, and therefore this method is an independent validation of latent reliability. The second case study focuses on production screening feasibility with multi-channel high-speed LED scanning, and addresses overkill, or the over inking of potentially good die based on inline defectivity, which is a critical challenge that must be overcome for production implementation [10]. Using inspection enabled by high speed LED scanning technology, die screening is a critical component of a comprehensive automotive Zero Defect program. Applications include early detection of fab excursions, feedback for continuous improvement of inline defectivity, feedforward to optimize electrical test methods and screening of die containing possible latent reliability defects. The I-PAT methodology can be used to enhance standard end-of-line outlier detection rules such as P-PAT [3], which is based solely on parametric testing.", "In order to successfully develop and manufacture semiconductor chips, in-line inspection is extremely important. Optical and e-beam inspection are the two major defect inspection approaches used for semiconductor manufacturing. As critical dimensions continue to shrink with each new technology, killer defects are becoming smaller and smaller, reducing the effectiveness of optical inspection, which is resolution limited. A growing number of defect types are just not detectable with optical inspection. A partial solution is to adjust inspection parameters to run \u201chot\u201d, but then the few defects of interest that are captured are buried in large numbers of nuisance defects. E-beam inspection (EBI), in addition to it\u2019s unique role of detecting buried defects using voltage contrast (VC), is able to detect these smaller defects, but suffers from throughput constraints. This is because of EBI\u2019s substantially smaller pixel size, which takes much longer to tile across the wafer surface, and a lower sampling frequency, because electrons aren\u2019t as prevalent as photons. In R&D, this is not as much of a limitation, with EBI commonly deployed as a metric for many physical defects beyond optical inspection resolution as well as lithography related use cases such as process window qualification (PWQ) and EUV print check. However, EBI\u2019s adoption during yield ramp and high volume manufacturing (HVM) is limited by these throughput constraints. To address this issue, HMI is developing multi-beam inspection (MBI) systems [1,2]. This latest paper covers three new topics. First, new milestones were achieved in the last year, including simultaneous operation of all beams and defect detection while in this mode, will be reviewed. Second, the importance of minimizing cross-talk between beamlets for MBI and the cross-talk performance of our latest tool is discussed. Finally, simulations of the anticipated throughput gains achievable for a range of physical and voltage contrast inspections for the current system are presented. These throughput gains vary widely and are useful in prioritizing certain inspections over others for practical use, as well as understanding the limiting factors for laggard inspections. Potentially some of these factors can be alleviated. Going forward, the plan is to continue to aggressively increase the number of beamlets while simultaneously further improving the resolution. Overall the HMI MBI program is on track with tool shipments to select customers in the very near future.", "It has long been observed that certain pattern-failure phenomena manifest in an apparent random manner on wafer. Thus for a design pattern featuring multiple identical repeats in identical surrounding environments, some locations will at certain processing conditions result in failure, whereas identical patterns in direct proximity might not exhibit failure. Two examples of such are sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) printing and aspect-ratio dependent pattern collapse. SRAFs are of course designed to not print on the wafer, but it is observed that when SRAFs of a certain size or proximity to the main feature, at a specific dose and focus condition, are first observed to print on wafer, they do so in a random manner. The clearest demonstration of this is for a simple grating pattern with long running simple 1D lines interspersed with uniformly sized SRAF on the mask. Depending upon the resist system polarity, it is common to see splotches of partially printed SRAF dimples in the photoresist, or residual scum of photoresist appearing randomly along the length of the SRAM location. This behavior can be ascribed to the cumulative stochastic effects of exposure, PEB, and develop. A more complex phenomenon is pattern-collapse, which has been thoroughly researched and shown to be related to non-uniform capillary forces acting upon the newly developed photoresist pattern as well as the profile and bottom CD of those patterns. The result can again be an apparent randomness to the toppling of patterns which are nominally identical, especially when layout and process conditions are right at the onset of failure observation. Early experimental work in characterizing these two phenomena were often based on simple SEM image analysis, and demonstrated perhaps parts per thousand sensitivity. More sophisticated optical imaging techniques such as E-beam inspection can achieve perhaps parts per million sensitivity. With the advent of EUV lithography, there has been increased attention on stochastic effects, owing to the relatively few number of photons involved in the exposure of a single pattern. The result has been improved experimental methodologies for characterizing stochastic phenomena such as micropinching or micro-bridging, as well as improved simulation of these random behaviors. For 7 nm and below, the required sensitivity to protect yield is less than parts per billion. In this work, we report on the use of stochastic models to quantify the prediction of SRAF printing and pattern-collapse through the process window. Simple grating patterns with variable sized single SRAFs are used for characterization of the failure rate expressed in terms of percent of total SRAF mask layout area in the design block. For pattern collapse simulation, an array of photoresist posts are utilized, and as a proxy for pattern collapse, we use bottom CD area calculated from the randomized simulated contour. We use a range of different stochastic models to represent variable degrees of stochastic contribution and show the impact on main feature line edge roughness (LER) as well as pattern failure. Examples are shown for both EUV and 193i cases, and it is highlighted that stochastic failure is not relegated solely to EUV.", "Appropriate solutions for post-lithographic defect management and process tool control are fundamental to ensure better chip quality and yield maintenance through the reduction of wafers at risk. The increasing demand in terms of wafer production capacity and sensitivity requirements from the automotive, MEMS and Internet of Things markets is leading advanced legacy semiconductor fabs to challenge their conventional after-develop-inspection (ADI) paradigm. In this work, we present a high throughput photolithography step monitoring scheme, developed by STMicroelectronics and KLA, employing an 8 Series patterned wafer defect inspection system for wafer frontside inspection and review. Namely, we demonstrate the capacity to capture die level defects together with full wafer excursions with a significant level of sensitivity, as well as a beneficial impact on yield improvement and lithography cell control. Moreover, we propose fast and reliable methods for monitoring the pattern shift and mask check, enabling increased wafer sampling and faster rework decisions. Lastly, we show well-engineered on-tool classification solutions at inspection runtime for each defect detected, allowing for improved control with high purity and fully automatic wafer disposition. Besides inline monitoring, we also show the capacity to check process tool performance, to detect lithography excursions faster and more effectively and have a better understanding of defectivity root causes. Moreover, to ensure complete control over the full lithography process, we show after-cleaning-inspection capabilities alongside conventional ADI. In this work, we present the beneficial aspects of the adopted strategy in terms of capacity improvement and critical defect detection in the production line.", "At sub10nm nodes of Backend of Line (BEOL) using Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL), the requirements of the process window of patterning are extremely tight for parameters such as Critical Dimension (CD) and Overlay which are traditionally managed for the semiconductor process. In addition to these parameters, because the latest BEOL pattern consists of a variety of space patterns, Edge Placement Error (EPE) of the tip feature of space pattern is the most critical to secure the contact between metal layer and contact or via layer. Because tip EPE is assumed to be affected by multiple factors such as pattern layout, the accuracy of Optical Proximity Correction (OPC), mask pattern, scanner tool conditions, and etching process conditions etc., the characterization of the patterning process and the establishing analysis method to find the root cause of EPE is of utmost importance before starting a high-volume manufacturing. However, general CDSEM metrology is only utilized to collect the limited number of data from several features which are predicted by simulation or searched by optical inspection tool. This implies the possibility of further process optimization is still covered inside of various 2D feature in BEOL. In this paper, we apply Die to Database(D2DB) EPE and show the necessity of massive data-based methodology to identify local process variability of 2D feature using e-beam metrology.", "An auto e-beam tilt technology was used to measure bottom critical dimensions (CD) of High-Aspect Ratio (HAR) contact holes. Results show that traditional Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is not capable of catching bottom information, such as bending structures. A new method with hardware and software has been developed to first find the best angle to detect bottom electron signals with high acceleration voltage and then synthesize with multi-angle electron signals. By using this method, accurate bottom CD as well as the angle and direction of bended hole can be measured automatically. It is very effective for inline metrology of HAR 3D structure in semiconductor wafer processing.", "We demonstrate the application of 3D tomography by FIB-SEM to analyze channel holes in 3D-NAND. We automatically analyze the 3D channel profiles for size, shape, and placement from the reconstructed full 3D volume. As the data contains thousands of holes, and each hole is sampled with a resolution of a few nanometer in 3D, this method provides a vast amount of data. We analyze individual holes as well as a full population of holes, from a solid statistical basis. Such information is beneficial in monitoring and controlling the etch process of the HAR channel holes in 3DNAND fabrication.", "We applied deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of 3D-profiling for high aspect ratio (HAR) holes. As deep learning requires big data for training, we developed a method for generating a large amount of BSE line-profiles by a numerical calculation in which the aperture angle and the aberration effects of the electron beam are considered. We then utilized these numerically calculated datasets to train the deep learning model to learn the mapping from the BSE line-profiles to the target cross-sectional profiles of the HAR holes. Two different one-dimensional neural network architectures: convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi-scale convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) were trained, and different loss functions were investigated to optimize the networks. The test results show that the MS-CNN model with a defined loss function of weighted mean square error (WMSE) provided higher accuracy than the others. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) distribution was narrow and the typical MAPE was 4% over 2810 items of test data. This model enables us to predict the cross-section of the HAR holes with different sidewall profiles more accurately than our previously proposed exponential model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the learning approach for improving the accuracy of 3D-profiling of the HAR features.", "Tilted channel holes affect final yield significantly in High Aspect Ratio (HAR) 3D NAND memory wafer processing. An in-line measurement method is developed to use machine learning that utilizes the spectra from optical metrology to map Tilt-X and Tilt-Y. Reliable reference is provided by high voltage SEM. Results show that the correlation of optical and HV e-Beam measurements has R2 more than 0.92. In addition, measurement throughput is improved tremendously by 40% from e-Beam to optical metrology. Combined with other optical metrology on the same platform (thickness, and Optical CD), this method is much efficient for in-line tilt measurement after channel hole etch process.", "Background: Understanding line-edge and linewidth roughness in semiconductor patterning requires accurate, unbiased measurements where noise in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image does not impact the measured roughness. This in turn requires edge detection algorithms with minimum sensitivity to SEM noise since unbiased roughness measurement does not allow the use of image filtering. Aim: There is a need to characterize and evaluate the noise sensitivity of edge detection algorithms used in SEM metrology. Approach: The noise floor of the roughness power spectral density will be used as a metric of noise sensitivity to compare three edge detection algorithms (derivative, threshold, and Fractilia Inverse Linescan Model (FILM)) using three sets of images (low-noise, mid-noise, and higher-noise cases). Results: The derivative edge detection algorithm performed poorly even on low-noise images. The threshold algorithm worked well only on the low-noise images. For all levels of noise in the images, the FILM algorithm performed well, and better than the threshold and derivative methods. Conclusions: An approach to unbiased roughness measurement that requires measurement of the noise floor without the use of image filtering requires an edge detection algorithm with inherently low noise sensitivity. The testing approach used here, comparing the noise floor level for different algorithms applied to the same images, is an effective way to evaluate the inherent noise sensitivity of edge detection algorithms.", "Line edge roughness (LER) measurement of a nanoscale line pattern is a metrology challenge in the inspection of semiconductor devices. Conventional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a classical LER measurement technique, is a top-view (2D) metrology and incapable of accurately measuring 3D structures. For LER measurements, SEM measurement generates a single line edge profile for the 3D sidewall roughness, although the line edge profile differs at each height in the 3D sidewall. In this study, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) with the tip-tilting technique to measure the 3D sidewall roughness, as an LER reference metrology. An identical location of a line pattern measured by SEM and AFM was compared to evaluate the SEM\u2019s performance. The line edge profile from the AFM measurement exhibited lower noise than that from SEM. The measured line edge profiles were analyzed using the power spectral density (PSD), height-height correlation function (HHCF), and autocorrelation function. The results demonstrate that the standard deviation (\u03c3) and correlation length (\u03be) are overestimated while the roughness exponent (\u03b1) is underestimated by SEM, considering the AFM results as reference values.", "The different typical noise components observed in SEMs are important aspects to image quality and thus performance, yet models for adding realistic noise to model-generated images is an area where improvement of SEM simulation is important for addressing critical IC industry applications. Understanding how realistic factors affect the achieved noise distribution is important to achieve realistic noise characteristic fidelity in simulated images with respect to experimental images. Achieving realistic noise is important to enable simulations to help address many industry issues, such as minimizing line edge roughness measurement uncertainty. In this work, JMONSEL will be used to simulate various test structures with many repeats to observe how the noise distribution changes spatially, which will allow us to understand the noise dependencies on material and local geometry, which should give insight into the possible need for more detailed attention to how noise is applied to analytically-generated images.", "EUV resist characterizations for line and space patterning as a function of dose and illumination conditions for varying pitches down to 28 nm are discussed. The unintentional resist line top loss (LTL) after development has been monitored and analyzed for all experimental conditions. Furthermore, line top roughness (LTR) is introduced, which is a 3\uf073 stochastic metric characterizing in-plane roughness related to the top of the resist lines. The main characterization technique employed for this study is atomic force microscopy (AFM) with novel probing algorithms as well as novel tips with diameters down to 5 nm and aspect ratios of 10:1. Additionally, results acquired by critical dimension scanning electron microscopy and optical critical dimension scatterometry are presented. It was found that the unintentional LTL is resist- and pitch-dependent and can be higher than 9 nm at 16 nm half-pitch but does not correlate with line break defect density results. However, LTR measurements of small area scans at dense line/space pitches may be used to draw conclusions about line break defect densities and hence yield. The resist specific metrics, LTR and LTL, allow for fast and early-on evaluation of new chemical formulations and help to forecast pitch- and dose-dependent performance. Furthermore, the results can be used to improve resist model accuracy for optical proximity correction calculations.", "We propose a methodology for the mathematical and quantitative characterization of the deviation of rough line/space patterns from their ideal smooth shape to identify defects related to line mass and shape. The methodology is applied in real AFM images of line/space patterns while a modelling framework is elaborated for the generation of rough line/space patterns with controlled top and sidewall roughness and size variations. We also explore the consequences of the proposed methodology in the metrology of LER and its relation to 3D patterns.", "With the ever increasing demand for higher transistor density and improved functionality, the nanostructures on modern semiconductor chips become more and more complex and their modeling requires a multitude of parameters. As a result, the performance of scatterometry as state-of-the-art optical inspection tool is limited by insufficient sensitivities towards certain parameters and high cross-correlations between them. In order to improve the model-based reconstruction, it is essential to generate as many uncorrelated datasets as possible. In this paper, we propose to combine conventional Fourier scatterometry with Mueller polarimetry and white-light interferometry to measure both angle- and wavelength-resolved Mueller matrices. This approach takes advantage simultaneously of the most relevant information channels of the light field: intensity, wavelength, phase, propagation angle, and polarization. We validate the performance improvement in case of multi-parameter problems by means of a comprehensive simulation study. In general, both the measurement uncertainties and the cross-correlations are reduced in comparison to other scatterometric configurations. Furthermore, our approach facilitatesthe reconstruction of target asymmetries, such as asymmetric sidewall angles, or the analysis of isolated line gratings at low technology nodes. Aiming at an experimental validation as well, we finally show results from first proof-of-principle measurements performed during the ongoing setup implementation.", "The three-dimensional architectures for field effect transistors (FETs) with vertical stacking of Gate-all-Around Nanowires provide a pathway to increased device density and superior electrical performance. However, the transition from research into manufacturing will only be successful if their feature shape, critical dimensions, and associated electrical performance are repeatable across the integrated circuit, across the wafer, and among multiple wafers. Patterning process control for these structures will require significant advances in metrology. Two techniques that are potential candidates for this purpose are Mueller Matrix Spectroscopic Ellipsometry based Scatterometry (MMSEscatterometry) and Critical Dimension Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (CDSAXS). In this work, we highlight the characterization of the Nanowire Test Structures fabricated from patterned Si/SixGe1-x/Si/SixGe1-x/Si/SixGe1-x/Si structures using CDSAXS. Preliminary experimental data shows sensitivity to the selective etching of subsurface SixGe1- x. CDSAXS diffraction data provides information in reciprocal space about line shape and periodicity as well as the amount of subsurface etching. Side lobes in the Intensity vs. Qz (structure height) data are observed around Qz positions of around 0.15 nm-1 and 0.5 nm-1 and are at the same positions in the measured and the simulated data for different amounts of SixGe1-x etch in the Nanowire Test Structures. This demonstrates its ability for successful measurement of the critical dimensions and 3D profile of the Nanowire Test Structures, which can then be extended to monitor several key process steps for Nanowire/Nanosheet FET fabrication.", "In this contribution nanoscale gratings are characterized by means of broadband EUV spectroscopy with wavelengths from 10 nm to 15 nm. The study focuses on the specifics of this spectral range that can be beneficial for metrology applications in lithography. Experimental investigations are carried out on fused silica nanoscale line gratings in a stand-alone laboratory-based setup. A corresponding sensitivity study is carried out analyzing the influence of grating parameter variations on EUV reflectance curves. Subsequently, experimental uncertainties are propagated to accuracies of grating parameter extraction. Using rigorous simulations in combination with machine learning, limitations of the technique are discussed regarding industrially relevant gratings. Extending the method through analysis of higher diffraction orders is evaluated.", "The native self-alignment of area-selective deposition (ASD) processes makes this technology a promising solution for precise pattern positioning in the EUV era. The key challenge for any ASD process is its defectivity associated with the deposition on the growth-inhibiting surface. Therefore, the ability to qualify an ASD process using the appropriate set of in-line metrology tools is crucial for up-scaling of the technology. In this work, we present a new concept of area-selective ALD TiO2 growth and use it as an example to show the potential of in-line OCD and XPS tools for evaluation of ASD processes. The proposed novel process is based on selective growth of TiO2 on top of SiO2/SiN in the presence of plasma halogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) acting as a growth-inhibiting layer. The exposure of a-C:H to CF4 or Cl2 plasma results in formation of a thin halogen-rich film suppressing nucleation of TiO2, while the latter is minimally affected on the plasma treated SiNx or SiO2 layers. The selectivity was assessed on both blanket films and 45 nm half-pitch a-C:H line patterns. The analysis of blanket a-C:H substrates showed that the plasma chlorination provides a substantially more efficient growth inhibition as compared to the fluorination. However, the ability of the CF4-plasma to etch the topmost surface of the a-C:H makes it more favorable for application on a-C:H patterns, surface of which is typically contaminated with residues from hard-mask or from the patterning plasma. Therefore, the pre-cleaning of the a-C:H line pattern surface with CF4-plasma is required to restore the growth blocking efficiency of the chlorinated a-C:H.", "Line-edge roughness (LER) is often measured from top-down critical dimension scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM) images. The true three-dimensional roughness profile of the sidewall is typically ignored in such analyses.\nWe study the response of a CD-SEM to sidewall roughness (SWR) by simulation. We generate random rough lines and spaces, where the SWR is modelled by a known power spectral density. We then obtain corresponding CD-SEM images using a Monte Carlo electron scattering simulator.\nWe find the measured LER from these images, and compare it to the known input roughness. We find that, for isolated lines, the SEM measures the outermost extrusion of the rough sidewall. The result is that the measured LER is up to a factor 2 less than the true on-wafer roughness. The effect can be accurately modelled by making a top-down projection of the rough edge. Our model for isolated lines works fairly well for a dense grating of lines and spaces, as long as the trench width exceeds the line height.", "In recent years semiconductor manufacturers have increasingly employed deep through-silicon via (TSV) at the front end of line (FEOL) process steps, combined with using an increased number of multilevel, three-dimensional (3D) layers with different material stack at the back end of line (BEOL) process steps. This increased usage results in enhanced requirements for 3D feature characterization during the process development steps, as well as with monitoring and failure analysis during production.\nTraditionally, deep TSV features during the FEOL are analyzed by cleaving (breaking) the wafers and observing the cross section. At the BEOL, focused ion beam (FIB) cross section and etch back or chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of layer-by-layer are used to characterize the 3D multilevel layers. Both methods result in a slow turnaround time (TAT), but most importantly, cross section analysis only gives two-dimensional (2D) information about 3D multilevel structure and can miss abnormalities. Etch back or CMP has relatively low quality, accuracy, and repeatability and results in full wafer scrap.\nInline Xe plasma FIB (PFIB) has become an important tool for 3D feature characterization and failure analysis in the chip manufacturing production line. Layer-by-layer excavation (also known as delayering) of a specific site provides enhanced metrology and reconstruction of complete 3D features. Thus, manufacturers can identify process abnormalities of the complete structure. Moreover, inline delayering, combined with cross sectioning of specific sites, enhances the TAT. The wafer can return to production for further analysis, and manufacturers can study the effects on different steps.", "When manufacturing a semiconductor device having a three-dimensional structure, grasping the positional relationship between the upper and lower structures is important. Our \u201cDig & See\u201d technology using GFIS-SIM enables such a device to be processed and its lower layers observed by quickly switching ion beams. With this technology, the digging of only the narrow areas of interest expedites delayering. Moreover, the structure of the lower layer can be exposed by top-down delayering and observed without using another tool. Unlike with other methods, the position of the lower layer can be determined with reference to the upper layer position.", "As development of stacked Nanosheet Gate All-Around (GAA) transistor continues as the candidate technology for future nodes, several key process points remain difficult to characterize effectively. With the GAA device strategy, it is critical to have an inline solution that can provide a readout of physical dimensions that have an impact on the threshold voltage (VT) and yield. Metrology challenges for obtaining these metrics arise from increasingly dense arrays coupled with both high aspect ratios, high numbers of correlated parameters, and increasingly complex 3D geometries. Large area metrology structures can be used for 3D parameters\u2019 process monitoring through techniques such as scatterometry and xray diffraction (XRD) which deliver averaged results over that area, but variation impacting specific devices cannot currently be understood without destructive cross-section. Prior work to characterize the dimensions of these GAA devices has primarily featured optical metrology, X-ray metrology, and critical-dimension scanning electron microscopy (CDSEM), but these techniques have their own challenges at the critical process points. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) had not been utilized due to the aspect ratios and small trench widths which were inaccessible to conventional techniques. However, due to recent advances in scanning and novel probe technologies, AFM is well-suited now to solve these local, three-dimensional challenges. Through this study, we demonstrate AFM characterization of a key process point in the GAA process flow for multiple structures with varying channel lengths, after epitaxial (epi) growth along the Si sidewall. The AFM scan results are compared to CDSEM images for top-down corroboration of topography and to other reference metrology for height correlation. The impact of measured variations in epi height to device performance is also reviewed.", "Node to node design rule are shrinking to enable better performance envelope in storage, computing power and electrical usage. A major part of every technology development is verification of the actual device overlay for thick stacks. Today the IC manufactures utilize TEM, Fib and other methods to understand the impact of overlay for thick stacks. These methods, which are considered as a \u201cground truth\u201d of the fab, can give very good resolution of the features shape characteristics, material contrast, metrology and defectivity. That said, some are destructive and have long time to results. Another approach for thick stack is to use eBeam high kV landing with elluminator technology, this enables fast see through measurements of overlay, yet this approach has also limitation where layer stack thickness exceeds see through imaging capability while chipmakers still require seeing the bottom layer to measure the overlay. In this paper, we propose a flow of accurate in-line runtime delayer method flowed by an eBeam elluminator technology for overlay verification as an extension of current eBeam measurement capabilities. This flow can be complimentary for different applications space where there\u2019s imaging limitation of the eBeam. The excellent local delayer control enables shorter time to root cause, process and design verification metrology (as a \u201cgolden ruler\u201d) in runtime fab. The work is based on IMEC frontend wafer at source drain Implant process steps after Hard Mask Etch. Looking at device features we explore the accuracy of new flow in sampling fins, dummy gate and Hard mask openings for implant process steps. Reference eBeam metrology will verify the accuracy of the delayer metrology.", "Dual beam focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) is a key characterization technique for rapid process development of electronic devices with complex geometry such as magnetic read/write heads in hard disk drives (HDD).

To overcome the throughput limitation of this technique and minimize the impact on product shipment time, it is a common practice to have a fleet of FIB/SEM tools in line. Hence, controlling the total measurement uncertainty (TMU) for the reference metrology fleet is essential. However, the existing TMU evaluation methods are mainly developed for non-destructive or less-destructive metrology techniques, which allows measurement repetition.

This technique is widely used for the wafer metrology of nanostructured surfaces in the semiconductor industry. There are two scatterometric approaches: angle-resolved and spectroscopic scatterometer.1, 2 Angle-resolved scatterometry involves single-wavelength readings at various angles, and measure both zeroth-order and first order diffractions. Spectroscopic systems work at a fixed angle of incidence but in broadband wavelengths range in the visible or UV, and measure only the zeroth-order diffraction. In contrast to angle-resolved and spectroscopic scatterometries, the proposed extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scatterometer is designed to measure the intensity of non-zero-order diffractions at a fixed incident angle and at multiple laser-like wavelengths. The short wavelengths of EUV, which give rise of several diffraction orders of scattering from nanoscale grating features. The well-separated higher-order diffraction beams are more informative than the zero-order diffraction beam, coupled with a very efficient rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA), can achieve a detailed reconstruction of the profile of nanoscale periodic gratings. In this paper, however, describes the use of yet two more methods for breaking correlations and increasing sensitivity\u2014include the use of non-zeroth order (m = + 1 and m = \u22121) diffracted light and polychromatic wavelengths of high harmonic generation (HHG). For many structures, this flexibility significantly increases parameter sensitivity and reduces parameter correlation.", "Beyond the 5nm technology node, interconnect scaling has an impact on metal material selection: usage of copper may hit a limit with respect to resistance and reliability performance [1]. Thickness of barrier and liner (required for copper) cannot be reduced further, meaning that trench width reduction will have a negative effect on the relative copper volume. Grain boundary scattering increases as well, which in turn further increases resistivity and resistance. One of the best alternatives is Ruthenium (Ru), but dual-damascene processing is difficult with Ru (requires improvements in Ru filling of narrow high aspect ratio trenches and in Ru CMP selectivity and defects). So, a Back End of Line (BEOL) material change may require a move to a semi-damascene integration with direct Ruthenium metal etch [2]. This shift from a well-known dual-damascene flow, based on metal CMP, to a semi-damascene flow, based on metal etch integration, will require a new set of metrology capabilities, which are studied in this paper. In the current study, Scatterometry is widely used in all semi-damascene process steps to monitor both dimensional and material properties. Important measured parameters include thickness, full profile details, grain size, and roughness of metal lines\u2014all parameters that are required for feedback and in-line process control. We will describe how these parameters can be monitored using a single Scatterometry metrology system. The semi-damascene process development described in this paper exploits EUV lithography at a critical dimension (CD) of 16 nm and 32 nm pitch and includes the optimization of the following process steps: 1. Metal deposition techniques: ALD and PVD, with a wide range of metal thickness. 2. Anneal , affecting grain size. 3. Etch process , for optimal metal line profile and roughness. The Scatterometry results were evaluated and verified by reference techniques such as CDSEM, and HAADF-STEM. The goal of the process optimization was Ru resistivity and resistance. In-line Scatterometry was shown to accurately predict the resistance of the Ru lines \u2014 parameter that is measured at the end of the processing, and is affected by all processes, including deposition, annealing, and etch. Prediction was carried out by a machine learning algorithm, based on an E-test, combining the contribution of all three process steps into a single output, at the post-etch measurement phase.", "As the lithographically manufactured nanostructures are shrinking in size, conventional techniques, such as microscopies (SEM, AFM) reach their resolution limits. We have developed a high-performance Grazing Incidence SAXS simulation tool to reconstruct the in-depth profile highly ordered material such as line gratings [1, 2]. Here, we will present the latest development and applications of the technique using x-rays to characterize line gratings and contact holes. Specifically, we will show how the CD-GISAXS approach has been extended to extract the in-depth profile dispersion of the lines, leading to a quantification of the line edge roughness. Finally, by introducing a recent study which harnessed the chemical sensitivity provided by soft x-ray scattering to extract latent image profiles from resists [3], we highlight new applications for this technique with high potential.", "Recent studies for profile reconstructions of nanostructures produced with self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) indicate the limits for solving the inverse problem with a rigorous simulation. Using Monte Carlo methods for the theoretical investigation of the observed pitchwalk behaviour is not feasible due to the high computational cost of simulating GISAXS measurements by solving Maxwell\u2019s equations with an FEM approach for each proposed structural model. We will show that a surrogate model based on a polynomial chaos expansion is a versatile tool to reduce the computational effort significantly. The expansion provides not only a surrogate for the forward model, but also Sobol indices for a global sensitivity analysis. This enables the study of the sensitivities in GISAXS in detail.", "Accurate, optics-based measurement of feature sizes at deep sub-wavelength dimensions has been conventionally challenged by improved manufacturing, including smaller linewidths, denser layouts, and greater materials complexity at near-atomic scales. Electromagnetic modeling is relied upon heavily for forward maps used to solve the inverse problem of optical measurements for parametric estimation. Machine learning (ML) approaches are continually under consideration, either as a means to bypass direct comparison to simulation or as a method to augment nonlinear regression. In this work, ML approaches are investigated using a well-characterized experimental data set and its simulation library that assumes a 2-D geometry. The benefits and limitations of ML for optical critical dimension (OCD) metrology are illustrated by comparing a straightforward library lookup method and two ML approaches, a data-driven surrogate model for nonlinear regression using radial basis functions (RBF) and multiple-output Gaussian process regression (GPR) that indirectly applies the simulated intensity data. Both RBF and GPR generally improve accuracy over the conventional method with as few as 32 training points. However, as measurement noise is decreased the uncertainties from RBF and GPR differ greatly as the GPR posterior estimate of the variance appears to overestimate parametric uncertainties. Both accuracy and uncertainty must be addressed in OCD while balancing simulation versus ML computational requirements.", "CD measurements of advanced 3D-NAND Staircase process require development of new approaches in CD metrology [1]. The current CD SEM Contact Analysis used for 3D-NAND assumes that process control could be provided through a set of geometric parameters defining the contact shape (i.e. parameters of contact shape elliptic fit such as equivalent contact top diameter (Top CD), equivalent contact bottom diameter (Bottom CD), ellipticity, minor, major axis). The limitation of this approach for process control of complex structures was considered, and a new approach based on Grey Level Analysis of contact features in SEM images was proposed. However, this analysis is not enough for controlling the complicated 3D-NAND Staircase formation process steps, as contact holes with same geometric parameters but different depths cannot be separated by traditional CD SEM metrology measurement procedure (Figures 1 and 2). Thus, traditional CD SEM approach needs revisiting in order to work in situations where process control requires analysis of sophisticated Grey Level uniformity distribution. We propose a novel approach combining traditional metrology with machine learning methods. The essence of this new approach is to combine Grey Level attributes and traditional CD measured geometric parameters of the feature, obtained by traditional CD metrology flow, in a classification scheme (Figures 2 and 3). The proposed approach was qualified at Micron site demonstrating ~98% purity classification results.\nThe proposed approach is generic and can be extended to a large variety of process control applications. Enhancing regular metrology flow with the capability to classify Etch process quality eliminates the need for the expensive and destructive cross-sectional SEM analysis. Furthermore, this method has a clear advantage during the early R&D phase of process development as it increases the usefulness of the in-line metrology tool while the process is still immature and unstable.", "Machine learning (ML) techniques have been successfully deployed to resolve optical metrology challenges in semiconductor industry during recent years. With more advanced computing technology and algorithms, the ML system can be improved further to address High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) requirements. In this work, an advanced ML eco-system was implemented based on big data architecture to generate fast and user-friendly ML predictive models for metrology purposes. Application work and results completed by using this ML eco-system have revealed its capability to quickly refine solutions to predict both external reference data and to improve the throughput of conventional Optical Critical Dimension (OCD) metrology. The time-to-solution has been significantly improved and human operational time has also been greatly reduced. Results were shown for both front end and back end of line measurement applications, demonstrating good correlations and small errors in comparison with either external reference or conventional OCD results. The incremental retraining from this ML eco-system improved the correlation to external references, and multiple retrained models were analyzed to understand retraining effects and corresponding requirements. Quality Metric (QM) was also shown to have relevance in monitoring recipe performance. It has successfully demonstrated that with this advanced ML eco-system, streamlined ML models can be readily updated for high sensitivity and process development applications in HVM scenarios.", "A methodology of obtaining the local critical dimension uniformity of contact hole arrays by using optical scatterometry in conjunction with machine learning algorithms is presented and discussed. Staggered contact hole arrays at 44 nm pitch were created by EUV lithography using three different positive-tone chemically amplified resists. To introduce local critical dimension uniformity variations different exposure conditions for dose and focus were used. Optical scatterometry spectra were acquired post development as well as post etch into a SiN layer. Reference data for the machine learning algorithm were collected by critical dimension scanning electron microscopy (CDSEM). The machine learning algorithm was then trained using the optical spectra and the corresponding calculated LCDU values from CDSEM image analyses. It was found that LCDU and CD can be accurately measured with the proposed methodology both post lithography and post etch. Additionally, since the collection of optical spectra post development is non-destructive, same area measurements are possible to single out etch improvements. This optical metrology technique can be readily implemented inline and significantly improves the throughput compared to currently used electron beam measurements.", "In multi patterning processes, overlay is now entangled with CD including OPC and stochastics. This combined effect is a serious challenge for continued shrink and is driving down the allowed overlay margin to an unprecedented level. We need to do everything to improve overlay where accurate measurement and control of wafer deformation is extremely important. This requires accuracy in overlay metrology that decouples target asymmetry from wafer deformation. Multiwavelength diffraction-based overlay (DBO) is positioned for providing such accuracy while maintaining the required measurement speed. At the same time, with the increase of process complexity in advanced nodes, several new types of target asymmetries are introduced. Some of such asymmetries vary even within the target / grating area (intra-grating) and some are so severe that it impacts the center of gravity shift of the overlay target.", "As the industry moves from node to node, lithographers have been pushed to use complex models to correct overlay errors and drive down model residuals. High order models are now used in combination with Correction per Exposure capabilities for critical layers on immersion scanners [1]. Mean overlay intrafield signatures are linked to the reticles (current and reference) and illuminations used, therefore the intrafield High Order Process Correction (iHOPC) model should be as stable as possible in terms of correction parameters. However, iHOPC data shows that the overlay parameters can drift over time and a Run to Run can follow these slow drifts. IHOPC R2R integration in production overlay correction flow is discussed in this paper: How corrections are generated from overlay measurement? What metrics are used to secure the model application? What results on production lots can be achieved? Then, a focus is made on the model variability. To operate properly, the R2R needs a high frequency variability as low as possible. Some factors like scanner lens aberration correction, metrology tool matching, measurement layouts, have been found to have an impact on lot-to-lot variability. These effects will be investigated in this paper to provide a conclusion on the usage of an iHOPC R2R for mean overlay intrafield signatures.", "Reducing the overlay error between stacked layers is key to enabling higher pattern density and thus moving towards high performance and more cost effective devices. However, as for specific applications like macrochips with photonic interconnects and high-resolution image sensor flat panels with advance polarizers, customers require product field sizes that are larger than the maximum field size available on scanners. Those large fields are obtained by stitching together multiple standard fields. The overlay performances between two adjacent dies are as aggressive as what is usually required between two stacked layers. For this application, the well-established polynomial overlay model is not suitable as the displacement is measured relatively and the metrology sampling in the field is such that some high order nonlinear (K) terms cannot be modeled independently. Furthermore, a perfect grid is needed in mix and match production. The intrafield correction capability of the exposure tool is not the same for each process steps. For example, no intrinsic K13 can be printed for a mix and match process flow that includes an Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) litho step. In addition, some KrF scanners with fewer lens manipulators cannot correct for K9. Measuring the stitching and correcting it at the first layer will prevent printing K terms that are not correctable later in the process. In this paper, the need to characterize and control single-layer overlay among different pattern placement mechanisms intrinsic to the scanner was studied: optical aberrations, field-to-field position, mask placement and registration. An ASML set-up BP-XY-V3 reticle was used to generate a large experimental dataset to validate stitching models supported by Overlay Optimizer (OVO). Overlay measurements were done Resist-in-Resist using new YieldStar (YS) interlaced stitching Diffraction Based Overlay (\u03bcDBO) targets that were designed and validated. This paper will present on product metrology results of a scatterometry-based platform showing production results with focus not only on precision and on accuracy, but also assessing target performance and target-to-target delta without process influence. A high order stitching model was developed and verified on a Multi-Product Reticle for a large device application. Trench width control at the field intersection was studied then optimized with proximity correction to ensure a perfect field-to-field junction.", "Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a proven technique applied in research environments, most commonly in materials science and biological research. More recently, requirements in semiconductor manufacturing advocate that probe microscopy has potential to assist with the new metrology techniques associated with device scaling and the corresponding increase in 3D structures. In this paper a novel form of AFM called the Rapid Probe Microscope (RPM) will be demonstrated operating at high data acquisition rates; with images collected in seconds, combined with the ability to characterise individual 3D structures with sub nanometre accuracy. The capability of the RPM will be illustrated by measuring a suite of 2D EUV posts of 26nm dimension in staggered topology with 40nm minimum pitch. These structures were developed as part of IMEC\u2019s EUV lithography patterning development program. The high throughput of the RPM enables the collection of multiple site and multiple pitch data, from a focused exposure matrix. Automated batch processing tools have been developed to enable the effective analysis of the high volume of data produced. The data can then be extensively interrogated to fully understand how the structure of the posts is related to the lithography process. In addition to a statistical analysis of the entire pillar population, the analysis tools can isolate and measure each individual pillar, providing the ability to compare the height and shape on an isolated pillar by pillar bases.", "On Product Overlay (OPO) is a critical budget for advanced lithography. LithoInSight (LIS), an ASML application product, has proven to improve the ability of advanced process control (APC) for overlay with accurate fingerprint estimation and optimized scanner correction. It is now often used as Process of Record (PoR) for performing chuck/lot based run-to-run (R2R) control in a High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) environment. In order to further improve the on-product performance given the ever-tightening overlay spec. in advanced nodes, the question of how to reduce wafer-to-wafer process-induced variation has been asked frequently. Studies have shown that the wafer-to-wafer overlay variation is driven by certain critical process contexts. Aiming to bring a solution to the HVM phase, the ASML and Micron Data Science teams developed a Wafer Level Grouping Control (WLGC) methodology to perform overlay control given the process context information. This methodology has been implemented in one of the Micron production fabs, and demonstrated both reduced wafer-to-wafer (W2W) overlay variation and improved device yield on a yield-critical layer for a product from Micron 1z DRAM node.", "On product overlay (OPO) challenges are quickly becoming yield limiters for the latest technology nodes, requiring new and innovative metrology solutions. In this paper we will cover current and future overlay trends in logic and memory device processing. We will review new lithography overlay challenges and node-after-node trends in the OPO error budget for advanced logic, DRAM, and 3D NAND devices. The central question of this paper is whether optical overlay metrology can keep up with challenges that include accuracy, intra-field variability, target-to-device offset, and others. After surveying the two dominant technologies in optical overlay metrology (IBO and SCOL\u00ae), we will outline innovative solutions that will help to address metrology challenges for the new device nodes.", "As a follow-up to last year\u2019s \u201cWhat is prevalent CD-SEM's role in EUV era?\u201d [1], here we report our ongoing progress on total metrology solutions for the sub-10-nm extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography process. We discuss two technical approaches that have emerged following our previous work. First, similar to conventional minimization processes, we focus on improvements in the top metrology task, down-to-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m-order tool matching, namely, \u201catomic matching\u201d, which is a crucially important feature in all in-line metrology tools in the EUV era. Second, we examine a comprehensive solution that enables EUV-characterized featured process monitoring with greater accuracy, higher speed, and smarter metrology.", "This study explores SEM induced shrink on EUV resist at different SEM scanning conditions from traditional to low landing energies. Measurement results of different targets, constant space of 28 nm and different pitches, across FEM wafer demonstrate both charging and resist shrink impact on measurement sensitivity and uncertainty. AFM measurements, SEM vs fresh locations are performed to quantify 3D morphology changes of the EUV pattern.", "Process monitoring of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresist requires critical dimension analysis and careful control of extracted parameters like line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR). Automated SEM metrology typically provides estimates for these parameters, including critical dimensions and \u201cshape, \u201d but at the cost of SEM exposure modifying the shape and size of the material systems. A method for acquiring and analyzing dense line structures using TEM tomography is proposed. Automation of the process from in-fab photoresist encapsulation through dual-beam lamella preparation to tomography acquisition is described, followed by a discussion of novel methods for volumetric reconstruction with metrology. Measurement capabilities are compared to CDSEM and AFM. Novel three-dimensional constructs illustrating process and property relationships in the lithography module are provided.", "In order to meet the tightened lithography performance requirement for EUV systems, a good on-product focus control with accurate metrology is essential. In this manuscript we report on a novel metrology solution for the EUV on-product focus measurement using YieldStar. The new metrology has been qualified on the Logic product wafers and when combined with the advanced techniques and algorithm shows a performance that is accurate and precise enough to meet EUV requirements. Furthermore, the new methodology provides the opportunity for on-product focus monitoring and control through different scanner interfaces. Here we present a case in which the Imaging Optimizer using the EUV metrology data shows an improvement of over 20% on the focus uniformity.", "Shrinking design rule coupled with complex device geometries and introduction of new materials in the manufacturing of today\u2019s semiconductor devices generate inherent device weak points which in turn give rise to mechanisms that result in yield impacting defects. The development and introduction of finFET has helped considerably in the quest to further shrink design rule. However, the design and complex manufacturing process involved in producing these high performance finFET devices bring with it a whole new class of defects that have considerable impact on device performance and yield. Some of these defects are buried beneath the wafer surface and are very difficult to detect. They are often missed by optical inspection, only to cause fails at final testing. Failure analysis (FA) then becomes the only means by which they are uncovered. FA is a destructive methodology and its benefits are realized only after the fact. Unlike FA, e-Beam inspection is non-destructive. e-Beam uses electron optics and has a unique ability to detect buried defects electrically by voltage contrast (VC) between a defective structure and its reference. As process window gets tighter and tighter process margin becomes difficult to predict. In this work, e-Beam inspection and overlay data is used to identify process weakness regions on wafer to predict fails and help optimize process and improve yield.", "Advanced nodes require tighter and tighter overlay control to secure products yield. Market like automotive one are even more demanding on \u201coverlay reliability\u201d till the extreme edge of wafers. High order models including Correction per Exposure capabilities are now introduced on the most critical immersion layers to put extra correction on the edge of wafers scanner fields. To ensure a correction model able to bring back these fields under overlay specification, the understanding of key process/equipment parameters to be put under control is needed. In this paper, choices done in term of overlay and Run to Run model will be discussed. On tools aspects, scanner table clean frequency impact and etch chambers variability will be addressed. In addition, etch recipe can modulate this etch chamber effect. The paper will conclude on the compromise to face in order to better correct and control overlay at the Edge of Wafer with the current Litho/Etch tools capabilities and R2R model strategy, at an acceptable cost (tool efficiency) and effort (rework, R2R complexity, \u2026)", "On-product overlay (OPO) challenges are quickly becoming yield limiters for the latest IC technology nodes, requiring new and innovative solutions to meet the technology demands. One of the primary means for reducing OPO error is the measurement of the grid (on target) at after-develop inspection (ADI) correctly and accurately. To reduce the optical error in the measurement, signals from both high voltage scanning electron microscope (HV-SEM) technology and imaging based overlay (IBO) measurements at ADI can be leveraged. Using key performance indicators (KPIs) and information produced by multiple optical measurement conditions, it is possible to optimize SEM sampling across the wafer and to capture all relevant target deformations. The objective is to improve the accuracy of optical measurements by efficiently combining information from HV-SEM and optical metrology systems. This paper will demonstrate that the information extracted from electron-based metrology and IBO measurements can be used for direct measurement of target deformations, which feeds into advanced optical target diagnostics and utilized for de-correlation between asymmetries and overlay (OVL).", "A standalone alignment technology was developed as a fundamental solution to improve on-product overlay (OPO). It enables high performance alignment measurements, and delivers state-of-the-art feed forward corrections to exposure scanner. Dense alignment sampling and high-order field distortion correction is effective for scanner fingerprint matching and for heat related field distortions. A modeling and sampling optimization software is a powerful tool for dense sampling and high-order overlay correction with minimal throughput loss. We performed an overlay experiment using the standalone alignment technology coupled with a modeling and sampling optimization software, which demonstrates on-product overlay improvement potential for next generation manufacturing accuracy and productivity challenges.", "In recent technology node manufacturing processes, on-product overlay (OPO) is becoming increasingly more important. In previous generations, the optimization of the total measurement uncertainty (TMU) itself was sufficient. However, with the use of modern technologies, target asymmetry-related measurement inaccuracy became a significant source of error, requiring new methods of control. This paper presents a machine learning (ML) based algorithm that reduces inaccuracy in misregistration measurements of the after-develop inspection (ADI) optical overlay (OVL). The algorithm relies on numerous features that were extracted from the OVL tool camera images, accuracy metrics derived from OVL computation, and other metadata. It is trained to estimate OVL measurement inaccuracy and produce corrected OVL per site. The ground truth of the ML model can include either internal or external OVL values. In the former case, the model is trained using wafer modeling errors (a.k.a. residuals), implying that these are a good indicator of target inaccuracy, which is a commonly used assumption. In the latter case, the model is trained using external overlay as the reference. If an accurate external reference overlay measurement exists, this option can be the most accurate. In both cases, the algorithm produces corrected OVL values. This study shows that for both ground truth options, the suggested method reduces inaccuracy and wafer modeling residuals in ADI optical OVL metrology measurements. The results were obtained by experimenting on production wafers from DRAM critical layers at SK Hynix. All the measurements were taken using an imaging-based overlay (IBO) technique and were validated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements of the same wafers.", "This paper reports line width roughness (LWR) measurement with edge averaging method (EAM) for different measurement length (L). The issues of LWR measurement are that raw LWR measurement data contains non-negligible image noise components and depends on L. EAM is an analysis method that creates several artificial images from 4D information (x axis, y axis, pixel color and frames) of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and detects pattern\u2019s edges. EAM is needed only 4 one-frame\u2019s images. Power spectral density (PSD), auto-correlation function (ACF) and height-height correlation function (HHCF) using EAM edge data were studied. As the second topic, the relationship among CD variation, LWR and PSD curves are described. The balance of CD variation and LWR depends on L. For example, when L is shortened, LWR at low frequency component changes to CD variation. To clarify L is important to compare various LWR measurement results. Therefore, we propose \u201c\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc45xr \u201d (x is \u201cBiased\u201d, \u201cUnbiased\u201d or \u201cNoise\u201d) to express LWR.", "The market transition from 2D to 3D-NAND in recent years requires strict focus control and monitoring solutions. ASML\u2019s \u03bcDBF targets (micro Diffraction Based Focus) enable on-product focus measurement which can be used to optimize scanner correction. Additionally, dense computational focus maps can be generated by combining \u03bcDBF measurements with scanner metrology such as non-correctable leveling error. This paper discusses the focus variability observed on memory layers through on product focus monitoring. This work will show how exposure at best focus can be performed for immersion lithography in the case of strong focus fingerprints. Focus monitoring data from \u03bcDBF and computational focus metrology will be used to generate and apply corrections on two 3D-NAND layers.", "In this work a novel machine learning algorithm is used to calculate the after etch overlay of the memory holes in a 3DNAND device based on OCD metrology by YieldStar S1375. It is shown that the method can distinguish the overlay signals from the process induced signals in the acquired pupil image and therefore, enables for an overlay metrology approach which is highly robust to process variations. This metrology data is used to characterize and correct the process induced intra-die stress and the DUV scanner application fingerprint.", "Self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) has quickly become the most viable multi-patterning scheme adopted for manufacturing critical layers in logic and memory devices below the 10nm (N10) technology node. Occurrence of pitch walk is a very common phenomenon in post SAQP layers. If not properly managed, the absolute value and variability of pitch walk could result in either parametric yield degradation or catastrophic fin-loss defects. These issues result from the interaction with subsequent processes, such as keeps and cuts, which are used to define and isolate fin groups for building the transistors. Previous studies have shown that a combined lithography and etch methodology would help reduce the pitch walk impact [1]. In this article, we will show advanced control for SAQP pitch walk using a combined scheme of lithography, deposition and etch actuators, in a front end 5nm logic process. By the implementation of a rigorous pitch walk prediction model that is calibrated and validated with wafer data, we then expand the model coverage to include an edge placement error component. This accounts for the contribution of overlay from subsequent layers to predict patterning defect probability at the final stage of device structure formation. With this approach, we can identify the optimal process control loop that minimizes pitch walk effects while maximizes the process margin for subsequent layers for this integration scheme.", "The method to perform Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) model calibration with contour-based input data from both small field of view (SFoV) and large field of view (LFoV) e-beam inspection is presented. For advanced OPC models - such as Neural Network Assisted Models (NNAM) [1], pattern sampling is a critical topic, where pattern feature vectors utilized in model training, such as image parameter space (IPS) is critical to ensure accurate model prediction [2-5]. In order to improve the design space coverage, thousands of gauges with unique feature vector combinations might be brought into OPC model calibration to improve pattern coverage. The time and cost in conventional Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope (CD-SEM) metrology to measure this large amount of CD gauges is costly. Hence, an OPC modeling solution with contourbased input has been introduced [6]. Built on this methodology, a single inspection image and SEM contour can include a large amount of information along polygon edges in complex logic circuit layouts. Namely, a better feature vector coverage could be expected [7]. Furthermore, much less metrology time is needed to collect the OPC modeling data comparing to conventional CD measurements. It is also shown that by utilizing large field 2D contours, which are difficult to characterize by CD measurements, in model calibration the model prediction of 2D features is improved. Finally, the model error rms of conventional SFoV modeling and LFoV contour modeling between SEM contours and simulation results are compared.", "Electron beam (EB) metrology of Ge channel gate-all-around (GAA) FET (field effect transistor) was investigated. Ge-GAA FET is one of the promising candidates for high performance pMOS device of future node. Ge is superior to Si in hole mobility which can be enhanced further by applying compressive channel strain in GAA structure with SiGe strain relaxed buffer (SRB). Coincide with this advantage, channel buckling could happen more easily. Thus, a monitoring method of channel buckling is required. Chemical instability of Ge is another issue in fabrication process. It is suspected that EB irradiation during SEM inspection could cause the deterioration of device performance. On this background, following two evaluations were performed. The first one is quantitative evaluation of channel buckling. It is found that the channel buckling can be quantified with a proposed buckling index. The second one is assessment of the EB-induced damage on the electrical properties. The results showed that EB irradiation on Ge channels does not affect the device performance when the device is annealed adequately. In conclusion, EB metrology is effective for the evaluation of channel buckling and applicable to Ge channels without deterioration of the device performance.", "In the semiconductor manufacturing industry, Automatic Defect Classification (ADC) plays an important role in maintaining high wafer inspection quality and reducing yield loss. ADC performance has benefitted from using machine learning (ML) algorithms; however, performance is negatively affected by the data imbalance and limited amounts of training data. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is an oversampling technique to adjust the skewed class distribution of a dataset so that the bias of the majority class is reduced. This paper shows that applying SMOTE achieved higher accuracy and purity on two imbalanced datasets, consisting of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images collected with ASML-HMI eP\u2122 and eScan\u00ae series inspection tools. The ML models are also less sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters when SMOTE is applied. We also show that better classification results can be obtained with less training samples with SMOTE; we conducted an experiment where a ML model trained on only 25% of samples with SMOTE achieved a higher ADC accuracy and purity performance compared to the same ML model trained on all samples but without SMOTE. In another experiment using a highly imbalanced SEM dataset with very few counts of the defect-of- interest (DOI), the combination of SMOTE and random undersampling of the majority class improves the accuracy by up to 5x while maintaining the same level of purity.", "Continuous reduction in pattern size, the primary path of advancement for the semiconductor industry, has greatly increased resolution and throughput demands for defect inspection and metrology, where Electronic-beam (E-beam) wafer inspection equipment has been commonly used for both purposes. High resolution is specifically needed in order to inspect or measure these smaller patterns and is accomplished by either decreasing pixel size or increasing frame averages. Both of these adjustments come with a big penalty of throughput, which is an extremely important metric as large areas of the wafer must be inspected in a reasonable time to meet semiconductor development, yield ramp and high volume manufacturing process control requirements. A slow inspection means more inspection tools are required and lots are delayed by the longer process time. In order to regain throughput, it is common to try to back off on the frame averages, but this often results in low quality images with noise, blurring effects, and distortions. The end result is less defect sensitivity for inspections, lower CD measurement accuracy and precision for metrology. Image quality enhancement (IQE) algorithms can compensate for this and thereby play a significant role in achieving higher throughput while keeping sufficient sensitivity. In recent years, deep learning methods have demonstrated superior performance to traditional algorithms for IQE. However, these methods often require clean ground truth data for supervised training purposes, which is extremely difficult and expensive to achieve. For example, ground truth images with lower noise levels can be obtained by averaging hundreds of frames at the same location, but, in addition to taking a very long time, can cause permanent physical damage to the wafer due to the E-beam wafer imaging process, and unexpected artifacts or shadowing effects. In order to alleviate these issues, we propose an unsupervised machine learning- based image quality enhancement framework (uMLIQE) using deep learning methods, which does not require clean target images for the training process. In fact, only one or a few images are required since the required information can be extracted by segmenting the available image. The performance of this system was compared both via simulation and experimentally to a comprehensive list of alternate IQE approaches. The wafer we used for data collection was generated with standard semiconductor processing representative of CMOS processing across the industry. The unsupervised approach is clearly superior to all alternatives both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our proposed unsupervised deep learning IQE framework for SEM images has proven superior for throughput enhancement for high resolution E-beam wafer imaging.", "With continuous scaling and increased design and process complexity, there is an increasing need for semiconductor manufacturing process control. This need calls for not only advanced methods and more capable tools, but also additional intra-wafer and across-lot sampling in order to capture process variations and/or changes in process signatures. In this paper we will demonstrate high speed full wafer metrology use cases from the KLA CIRCL\u2122 platform. The CIRCL platform is typically used for very high throughput inline macro defect inspection. Here we demonstrate that this tool can also be used for certain types of metrology applications. In this paper, we will investigate metrology opportunities with full wafer coverage for critical process parameters on two test vehicles: (1) a 32nm pitch regular line-and-space defect vehicle patterned with single exposure EUV and (2) an iN7 BEOL integration test vehicle, also patterned with single exposure EUV.", "Utilizing a unique high NA optical system, a new methodology to measure device overlay accurately has been developed with a key differentiation. Historically, optical techniques to measure features below the image resolution require supporting measurement techniques to be used as a reference to anchor the optical measurement. This novel selfreference methodology enables accurate and robust optical metrology for device features after etch eliminating the need for external reference measurements such as Decap, x-sections or high landing energy SEMs. In this paper, we discuss how a high NA Optical Metrology system enables measurements on small area device replica targets, which enables the ability to create a reference target for device measurements. The methodology utilizes this reference target to enable accurate direct on device overlay measurements without the need for an external reference. Furthermore, the technique is expanded to improve the robustness of the measurement and monitor live in production the health of the recipe, ensuring accuracy overtime. This ultimately leads to a method to extend the recipes in real-time based on the health KPIs. The improved accurate and robust device overlay measurements have proven to improve the overlay performance compared to other techniques. This, combined with the speed of optical systems, enables unconstrained dense measurements directly on device structures after etch, allowing for improved overlay control.", "The accurate and precise contour extraction on SEM image is important to measure overlay, improve OPC model, inspect tiny hot-spot, and so on. In 2019, we reported about the measurement repeatability of edge placement error (EPE) with Die-to-Database (D2DB) algorithm. In this study, we apply machine learning for the contour extraction to improve the measurement throughput with high accuracy and precision of EPE on 2D pattern. The pattern contour on SEM image can be extracted by processing gray-level profile data across the measurement line. Generally, in order to extract the precise contour, the direction of the profile should be perpendicular to the pattern contour. Although the direction used to be determined by the design pattern, it can\u2019t be accurate enough to extract the contour exactly since the shape between the design pattern and the actual pattern are different. We propose the method that determines the direction of the profile acquisition using the contour taken by machine learning, which is more similar to the actual pattern contour than the design pattern contour. The accuracy and the precision of EPE measurement using the contour extracted by our method has been improved in actual SEM images captured repeatedly.", "Overlay control for recording head manufacturing is becoming increasingly challenging as design geometry specifications tighten in the transition to advanced Heated Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) devices. As overlay control requirements for critical patterning layers tighten below 5nm, the need for accurate and robust overlay metrology is key to enabling the patterning roadmap and improving yields. This work focuses on improving Imaged Based Overlay (IBO) metrology to ensure accurate overlay measurements for critical lithography steps in the recording head fabrication process. Selection of the optimal settings for color filter and Numeric Aperture (NA) parameters can have a significant impact on overlay measurement accuracy and Total Measurement Uncertainty (TMU) when setting up a new overlay metrology recipe1-2. These overlay metrology recipe parameters can be selected to minimize the influence of process induced overlay target imperfections on the measured overlay 3. This paper reports our revised workflow for selecting IBO measurement conditions and evaluating pre-existing recipes for robustness. We utilize metrics such as the overlay model residuals, Tool Induced Shift (TIS), and Qmerit error in identifying recipes requiring improvement. The new \u201cTrain Log\u201d feature available on KLA\u2019s Archer\u2122 IBO metrology tool platform can be used to compare the through focus contrast precision of different illumination conditions at the time of recipe creation. In this study, we show that an optimization workflow that utilizes the \u201cTrain Log\u201d collection of the contrast precision metric and imageless recipes in selecting color filter and numeric aperture settings can significantly improve the overlay measurement repeatability and tool to tool matching.", "Tool induced shift (TIS) is a measurement error attributed to tool asymmetry issues and is commonly used to measure the accuracy of metrology tools. Overlay (OVL) measurement inaccuracy is commonly caused by lens aberration, lens alignment, illumination alignment and asymmetries on the measured target. TIS impacts total measurement uncertainty (TMU) and tool-to-tool matching, and TIS variation across wafer can account for inaccuracy, if not fully corrected, as it depends on the incoming process condition. In addition, both lot-to-lot and wafer-to-wafer process variation are influenced by TIS in terms of overlay performance, which also includes metrology tool-to-tool efficiency in terms of throughput. In the past, TIS correction was only done using a small sampling, resulting in additional error in the measurement which was not corrected. Hence, a new methodology is explored to improve overlay measurement accuracy by Modeled-TIS (M-TIS). This paper discusses a new approach of harnessing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict TIS correction on imaging-based overlay (IBO) measurements at the after-develop inspection (ADI) step. KLA\u2019s ML algorithm is trained to detect TIS error contributors to overlay measurements by training a model to find the required TIS correction for one wafer. This information, along with additional accuracy metrics, is then used to predict the TIS for other wafers, without having to actually measure the wafers. In this paper, we present the results of a case study focusing on DRAM and 3D NAND production lots.", "As the semiconductor industry rapidly approaches the 3nm lithography node, on product overlay (OPO) requirements have become tighter and as a result, residuals magnitude requirements have become even more challenging. Metrology performance enhancements are required to meet these demands. Color Per Layer (CPL) is a unique imaging overlay metrology approach that enables the measurement of each layer with individually-optimized wavelength and focus position. CPL allows the user to custom-define the most suitable conditions per layer, thereby ensuring optimal performance. Imaging-based overlay (IBO) utilizes CPL in order to overcome inaccuracies due to interactions between bottom and top layers. These layers are fundamentally different in that the top grating is usually the photoresist layer, but the bottom grating can be any process layer. Therefore, optimizing the conditions for each layer will maximize measurement accuracy. KLA\u2019s Archer\u2122 700 metrology tool addresses these metrology challenges by putting CPL to use, where the Wave Tuner (WT) allows the user to select a specific wavelength. This paper presents this novel CPL approach and discusses its reduction in OPO and contrast, and reviews use cases from DRAM and 3D NAND. We will present the results from these case studies, focusing on SK Hynix DRAM production wafers.", "In the drive toward sub-10-nm semiconductor devices, manufacturers have been developing advanced lithography technologies such as extreme ultraviolet lithography and multiple patterning. However, these technologies can cause unexpected defects, and a high-speed inspection is thus required to cover the entire surface of a wafer. A Die-to-Database (D2DB) inspection is commonly known as a high-speed inspection. The D2DB inspection compares an inspection image with a design layout, so it does not require a reference image for comparing with the inspection image, unlike a die-to-die inspection, thereby achieving a high-speed inspection. However, conventional D2DB inspections suffer from erroneous detection because the manufacturing processes deform the circuit pattern from the design layout, and such deformations will be detected as defects. To resolve this issue, we propose a deep-learning-based D2DB inspection that can distinguish a defect deformation from a normal deformation by learning the luminosity distribution in normal images. Our inspection detects outliers of the learned luminosity distribution as defects. Because our inspection requires only normal images, we can train the model without defect images, which are difficult to obtain with enough variety. In this way, our inspection can detect unseen defects. Through experiments, we show that our inspection can detect only the defect region on an inspection image.", "Critical dimension analysis of cross-section image with delicate accuracy has become important demand for semiconductor manufacturing. In traditional analytic method, manual measurements always accompany large deviation and lower measured efficiency. Therefore, a robust and reliable analysis method is most essential objective to obtain accurate dimensions from PFA results. In this work, we demonstrate an intelligent image analysis method which is combined Mask Region based Convolution Neural Networks (Mask r-CNN) and image processing technique. Compared with manual measurement, intelligent image analysis method can achieve significant improvement on measured results in reproducibility, repeatability, and efficiency. This intelligent image analysis will provide novel applications in CD measurement, wafer defect analysis, and focus-exposure process window judgment.", "The Rapid Probe Microscope (RPM), exists as an integrated solution for photomask repair, with its application extended to include wafer metrology in 2016 [1]. The RPM can acquire non-destructive, high resolution, sub-nm detail in all 3 dimensions, overcoming some of the limitations of conventional AFM. In addition, it is flexible and can be configured to run either in air or in vacuum. The RPM includes the innovative use of an interferometric detection system to simultaneously measure both the height and the deflection of the cantilever, while the probe is controlled through photo thermal actuation. This combination delivers an accurate, very fast, direct measurement of the height of the probe and the corresponding structure of the sample surface. The X,Y probe scanner movement is also monitored by an interferometer. This guarantees both the linearity and XY position of the probe tip, delivering a corresponding sub-nm metrology of the wafer structure.", "In the latest 3D NAND devices there is a larger focus on measurement accuracy control, coupled with more traditional minimization of Total Measurement Uncertainty (TMU). Measurement inaccuracy consumes an increasingly significant part of the overlay (OVL) budget, requiring control and optimization.\nIn this paper we will show the improvement in imaging OVL measurement accuracy using wave tuning (WT) capability combined with advanced algorithms to address 3D NAND process challenges. In addition to new OVL target designs that take advantage of WT capability, we also demonstrate improvement in OVL model residuals through optimization of measurement bandwidth, focus position and number of grab frames. Improvements in precision and tool-to-tool matching are also realized through both optimization of the region of interest (ROI) and splitting measurement areas using a dual-recipe technique.", "In microelectronic device manufacturing, photosensitive organic insulators (POIs) are widely used during passivation steps to protect and preserve the chips from damage due to subsequent processes and from the external environment. To ensure high performance and to maintain chip quality, a well-controlled POI lithography process and corresponding defectivity monitoring are needed. In this work, we present an automated method developed by STMicroelectronics and KLA for POI defectivity and process control employing a KLA 8 Series inspection system with illumination in the visible range. The highly sensitive macro inspection tool with dedicated analysis approaches and solutions successfully enabled the detection of the principal defects of interest, the identification of defectivity root causes through automatic classification and review, and the evaluation of the layer thickness and uniformity through reflected intensity heatmaps. For several months, this protocol has been applied to the production environment, proving to be effective in detecting even small deviations from the standard process. Here, we present some promising results obtained with this strategy, highlighting the benefits in terms of rework reduction and improved equipment management.", "Metrology requirements at advanced nodes are not only tightening on specifications but also broadening in terms of flexibility needed to cover variety of product stacks. Metrology targets need to be process compatible and at the same time these targets should also be readable by the metrology system. In some cases, process conditions require a target pitch that is large compared to the wavelength used by the metrology system. Examples of these situations include for instance topography transfer or stacks with thick resist (for e.g. 3D-NAND). Traditionally overlay is extracted from the asymmetry in the positive and negative first diffraction order generated from \u03bcDBO targets. However, when the pitch is large, the targets generate multiple higher diffraction orders. Current state-of-the-art diffraction based overlay systems do not take into account the effect of these higher diffraction orders and typically only select the first diffraction order. This is done by reducing the pitch of the target, tuning the wavelength or by changing the angle of incidence of the illumination light. To address wavelength over pitch flexibility an advanced algorithm was introduced on a new metrology system in the fab, providing full flexibility in the selection of measurement wavelength and pitch. To obey the specifications on accuracy and throughput, we will present a new metrology system that is, compared to its predecessor, about 2x faster and able to measure more accurately because of the ability to measure multiple wavelengths within the same time frame.", "The paper represents a comparison of simulated light scattering of the near and far fields of subwavelength grating at various wavelengths. By quantifying and comparing the scattered near and far fields of multiple grating parameters to the nominal parameter based scattered field, the sensitivity to the change of grating parameters is determined. The wavelength influence on the near field is analyzed by applying a plane wave at certain angle of incidence and the far field diffraction patterns are simulated by applying coherent focused light (conical incidence). The paper analyses how each wavelength affects the sensitivity to the change of the height and the sidewall angle of a subwavelength grating.", "One of the challenges of surface characterization at the nano-scale is that analytical tools which are capable of topological nano-scale analysis have limited capabilities for molecular characterization. Here we present a study on molecular characterization of positive tone photo-resist films with varying exposure dose. The technique is based on secondary ion mass spectrometry, SIMS, with gold nanoparticles (e.g. Au4+400). In the methodology a sequence of individual gold nanoparticles is used to stochastically bombard the photoresist films, where each impact results in the emission of ions from a region 10-20 nm in diameter. The technique has several unique features which enable molecular characterization at the nano-scale. Firstly, the use of individual massive clusters impacts which sample nano-volumes, and from these nano-volumes multiple molecular ions can be ejected simultaneously. Secondly, the acquisition of the mass spectra from each projectile impact allows co-ejected ions to be collected in the same mass spectrum. These two features allow for tests on the nano-scale homogeneity of molecules. This is of particular interest for photoresist films, where nano-scale inhomogeneity may result in poor quality films. In this study we examined bulk photoresist films with varying dose post development, in order to probe physical aggregation and chemical transformation on the partially exposed resist pattern side wall and surface. We found that the cation and anion of the photoacid generator were not removed equally during development, and we found that the quencher is not completely removed by the developer.", "For today\u2019s advanced processes, in order to achieve higher optical lithography resolution, some of the layers require extreme dipole illumination conditions. One example is the modern DRAM process, where numerous critical layers are patterned with extreme dipole scanner illumination. Conventional (both imaging-based and diffraction-based) overlay marks on such layers typically use horizontal or vertical lines that suffer from insufficient accuracy in overlay device tracking. The new Diagonal AIM (DAIM\u2122) overlay mark mimics the actual device through the usage of tilted structures. Significant improvement in device overlay tracking was demonstrated using the DAIM overlay mark.", "On product overlay (OPO) shrink is a key enabler to achieve high yield in integrated circuit manufacturing. One of the key factors to enable accurate measurement on grid (target) is the use of optimized overlay (OVL) mark design to achieve low OPO. The OVL mark design enables accurate and robust OVL metrology and improves measurability and basic performance requirements such as total measurement uncertainty (TMU). In this paper, we demonstrate the methodology of mark design for different devices based on simulations, measurements and verification. We compare OVL performance of AIM\u00ae targets and grating-over-grating imaging targets utilizing the Moir\u00e9 effect. Methodologies described in this work utilize robust AIM (rAIM\u2122) targets, target design from the MTD AcuRate\u2122 simulation-based OVL metrology target design tool, and the Archer\u2122 OVL metrology system.", "In order to achieve better resolution and improve lithography process window, device manufacturers are looking into or adopting high transmission attenuated phase shift mask (HTM). The critical dimension uniformity (CDU) of the device pattern can be quite a bit better with high transmission mask as compared to conventional attenuated phase shift mask, which makes it an attractive choice for advanced memory devices. However, it poses challenges on metrology targets such as alignment marks or micro diffraction-based overlay (uDBO) marks, which has different dimensions as device patterns as required by the metrology sensors. The challenges include printability, detectability, accuracy, process compatibility and defectively on the same device layer. In this paper we demonstrate solutions to address these challenges and thereby improve metrology for advanced memory devices with HTM. Without sacrificing mark contrast on wafer, the wafer quality of alignment mark is improved up to 10 times with respect to array like alignment marks and the stack sensitivity of uDBO mark can also increase more than 7 times as array like marks. Through a holistic target approach involving target design, target OPC, and recipe setup, we are able to achieve accurate metrology for optimal on-product overlay and device yield.", "During wafer exposure, the scanner overlays product structures from the layer being exposed onto underlying layers, with a limited error margin. Alignment is the process of measuring pre-defined marks that have been exposed on previous layers and using these measurements to determine what adjustments to make during exposure. Current alignment marks are still quite big compared to overlay targets and fill quite some reticle-area. Therefore, there is a drive towards narrower and smaller alignment marks in order to free up scribe-lane space. Further, during design of narrower and/or smaller alignment marks, not only the width or length needs to be taken into account, but also the process loading effect and scribe-lane dummy following rules.\nMaximizing product-area is an important driver for many DRAM customers. One way is by reducing scribe-lane space. Currently most customers are using 60um to 90 um wide scribe-lanes. However, developments are ongoing to further reduce this to 40um -50um. The current narrowest standard ASML alignment marks are 40 um wide and there is a growing demand for narrower and even smaller marks. Experiment tool groups configure selection with ASML SMASH senor and it brings more possibility in scribe-lane design and alignment size topic.\nTests with narrow alignment marks were done on an ASML XT1460K scanner with SMASH3.1 sensor. Both narrow DPCM (coarse align) and narrow NSSM marks (coarse and fine align) were tested and the impact on accuracy, repro and overlay was investigated. The width of the DPCM marks was reduced from 160um to 150um and 140um. The width of the NSSM (AA11 and AH53) marks was reduced from 40um to 30um and 28um.\nThis paper will explain the tests done in detail and will present the results of using narrow marks on alignment mark repro, mark KPIs (WQ, MCC, etc.) and overlay performance. These results will be compared to those of the standard marks. Also results from further alignment mark recipe optimization will be presented.", "In this paper we introduce a new metrology technique for measuring wafer geometry on silicon wafers. Wave Front Phase Imaging (WFPI) has high lateral resolution and is sensitive enough to measure roughness on a silicon wafer by simply acquiring a single image snapshot of the entire wafer. WFPI is achieved by measuring the reflected light intensity from monochromatic uncoherent light at two different planes along the optical path with the same field of view. We show that the lateral resolution in the current system is 24\u03bcm though it can be pushed to less than 5\u03bcm by simply adding more pixels to the image sensor. Also, we show that the amplitude resolution limit is 0.3nm. A 2-inch wafer was measured while laying on a flat sample holder and the roughness was revealed by applying a double Gaussian high pass filter to the global topography data. The same 2-inch wafer was also placed on a simulated robotic handler arm, and we show that even if gravity was causing extra bow on the wafer, the same roughness was still being revealed at the same resolution after a high pass filter was applied to the global wafer geometry data.", "In advanced DRAM semiconductor manufacturing, there is a need to reduce the overlay fingerprints. Reducing on device fingerprints with very high spatial frequency remains one of the bottlenecks to achieve sub-2nm on device overlay. After-etch device overlay measurements using the YieldStar in-device metrology (IDM)[1] allow for previously unassessed and uncontrolled fingerprints to be corrected employing higher-order overlay corrections. This is because this technology allows dramatically increased overlay metrology sampling at affordable throughputs. This paper reports considerations for enabling dense after-etch overlay based corrections in a high volume manufacturing environment. Results will be shown on a front end critical layer of SK hynix that has been sampled with IDM with high density wafer sampling, over dozens of lots spanning several weeks.", "In the 14nm FinFET(Fin-shaped Field-Effect Transistor) node, SADP(Self-Aligned Double Patterning) technology has been introduced to produce Fin because of the exposure limit of 193nm DUV immersion lithography. As is known to all, pitch walking issue appears when the technology comes to SADP, so how to accurately measure pitch walking is particularly important. In this paper, we use CD-SEM(Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope) to measure the CD(Critical Dimension) of Fin pitch inline, and evaluate different parameter settings or machine type to improve the accuracy of the measurement results. For sub-nanometer accuracy of line width measurement, TEM(Transmission Electron Microscope) image is used to calibrate the line width measurements as a kind of reference metrology.", "Accurate segmentation of 3D-NAND memory cells and the interfaces of different materials within is the basis of reliable metrology for 3D-NAND memory fabrication. We are proposing a machine learning assisted fast marching level sets method (FMLS) to efficiently delineate material interfaces within 3D-NAND cells. This method works with single or multiple seed initialization that evolves and propagates towards object boundaries independent of topological merger and splitting. Images containing thousands of NAND cells can be processed within a few seconds using this method, making this a very convenient tool for inline metrology during fabrication. With an appropriate preprocessing, FMLS can be used to segment nonconvex structures, such as fins and gates, too.", "Optical encoding technology is one of the most popular technologies with nano-meter degree accuracy in precise displacement metrology field. Basically, two optical gratings overlap in the encoder, resulting in Moir\u00e9 fringes. An optical sensor records the Moir\u00e9 fringes signal. When one of the optical gratings moves, the Moir\u00e9 fringes will vary. The phase of the Moir\u00e9 fringes is extracted from the signal, and the displacement is obtained from the phase. The fabrication always becomes more difficult and the cost is higher when the measurement accuracy becomes higher for such optical encoder. We have developed a simple, novel encoder with only one optical grating and an optical imaging system. The Moir\u00e9 fringe curve is obtained when the optical grating overlaps with two complementary digital gratings which are virtually constructed with a CCD or CMOS sensor in a camera. In this technique, the Moir\u00e9 fringe curve is not a strict sine wave, leading to some difficulty to accurately extract the phase value. This paper compares the performance of four phase extraction algorithms, i.e., Fourier transform, polynomial fitting, Hilbert transform and wavelet transform. The experimental results show that both the measurement accuracy and repeatability of the four algorithms are within 30 nm after calibration. The overall accuracy of the wavelet transform is the best with minimum error of only 5 nm. The processing speed of FFT is the fastest, reaching sub millisecond level.", "The inherent local inhomogeneity in a uniformly average distribution of dissolution aiding events is shown through an algebraic model to be the likely source of missing contacts in projection printing in positive photoresist resist. A granular model of dissolution with voxels 1-3% of a contact core volume having Poisson statistics is used to show that a configuration of 5-10 voxels with stochastically low dissolution aiding events can block a resist etch front or polymer disentanglement at nominal exposure conditions. To drive missing contact error rates to 10-13 for 25 nm contacts requires increasing the normal event density by 59% which is 8-9% per decade error rate reduction. In scaling, the event density increases as the inverse of the cube of contact size. For 12 nm contacts an alternating phaseshifting mask may be enabling.", "In this work, we connected the analytical determination of the EUV Dill C parameter for different photodecomposable base quencher (PDB) architectures using a standard addition method, the influence of the underlying hardmask on postdevelop EUV resist residue formation, and the vertical PAG and PDB concentration profile throughout the depth of the film determined by GCIB-TOF-SIMS for a model EUV resist system. The collected experimental data was used to feed a resist patterning simulation engine, in order to understand the additive effect of component distribution and efficiency on EUV stochastics and its potential impact on defect control. Our results unveiled a link between PDB quantum yield and nanoscopic material distribution uniformity. In parallel, a differentiating behavior was observed among inorganic underlayers: metal oxide hardmasks (HMs) invariably induced more resist residue than non-metallic HMs. Last, a specific example of joint PAG and PDB concentration depletion at the resist-substrate interface was related to a potential increase in microbridge defectivity as a result of poor stochastic counts.", "Flood Exposure Assisted Chemical Gradient Enhancement Technology (FACET) is introduced for improvement in EUV resist resolution, process control, roughness, patterning failure and sensitivity. Experimental EUV exposure latitude was enhanced (~1.5 times) with FACET using the assist of UV flood exposure. The mechanism of the process window improvement by FACET is explained by non-linear resist coloring (enhancement of UV absorption) vs. EUV exposure dose to enhance acid image contrast during UV flood exposure. To balance chemical gradient enhancement and stochastic effects, Stochastic Aware Resist Formulation and Process optimizer (SARF-Pro) with a fast stochastic simulation model is created. SARF-Pro predicts stochastic patterning failure risks, and optimizes resist formulation and processes by putting emphasis on stochastic variation across patterns. Photosensitized Chemically Amplified ResistTM (PSCARTM) 2.0 with FACET and standard chemically amplified resist (CAR) optimized in SARF-Pro suggests that PSCAR 2.0 with FACET has the potential of better process window, roughness, sensitivity and, we hypothesize, reduced risk of stochastic defects compared with standard CAR.", "In this presentation, we will show our efforts for the discovery of high-performance imaging reactions based on fluorine and radical chemistry working under high-energy radiation. Prior to this study, we have reported molecular resists equipped with rather flexible perfluorinated alkyl ether (PFAE) chains and their imaging behavior as negative-tone resists under electron beam irradiation. In this study, we turned our attention to another fluorinated unit, fluorinated aromatic compounds, possessing structural rigidity that we believe contributes to achieving improved patterning capabilities. Successful coupling reactions between a phenolic resist core and fluorinated arenes provided fluorinated molecular resists, which we evaluated in terms of imaging behavior under e-beam and EUV lithographic conditions. The solubility of their thin films was decreased by the high-energy radiation; thus, negative-tone patterns down to 30 nm half-pitch could be obtained after development in fluorous solvents.", "A new non-CAR hemicellulose resist is proposed for use in high-NA EUV lithography. This resist has high sensitivity (EUV dose 34.4 mJ/cm2) and high resolution (half-pitch of more than 16 nm) compared to conventional chain scission resists. Additionally, the process flow is very simple (no need for PEB) and the resist film is stable throughout the process. It was confirmed that the RIE selectivity ratio (Si/resist) of the non-CAR hemicellulose resist was 3.7, and am L/S pattern was obtained with a Si depth of 120.4 nm and a half-pitch of 18 nm. Furthermore, a new resist process, PreMi (pre-exposure metal insertion), was proposed. The PreMi process is expected to improve the fabrication properties, increase sensitivity and contrast, and reduce defects. Te and Sn were employed as metal types in this study, and EUV L/S patterns of PreMi-Te and PreMi-Sn were obtained. It was confirmed the PreMi process improved the fabrication properties of the no-PreMi process by a factor of 2. The non-CAR hemicellulose resist and PreMi process have great potential for use in high-NA EUV lithography.", "Introduction of EUV lithography using soft X-ray at wavelength of 13.5 nm has been started because of demand for miniaturization at low cost in mass production of semiconductor devices. Chemically amplified resist (CAR) has been utilized for many years and is also one of the promising materials for EUV resist. However, resist performances (resolution, line edge roughness, and sensitivity) show trade-off relationship and the searching for the solution has been still a serious problem. In the previous work, our group has shown that addition of Di-p-tolyl sulfone (DTS) into CAR increases acid generation efficiency (acid-generating promoter (AGP)). DTS acts as deprotonation promoter and recombination inhibitor between ionized polymer and electron. The resist performance upon exposure to electron beams (EB) was improved. In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of CAR to 13.5 nm EUV light upon adding new diphenyl sulfone derivatives. EB lithographic effects by adding some diphenyl sulfone derivatives were also studied. And the detail roles of AGP are also discussed.", "Although EUV process was actually inserted to HVM as realistic photographic scaling driver relieving from Multiple patterning, process/material induced defect, especially missing type defect on via hole, must be serious problem and it is really considerable subject. In our previous work, the existing of latent defect around hole bottom was examined and effective solution for defect suppression utilizing robust etching technique was introduced [1]. Additional de-scumming process before etching of under SoG layer has wider capability to suppress the missing hole defect, however, photolithographic relevant problem has to be solved in photolithography area. In this study, assuming that the origin of not-opened hole might be insolubilized potion in photo-resist film, we examined mainly interfacial reaction between photo-resist and under-layer. Historically, adhesive work(W) have been studied to prevent the peeling or collapsing of resist pattern mainly [2][3][4]. In order to understand the reason to be insoluble the solubilized region despite exposed, de-protected and polarity changed. This paper would introduce our examination results about the infliction of resist adhesive work with modified underlayer surface and mention about our explorations of insolubilized mechanism.", "The photo-mask in lithographic process of semiconductor device has an important role to transfer the downsized target image to the wafer. Due to the development of information society, demand for semiconductor devices has been growing. In order to increase photo-mask manufacturing throughput, the current density of electron beam (EB) has been getting higher. EB exposure increases the resist temperature on mask substrate inhomogeneous depending on its current density, shot size, writing order and etc. It is known that the resist sensitivity increases with irradiated resist temperature (heating effect). So, inhomogeneous temperature increase of resist on mask substrate disturbs precise pattern formation. However, the physical or chemical mechanism of heating effect has been still unknown. Here, we examined temperature dependence of acid generation process in chemically amplified resists (CARs). Poly(4- hydroxystyrene) (PHS) and poly(4-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)oxy]styrene-co-4-hydroxystyrene) (PTBSHS) were used as CAR resin. Monte Carlo simulation moving thermalized electron under the electric field between polymer radical cations were performed with changing the temperature. From the simulation, it was revealed that the energy increase of thermalized electron contributes to the acid yield by 0.038 %/K. Quantification of the acid yields in resist films upon exposed to EB were performed with changing the temperature by titration method using Coumarin 6 (C6) as an acid sensitive dye. The acid yield increased by 0.14 %/K in PHS film and 0.21 %/K in PTBSHS film, respectively. Both values were higher than the simulation value (0.038 %/K). Pulse radiolysis experiment was also performed to observe deprotonation of polymer radical cations at 298 and 343 K. The decay of dimer radical cation of PTBSHS became 1.6 times faster at 343 K than that at 298 K. From the results, it is suggested that the heating effect mainly caused by the temperature dependence of deprotonation rate from the radical cations of PTBSHS.", "Linewidth Roughness (LWR) remains a difficult challenge in resist materials. In previous work we focused on showing how roughness Power Spectral Density (PSD) parameters were affected by aerial image and basic resist parameters such as diffusion. This highlighted the relationship between PSD(0) and correlation length in optimizing LWR. By measuring the unbiased PSDs with MetroLER we showed LWR measurements could be expressed as a ratio between the roughness PSD parameters. In this paper we show how LWR improvement can be achieved by several strategies that focus on both PSD(0) and correlation length and not a single LWR number.", "Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have provided an opportunity for improvement in the field of lithography. Compared with the numerical simulation, machine learning/deep learning may provide much faster and more efficient performance, but they provide less accurate solution due to the limitation of the statistical approach. Typical machine learning models cannot take into account complex multiple processes such as UV exposure, photoreaction and photo-resist development in lithography. In this work, we developed a newly designed deep learning algorithm not only to improve the model accuracy but also to overcome data limitation. By combining a physics-driven machine learning model and a complex-valued neural network (CVNN), we designed a novel machine learning model structure. Applying CVNN to phase shift mask analysis could improve the model performance dramatically. As such, this work opens up a new class of photo-lithography analysis by using a novel neural network model.", "We demonstrate a simple ex-situ inorganic infiltration route for transforming standard organic resists into high-performance positive tone hybrid resist platform. A model thin film PMMA-AlOx hybrid resist system has been synthesized by hybridization of PMMA with AlOx and investigated for electron beam lithography. The approach possesses full controllability of the resist performance in terms of critical does, patterning contrast reaching up to 30 and etch resistance for plasma-based pattern transfer processes. The high selectivity Si etching capability demonstrated using a low-temperature cryo-Si etch process, based on the controlled infiltration outperforms commercial resists and typical hard mask material thermal SiO2, with estimated achievable selectivity in excess of ~300. Si nanostructures down to ~30 nm with aspect ratio up to ~17 are also transferred into the Si substrate. Easy implementation and adaptability for different inorganic infiltrations, this platform is well capable of potentially delivering the resist performance and throughput necessary for EUV lithography.", "The availability of EUV lithography is the mainstream for resolving critical dimension of the advanced technology nodes, currently in the range of 18nm and below [1]. The first insertion of EUVL into manufacturing utilizes chemically amplified resist (CAR) [2]. The filtration of CAR, both at bulk and point-of-use (POU), has already demonstrated in ArF and ArF immersion lithography to play a significant role for microbridges reduction essentially by removing hard particle and gels [3-6]. With respect to ArFi, EUV is bringing new challenges not only for the achievement of the required line roughness, sensitivity and resolution, but also for the need of a substantial reduction of defects such as line collapse, microbridges and broken lines. In this study, it demonstrated the ability of utilizing novel POU filtration to modulate microbridges and achieving superior start-up behavior, both crucial for enabling EUVL at high volume manufacturing. Different POU filters were tested at the imec EUV cluster comprised of TEL CleanTrack LITHIUS Pro-Z and ASML NXE:3400B. The start-up performance, assessed by measuring defects down to 19nm size as a function of the flushing solvent volume, has shown the fast achievement of attaining a stable baseline. Lithography experiments targeting reduction of on-wafer defectivity, carried out with commercially available photoresists, have consistently shown a substantial reduction of after resist development (ADI) and after resist etch (AEI) microbridges on a 16nm L/S test vehicles. The effect of membrane physical intrinsic designs and novel cleaning of POU devices are discussed.", "3D NAND has become the mainstream technology to support bit growth of NAND Flash. The main challenge of 3D NAND is the increased level of wafer deformation as more layers are stacked vertically. This global deformation of the substrate leads to a significant degradation of overlay performance. One potential way to address this challenge is through bow compensation by wafer backside deposition. However, it turns out that standard backside processes sometimes do not improve overlay. This study investigates this phenomenon and explores how to counter high levels of wafer deformation in a way that overlay performance does not deteriorate. Scanner monitor wafers with etched reference marks have been modified to create a variety of global warp levels, covering a wafer bow range from +300\u03bcm (bowl shape) to -550\u03bcm (umbrella shape). Subsequently, several different backside deposition processes have been applied to these wafers. Flat reference wafers, warped wafers, and compensated wafers have been then measured on NXT scanners with different wafer tables. Non-linear overlay residuals of these wafers from about 1nm (flat reference wafers) to more than 30nm (uncompensated highly deformed wafers) have been measured. The obtained data reveal clear correlations between overlay, global wafer shape and backside deposition. A demonstration of the optimized overlay performance on wafers with large warpage values will be shown with a detailed analysis through absolute overlay metrology.", "Further increasing integrated circuit storage capacities while reducing the cost has led to the development of stacked 3D structures for NAND application. The 3D NAND structures can be enabled by using KrF photoresist coated at high thickness, and a staircase pattern can be generated through multiple etch steps. Pushing KrF lithography to high coating thickness creates several challenges for the materials and formulation design, such as lack of film transparency, as well as film cracking and delamination. The photoresist used in KrF lithography is based on poly(hydroxystyrene) (PHS) type polymers, which is associated with unique technical challenges for printing 10s microns scale features due to its high absorbance at 248 nm and its high glass transition temperature, Tg. Here we report the development of novel KrF photoresist materials for 3D NAND application with sufficient film transmittance, which forms desired straight profile with no footing. Our results also indicate that the film cracking could be mitigated by additive and process condition optimization, and film delamination could be addressed by adding an adhesion promotion layer.", "CMOS optical sensors performances are mainly driven by the quantum efficiency and the pixel cross talk. Microlens arrays implementation is a way to improve both by focalizing the incident light on the active photodiode area. Further optimizations include fill factor maximization by reducing the space between microlenses.\nIn this study we propose the fabrication of zero gap microlens arrays by plasma etch transfer of reflowed microlenses into a subjacent resist layer. The impact of lithography, reflow and etch process parameters on microlenses shape and space reduction are discussed. We show that etch time increase allows gap reduction down to zero, while polymerization control is key to conserve microlens height.\nThe impact of 3 process factors on the final microlens shape are studied using DOE (design of experiment) methodology. Thus, microlenses gap and height evolution as a function of mask thickness, polymerizing gas flow and etch time are modeled within the experimental range of these factors. An optimum process point is then proposed to minimize the gap while keeping constant the microlens height.", "In this work, a novel chemical-free technique is proposed to remove adsorbed particles of less than 100 nm from a substrate. More specifically, the small particles buried under the \"stagnant layer\" were removed using a process that relied on the force generated by volumetric expansion on rapid freezing of supercooled water. In the process, water penetrated into the small (narrow) spaces via the capillary force; it then flowed into the narrow interfacial gap between the substrate and particles, and lifted the particles off the substrate via the volumetric expansion force on ice formation. Because fine patterns have no such gaps, they are not damaged during this process. In other words, unlike conventional cleaning technologies, such as mega sonic cleaning and two-fluid jet cleaning, this cleaning process is able to specifically target the small particles while the fine patterns are unaffected.", "Deposition-based patterning is becoming an important need in advanced manufacturing. Several new approaches are emerging where chemical etching is being coupled with atomic layer deposition to achieve area-selective deposition of dielectrics and metals. During ALD, selectivity is generally lost when undesired nuclei form on the targeted non-growth surface. These undesired nuclei can sometimes be removed by periodic etching, improving the overall selectivity. However, it is not known to what extent these coupled deposition/etching sequences can proceed while maintaining good selectivity. As desirable deposition and etching reactions proceed, other changes in the process can occur to enhance unwanted nucleation and/or impede desired etching, thereby limiting the net selectivity. Recent experiments in our lab have used in-situ probes to explore coupled thermal ALD and ALE super-cycles, performed sequentially under isothermal conditions in a single reaction chamber, to achieve area selective deposition of TiO2 on SiO2 with hydrogen-terminated silicon (100) as the desired non-growth surface. We find that as ALD/ALE super-cycles proceed, small changes occur in the ALD and ALE reactions, particularly during the transition from ALD to ALE, or from ALE to ALD. Likewise, a new thermally-driven ALE process for tungsten has been applied in ALD/ALE super-cycles to improve W ASD. In this case, the ALE process alters the ALD surface leading to significant changes in the ALD. Modeling studies allow us to quantitatively analyze the ASD results and compare our findings to other known approaches. These insights will be helpful to understand opportunities and challenges in advanced deposition-based patterning.", "Area selective deposition (ASD) strategies are broadly enabling, where their application is anticipated to impact semiconductor scaling, in the short term, and broadly impact the design of non-traditional hardware such as phase change memory for specialized artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. In order to extend scaling, ASD may be required for the formation of self-aligned structures on patterned substrates that enable schemes, such as fully aligned via. The design of inhibiting materials including small molecule, polymer brushes and area selective surface polymerizations can be tailored to enable the selective deposition of a variety of metal oxide films (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2 or ZnO). The inhibiting materials examined systematically varied inhibitor spacing, composition and surface cleans prior to inhibitor deposition. The examination of a range of materials provides insight into the fundamental mechanisms of inhibition between precursor chemistries and their interaction with surfaces. Furthermore, while the materials generally exploited for inhibition are relegated to small molecules and may require multiple cycles of etch-back processes followed by renewal of the surface inhibitor polymeric materials may offer the potential to access ASD of films with devices that have significant surface topography where they act as effective inhibitors over small molecules. This was achieved with the area selective growth of polymers where the area selective control of a polymerization on a 100nm tall copper line space feature enabled the selective deposition on a silicon dielectric. In addition, while the ASD of some film compositions could not be achieved with polymer inhibitors the ALD on polymer regions of a patterned film increased the porosity of the metal oxide changing the film\u2019s etch resistance, this could be exploited to achieve the area selective etch of metal features.", "Continued reliance on 193nm immersion lithography with multiple patterning is becoming much more difficult as line widths decrease. With the use of Self-Aligned Quadruple patterning and related patterning schemes, it is critical to minimize variability, where high quality films must be deposited and etch rates must be very precise. To this end, a better understanding of spacer material properties must be obtained. Initial work has been performed to examine the resulting film properties for TiO2 and Al2O3 spacer materials deposited by low temperature ALD with the use of various oxidants (H2O2, H2O, O3). Improved film quality has been demonstrated for films deposited with H2O/H2O2 mixtures used as the oxidant. Key to advanced patterning applications is that improved etch resistance is achieved for both Metal Oxide materials. Also significant with regard to multiple patterning is that higher growth rates are obtained at reduced temperatures, enabling lower process temperatures for underlying sensitive materials. The all thermal nature of these deposition methods points toward improved film conformality on 3-Dimensional structures. Improved etch rates and improved electrical properties reflect overall improvements in Metal Oxide dielectric film quality with the use of Hydrogen Peroxide.", "Self-assembled molecules (SAM) are used as an inhibitor in conjunction with atomic layer deposition (ALD) for selective area deposition. Given the extremely thin film and the pattern density involved in this type of process, currently available analytical tools have difficulty in analyzing the quality and selectivity of each processing step. For example, while FTIR may provide evidence of SAM coverage, it cannot assure the quality of coverage, especially on a scale relevant to current processing requirements. Similarly, electron microscopes that can provide excellent spatial resolution and elemental analysis cannot determine the quality of the ultrathin thin organic and selective inorganic deposition layers. In this paper, a relatively new technique called photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM), which combines atomic force microscopy (AFM) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy with sub-10nm spatial resolution, is used to analyze the deposition of SAM layer and subsequent alumina deposition on metal/SiO2 test patterns (80nm being the smallest pitch). PiFM spectra can unambiguously identify the different chemical species (SAM, SiO2, and alumina) via their IR signatures. PiFM images at fixed wavenumbers associated with the different chemical species provide chemical mapping in real space with sub-10nm spatial resolution, clearly illuminating how selective different processing steps are. The paper will show how the nanoscale hyperspectral PiFM data can provide unambiguous and speedy feedback to process engineers engaged in selective deposition.", "Emerging memory devices, such as MRAM, RRAM, and PCM, plays an important role in in-memory computation technology which can lead to significant acceleration for machine learning and AI applications.[1-3] The basic structure of these memory cell is simply a pillar made of a wide range of materials, however, the local CD uniformity (LCDU) of the pillars is especially crucial for these memory devices. The stringent LCDU requirement derives from either the intrinsic small resistance difference between the two memory states or the requirement for creating a large number of memory states within a small range of resistance. Apparently, the stochastic variation in physical dimension will correspond to the variation in resistance from cell to cell, which will affect the correct readout of the memory states and fail the device. Because the \u201clocal\u201d CDU in this context refers to the variation within the memory array, i.e. typically within several um, it is almost impossible to correct by utilizing existing advanced tools or process control techniques. In this work, we will demonstrate four promising options to address the stochastic effect in LCDU of pillars: a) adopting new resists, b) PTD and NTD shrink, c) DSA, d) cross-SADP. Fig. 1 shows the general approach to achieve better LCDU by printing larger CD at litho and shrink by post-litho processing.[4] Here we carefully characterize two shrinking techniques and its efficacy on LCDU improvement. Fig. 2 shows two alternative approaches, i.e. DSA and cross-SADP.[5] We will carefully explore these four approaches for LCDU improvement with thorough characterization and analysis. Subsequent pattern transfer and the retention of the LCDU improvement and cost/quality trade-off will also be discussed. Defectivity learning will also be discussed.", "For the introduction of directed self-assembly (DSA) process into high volume manufacturing, the roughness of pattern is one of main check points. The focus of this study is to understand the origin of DSA roughness and to discuss the strategies to improve DSA-specific roughness. 3X DSA LiNe flow with PS-b-PMMA was used as a model case. Unbiased line edge roughness (LER) and linewidth roughness (LWR) were measured using power spectral density (PSD) analysis on CDSEM images. We found that low frequency LER is particularly sensitive to the assembly conditions. By optimizing material and process conditions, unbiased LWR was reduced by about 10%, while unbiased LER was reduced by about 15%.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) is one of the candidates for next generation lithography. Over the past years, many papers and presentation have been reported regarding DSA, and Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL is a registered trademark or a trademark of Tokyo Electron Limited in Japan and /or other countries.) also has presented the evaluation results and the advantages of each1-9. Especially, the chemo-epitaxy process has advantages for the sub 20nm line & space patterns to apply to active area patterns for DRAM, fin patterns for Logic and narrow pitch of metal patterns. One of the biggest advantages of DSA lines is that the pattern pitch is decided by the specific factors of the block copolymer, and it achieves the small pitch walking as a consequence. In this paper, the latest results regarding the defect reduction work regarding chemo-epitaxy line & space pattern is reported. And, sub-10nm process flow without using high-chi BCP is discussed.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) of Block Copolymers (BCP) by chemo-epitaxial alignment is a promising high resolution lithography technique compatible with CMOS high-volume manufacturing. It allows overcoming limitations in resolution and local stochasticity by conventional, imaging based, lithography. However, for BCP with pitches below 20 nm and guide patterning by immersion lithography (193i), multiplication factors \u2265 4 become necessary, imposing stringent requirements on the guides and defectivity becomes hard to control. The Arkema-CEA (ACE) process flow overcomes this limit by creating the guides by a self-aligned double patterning (SADP) process flow, followed by the deposition of a cross-linkable neutral mat and selective grafting of the guides. This paper reports on the transfer of the process flow to immersion lithography, details challenges encountered in process optimization, notably the dependence of the wetting of the neutral layer on the surface energy and the morphology of the spacers. Last, the paper presents a metrology and defectivity roadmap combined with preliminary, promising results.", "In response to the growing demand for Inpria MOx EUV resists, we have brought online our high-volume manufacturing (HVM) production line, have built the necessary supporting qualified supply chain and have developed the associated quality systems. In this paper we will discuss challenges we overcame in scaling and will review data demonstrating new achievements in reproducibility and stability of MOx photoresists. We will also present recent advances in integrated patterning capabilities for specific use cases of Inpria resists in logic and memory applications on the NXE:3400 as well as an update of resist performance on the EUREKA MET5.", "The development of an EUV photoresist to support high volume manufacturing remains a challenging issue. Meeting the combined resolution, sensitivity, and line width roughness (RLS) requirements has proved difficult. Furthermore, defectivity issues arising from stochastic effects are becoming increasingly critical as pitches decrease. Whilst traditional chemically amplified resists will likely be used initially, a wide range of materials options are being examined for future nodes, aiming to identify a photoresist that simultaneously meets RLS and defectivity requirements. Irresistible Materials (IM) is developing novel resist systems based on the multi-trigger concept. In a multi-trigger resist, multiple elements of the resist must be simultaneously activated to enable the catalytic reactions to proceed. In high dose areas the resist therefore behaves like a traditional CAR, whilst in low dose areas, such as line edges, the reaction is second order increasing the chemical gradient. Effectively there is a dose dependent quenching-like behaviour built in to the resist, enhancing chemical contrast and thus resolution and reducing roughness, whilst eliminating the materials stochastics impact of a separate quencher. The multi-trigger material consists of a base molecule and a crosslinker, which represent the resist matrix, together with a photoacid generator (PAG). Research has been undertaken to improve this resist, in particular focusing on improving resist opacity and crosslinking density. A non-metal atom has been incorporated into the crosslinker and the results presented here show three iterations of this high opacity crosslinker. To improve the sensitivity, a mark II high-Z crosslinker was synthesised which incorporated longer arms compared to the mark I version, to reduce steric hindrance by increasing the distance of the high opacity atom from the reaction site. The results show a dramatic 65% dose-to-size reduction when using the mark II crosslinker. Further exposures investigated the effect of PEB temperature on both the mark I and mark II crosslinkers. This showed that the dose can be reduced by over 50% when using a 90 \u00b0C PEB compared to when using no PEB for the mark I crosslinker but by only 20% for the mark II crosslinker, as would be expected if steric hinderance has been reduced. We present results with the mark II crosslinker showing 16 nm half pitch lines using a 28 nm film thickness with a 90 \u00b0C PEB which results in a dose to size of 19 mJ/cm2 and an LWR of 5.2 nm. A Mark III version is also presented where the chemistry of the Mark I crosslinker has been modified to improve the solubility in industry preferred solvents. We also present work aimed at improving the LWR of the high opacity resist formulation at high resolution, particularly aimed below 16 nm hp using dense lines when patterned using EUV lithography at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland. We present 13.3 nm lines on a 14 nm half pitch, with an LWR of 2.97 nm and dose of 26 mJ/cm2 and 14.7 nm lines on a 15 nm half pitch, with an LWR of 2.72 nm and dose of 34 mJ/cm2", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is in the phase of first generation of high volume manufacturing. Next generation EUV lithography requires further improvement of resist performance such as resolution, sensitivity and pattern roughness. Therefore, it is important to understand deeply both photon and materials stochastic effects for 5 nm node and beyond. Stochastic effects in EUV resist is much sever than that in ArF resist due to less photon number. In this paper, we investigate EUV resist stochastic effect to find suitable material approaches for further improvement. Many research groups have reported that additives such as PAG and Quencher distribution and aggregation in resist film cause resist stochastic. We have also investigated additive distribution and aggregation behavior in EUV-CAR system using advanced resist analysis method. Film analysis result indicates that both additives distribution and aggregation are not main factors causing resist stochastic degradation. To improve resist stochastic, we have been trying to control chemical reaction during and after exposure. As one of our strategy, new type of PAG with high acid yield to utilize EUV photons effectively has been developed. In addition to PAG, we also developed uniform polymer and high contrast polymer for better resist dissolution during development process. Resist systems with new high acid yield PAG and new polymers show excellent resist and defect performance through resist stochastic improvement.", "Metal contaminants are notorious yield detractors throughout semiconductor unit processes. Metallic contaminants can create small, hard-to-detect defects that can eventually result in cone defects and gate leakage. Because these contaminants are so hard to detect, it is extremely difficult to pinpoint their root cause and identify opportunities to remove them. Clean photochemicals experience many contamination opportunities between their final quality control checks at the end of manufacturing and dispense onto a wafer. The complexity of the interactions of metal contaminants and the components in photochemicals is an important consideration when designing removal methods. This challenge increases when metaloxide photoresists are introduced into high volume manufacturing, whereby metals that enhance etch resistance must remain in the formulation, while specific metal contaminants must be removed. In this paper, we will describe different types of metal contaminants in photochemicals and raw materials, review how these contaminants are removed using membrane-based technologies, and define new methodologies to better target metal in photochemicals.", "In EUV lithography, spin-on silicon hardmasks have been widely used not only as etch transfer layers, but also as assist layers to enhance the lithographic performance of resist. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to functionalize spin-on silicon hardmasks by hybridizing them with functional groups through a sol-gel approach. By varying the concentration and type of the functional groups, the structure and property of the hardmasks can be tuned effectively, especially in the aspects of surface energy, elemental composition, and hardness. The lithographic performance of the functionalized hardmasks was evaluated using NXE3300 EUV exposure system to print line-space features with a targeted CD = 16 nm half pitch. Evidenced by the results, when the functionalized hardmasks were used as underlayers, the resist exhibits large processing window with the printable CD ranging from 11.9 to 19.7 nm and a biased 3-sigma line width roughness = 3.73 nm. In contrast, on a non-functionalized spin-on hardmask, no feature can be printed. Finally, the CF4 and O2 plasma etch rates of the hardmasks were tested to evaluate the impact of functionalization on their etch-selectivity.", "The combination photoresist-underlayer fulfills a central role in EUVL for patterning. Moreover, future high numerical aperture (NA) and tight pitches will require very thin layers in the lithography stack, which will increase the impact of chemical interactions at the photoresist-underlayer interface. Adhesion between these layers will be critical to overcome pattern collapse at high aspect ratios whereas at the same time the impact of interfacial effects, such as intermixing, on the lithography performance must be minimized. A fine balance must be found between several chemical interactions, which is a complex exercise with many unknown parameters. In this paper we present how the polar and dispersive components of the surface energy can be used to optimize EUV underlayers in order to achieve the best lithography performance. Subtle changes in the underlayer composition can have a large effect on the lithography performance. A PTD CAR photoresists test case will be used to demonstrate that the photoresist profile, scum formation, line width roughness, pattern collapse and stochastic defects can all be tuned into a certain direction just by tweaking the surface energies of the underlayer. The simplicity of the methodology in this study will be a powerful knob to understand and optimize underlayers for EUV photoresist-underlayer interactions.", "Silicon hardmask (Si-HM) materials used in lithography processes play a critical role in transferring patterns to desired substrates. In addition, these materials allow for the tuning of optical properties such as reflectivity and optical distribution for better lithography. Si-HM materials also need to possess good compatibility with photoresists before and after optical exposure, during which the photoresist in the exposed area may change polarity. Therefore, Si-HM materials may benefit from adaptive or amphiphilic capabilities to keep both exposed and unexposed photoresist compatible with the substrate. In this work, we will demonstrate that Si-HM surfaces may be adaptive or amphiphilic through both experiments and computer simulation. Specifically, we will demonstrate that the functional groups (polar and nonpolar) at the Si-HM surface may be switchable, and the surface will be dictated by the environment to which the Si-HM is exposed. Knowing the adaptive capability of Si-HM materials will greatly facilitate the development of better underlayer materials for improved lithography.", "In the multilayer patterning process, underlayer material is often used to enable device size shrinkage for advanced integrated circuit manufacturing. This underlayer material, spin on carbon (SOC), with high etch resistance plays an important role in both gap fill and process of transferring high aspect ratio patterns. Good global planarization (PL) performance over various pattern topographies not only impacts on the following lithography process window but also boosts the overall device integration yield (Figure 1). As critical dimension (CD) size decreases in the advanced nodes such as 10 nm and beyond with multiple patterning steps, long range planarizing SOC material is needed to control the CD uniformity. During the single coat and single bake process, thermal flow ability of these carbon rich materials is one of the key property to achieve long range planarization performance. In addition, our strategy for designing long distance thermal flow polymers will be applied to both low/high thermal stability SOC materials. Herein, we report the development of a novel planarized SOC materials with good Fab drain line compatibility. As for material global planarization performance, the observation of flow ability can be monitored through the various cure conditions. Other key performance such as gap fill, etch rate toward various gases, solvent strip resistance and cured film thermal stability will be also highlighted in this paper.", "Irresistible Materials has previously introduced the HM340 series of fullerene based spin-on carbon hardmasks, and reported on material characterization, including very high carbon content and high thermal stability. The materials have a low Ohnishi number providing high etch durability and the low hydrogen level allows for high resolution etching without wiggling. In order to further increase semiconductor facilities (Fab) compatibility, thermal stability and etch resistance several new formulations are under development. Here we present the latest results for our new HM1360 series, avoiding the drain test issues encountered with higher concentration HM340 formulations, together with new and updated characterisation results for the more advanced formulations.", "This study focused on the defect behavior analysis with CD variation on EUV via hole pattern using photolithographic process and etch transfer performance. While defect requirements are not as stringent for memory devices, logic devices must be defect-free. Currently, a defect which comes from the process or material can only be detected by top-down inspection approach, however, it is difficult to detect killer defect types such as incompletely opened holes. To develop 5- nm logic node, a hole pattern 15 nm or smaller is required. Identification of failure at the bottom of the hole becomes more challenging. Nevertheless, the process window margin by the amount of dose/focus is not fully explored to find the defect occurrence tendency. So far, there are reported analyses on the scaling of pattern and pitches. In this paper, we examine the process margin quantified by not only by exposure latitude and depth of focus, but also the comprehensive defect \u2013free process window. In our previous study, the behavior of missing-hole type defects was examined and robust defect suppression result was introduced by utilizing a newly developed etching recipe.1,2 In this study, we optimized CD variation and defect reduction comprehensively, to introduce successful improvement results of a wide defect process window with a narrow CD distribution.", "To meet the International Roadmap for Device and Systems (IRDS), the development of an advanced lithography process for next-generation (NG) technology node is a vital and challenging task, as we are reaching to its physical limits. In the progress of high volume manufacturing (HVM) at sub-12 nm node, it is very important that resist materials should possess low line edge roughness (LER) and high sensitivity (E0) using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and its analogous exposure systems. Apart from standard chemically amplified resist (CAR), acid-free non-CAR has been studied immensely as a potential candidate for NG patterning. To achieve sub-12 nm patterns, a complete study for newly developed n-CAR is required to make sure that developed resist formulation is performing optimally. Aside from the n-CARs, we adopted a novel patterning approach using He+ ion beam lithography with less proximity effect. Here we present the metallic nanoparticle photo-multiplier (high optical density materials for \u03bb ~13.5 nm) embedded with n-CAR for better photo-absorption and high-resolution pattern development. The silver (Ag- OD 12 w.r.t Carbon) nanoparticles (NPs) with ~2 nm regime were embedded into MAPDST homo-polymer ((4-(methacryloyloxy)phenyl) dimethylsulfonium trifluoromethanesulfonate). To investigate the high-resolution patterning synthesized photoresist was exposed to e-beam (Ee) and Helium ion (EHe) beam lithography. The patterned samples were developed in aqueous solution and revealed the negative tone with the sensitivity of 172 \u03bcC/cm2 and 50.4 \u03bcC/cm2 for Ee and EHe respectively. The MAPDST-Ag resist found stable for more than 1 year, which clearly suggests that there is no sign of Ag-NPs agglomeration in the formulation. Thence, evidently, prove the considerable shelf life of developed resist formulation and can be used in NG semiconductor device HVM and other electronic device applications.", "In this manuscript, various fluorine-containing BCPs were synthesized by living anionic polymerization or reversible addition\u2212fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The resulted BCPs showed high \u03c7 value > 0.2. With similar \u03c7 value, we observed that PS-typed BCPs formed microdomains of 5 nm within 1 min at 80\u00b0C, whereas polymethacrylate-typed ones required 1 h annealing at 160\u00b0C. When rigid side chain was incorporated into the polymethacrylate block, the annealing time can be shortened to 5 min at 160\u00b0C. However, the poor film formation of the such BCP with rod-like side chain resulted in rough line pattern after the thermal annealing process. The polymethacrylate-typed BCPs generally requires high boiling point solvents for better film formation and better line patterning.", "This paper introduces line roughness characterization non-straight patterns made of block copolymers (fingerprint patterns). Line Width Roughness have been determined using Power Spectral Density based on a special edge detection developed at CEA-LETI to extract edges contours. We investigated several process parameters impact on LWR such as the degree of polymerization of different BCPs and the impact of UV irradiation on the roughness of the PS block.", "Directed Self Assembly (DSA) is a promising technology for complementary patterning in future nodes. As DSA patterning has continued to evolve there has been many efforts to improve defect performance using hardware, processes, and materials. Traditionally, in PS-b-PMMA block-copolymers (BCP) based patterning schemes, phase separation is achieved using a thermal annealing with controlled temperature and time. In previous work we have expanded our understanding of BCP annealing by demonstrating the ability to improve a process window and fingerprint formation of a lamellar system (31nm pitch BCP) by atmospheric condition control during the thermal anneal, as shown in Figure 1. By reducing the oxygen concentration inside the annealing chamber, we have demonstrated improved densities for fingerprint defects commonly associated with phase separation in BCP systems. Furthermore, by achieving a strong regulation of the concentration at different levels, we have achieved a better understanding of what might be required to fully eliminate these defects for subsequent studies and learning toward device manufacture. By reducing the concentration of oxygen during the thermal anneal process, we have been able to employ noticeably higher annealing temperatures without damaging the BCP films. Ultimately, our goal is to provide an annealing solution that is amenable to high volume manufacturing. In this study, controlled oxygen annealing of a 31nm pitch BCP is evaluated against a known thermal annealing baseline. Oxygen concentration, temperature and time are finely tuned in the study. Finally, polymers with different compositions (ie morphologies: lamellar, PS cylinders, PMMA cylinders) are evaluated, and the correlation between thermal budget and polymer stability is reported.", "Block copolymers (BCPs) are appealing materials to the lithography community because of their potential to extend Moore's Law beyond the 10nm node. Not only do BCPs have the ability to microphase separate into structures such as cylinders and lamellae at single-nm length scales, but device fabricators also have control over the alignment of these structures by manipulating the energy landscape of the substrate via directed self- assembly (DSA). Despite the promise that BCPs show in offering an economical enhancement to optical lithography, the levels of defectivity in BCP-patterned devices are still above the desired levels for industrial- scale implementation. A troublesome defect mode that has been observed in experimental BCP structures is the bridge defect. Previous simulation studies by Henderson and coworkers have shown that affinity defects in chemoepitaxial underlayers have the potential to spawn bridge defects in the overlying BCP film. An important consideration in characterizing bridge defectivity is to evaluate and determine which BCP material properties are capable of inhibiting bridge propagation through a BCP film aligned atop an underlayer containing an affinity defect. In this work, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were used to model BCPs with various energetic and structural properties to identify which properties impact bridge propagation. Although there was minimal correlation between BCP properties and bridge propagation, a kinetic survey showed that bridge defects generally reached their maximum thickness within the first 100ns of thermal annealing. As the BCP began undergoing long-range alignment, the bridges slowly healed before reaching an equilibrium thickness of roughly one BCP chain.", "We develop maleimide derivatives named \u201cNeoFARIT N0XX (NFN0XX)\u201d series which show excellent thermal stability as SOC materials. [1] For example, NFN006 shows a slight weight loss <1% at 400\u00baC in the air atmosphere on TG-DTA analysis, and <5% of weight loss at 450\u00baC. However, NFN006 has a problem of high shrinkage during baking process. Sublimates are observed at the thin film forming process with 250\u00baC baking condition, and lead to shrinkage and defects on coating and baking process.\nIn this paper, we report further improved thermal performance of maleimide resin called NeoFARIT N011 (in short NFN011) with lower shrinkage during curing process. The shrinkage of NFN011 in 250\u00baC bake is less <5% in the air although that of NFN006 reaches more than 20%. In addition, NFN011 with no additive is able to form a cured film with low shrinkage due to low sublimation, and shows better thermal stability than cured films using additives.\nOn the other hand, NFN011, which exhibits excellent thermal stability, has a problem of low solubility in PGMEA and PGME, which are commonly used solvent in lithography processes. On this solubility issue, we newly develop NeoFARIT N012 (in short NFN012), which includes a methyl group on the maleimide moiety of NFN011. NFN012 shows both good solubility in PGMEA and sufficient thermal stability. It shows slight weight loss <5% at 450\u00baC in the air atmosphere on TG-DTA analysis. In addition, its shrinkage in 250\u00baC bake is less <5% in the air. We have succeeded in developing a new material that exhibited good solubility in PGMEA and PGME, sufficient thermal stability, and low sublimability.", "As the critical dimension (CD) in semiconductor devices continues to shrink, the multilayer patterning process to transfer fine line patterns into an underlying substrate is becoming increasingly important. The trilayer processes consist of a photoresist film, a silicon-containing layer and a carbon rich underlayer. The distinctive difference in etch selectivity toward fluorine and oxygen based reactive ion etching (RIE) chemistry is critical to provide highly selective pattern transfer to the substrate. In response to the need for high etch resistant underlayers, we have developed carbon rich spin-on carbon (SOC) materials with good solubility in preferred casting solvents, high thermal stability and high dry etch resistance. To better understand structure-property relationships of high etch resistant SOC films, cured SOC films were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray reflectivity (XRR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The design considerations for high etch resistance SOC underlayers, such as Ohnishi parameter, crosslinking and film density, will be discussed in this paper.", "Multilayer lithography is used for advanced semiconductor processes to pattern complex structures. As more and more procedures incorporate a high-temperature process, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the need for thermally stable materials increases. For certain applications, a spin-on carbon (SOC) layer under the CVD layer is required to survive through a high-temperature process. Additionally, these materials are sometimes desired to planarize the underlying topography. Designing organic films that have high-temperature stability while also allowing for good planarization is a challenge. Rigid polymers are typically very stable, but planarizing materials are normally highly flexible, so the trade-off between properties has to be carefully designed. The materials presented in this paper are stable up to 500\u00b0C, soluble in the solvents commonly used in the semiconductor industry, provide void-free fill in high-aspect trenches, and have excellent planarization properties. The coated film has very low shrinkage through the bake temperature and is stable at high-temperature conditions. The planarization on topography in the range from local distance (a few microns), to global distance (a few hundred microns) is equivalent to our best low-temperature SOC.", "As device design scales and becomes more complex, fine control of patterning and transfer steps is integral. Planarization of deep trenches and via arrays has always been a challenge. Aspect ratios continue to increase while critical dimensions shrink, and typical trench fill schemes are no longer able to meet the fill and planarization requirements. Traditional design of spin-on carbon (SOC) materials for planarization normally incorporates low viscosity and high crosslink temperature to allow for the material to thermally flow. However, thermal flow is limited by the force needed to drive this flow, the crosslinking reaction, and the surface tension. This is especially important in deep trenches and vias, where there is a need to move a large amount material. A new type of planarizing material is presented that uses Marangoni effect to pull material to the dense feature area. This force is much stronger than gravity during thermal reflow, and it can be controlled by careful selection of material and process. Based on the structure of substrate, it is possible to adjust the intensity of force and balance with viscosity and flow time to achieve perfect planarization. The technology is not wavelength-specific and could be used in lithography applications from i-line to EUV. The design can also be incorporated into a wide range of SOC platforms for both low- and high-temperature applications.", "The silicon hardmask (Si-HM) is one of the key materials used in multilayer lithography for pattern transfer to a substrate using a fluorinated plasma etching process. Manufacturing of devices with smaller feature sizes introduces new challenges in defect control of all the critical layers, including the Si-HM layer used in photolithography. One of the major challenges of Si-HM materials includes intrinsic defect formations, which can be exacerbated by the presence of foreign contaminants such as soft and hard particles, organics, and metal-ionic contaminants. These contaminants are also known to induce defects by interfering with the plasma etch processes used in advanced patterning technologies. The contaminants can range from microns to angstroms in size. The identification and characterization of the defect adders is important to develop filtration methods capable of minimizing the number of on-wafer defects and consequently improving the quality. In this study, metal contaminants, liquid particle count and on-wafer defects of Si- HMs and filtration removal rates are monitored to determine the effect of filter type, pore size, media morphology, and cleanliness on filtration performance. 5-nm PTFE NTD2 filter having proprietary surface treatment used in this study shows lowest defect count.", "The purification method to produce highly pure products containing siloxane polymer was developed. Siloxane polymer can be difficult to be purified without changing its property because of its high reactivity. Of various methods, ion exchange is well known as a useful method for a purification. However, resins with cation or anion exchange groups used in the purification process can promote hydrolysis and dehydration condensation reaction of siloxane polymer. That is why the method had not been used for the purification of siloxane polymer. In this study, conditions of the ion exchange method were reviewed. As a result, it was found that using strongly acidic cation exchange resins with gel structure is a proper condition. And also simulation models of the polymerization of siloxane polymer and the ion exchange reaction were applied to the purification process. By using these simulations, process parameters of the purification such as process time for ion exchange can be optimized.", "Our earlier studies pointed to a strong correlation between the molecular weight of novolac resin and lithographic characteristics. In particular, they showed that the resolution and DOF characteristics of resists may be improved by controlling molecular weight distribution. The present study focuses on photoactive compound (PAC) structure and resin structure. This paper discusses the effects of differences in PAC ballast structure and the composition of m-cresol (metacresol), p-cresol (para-cresol), and xylenol, phenolic monomers that constitute novolac resin, on resolution and lithographic characteristics, based on development rates and resist pattern simulations.", "The dissolution behavior of a photoresist film is analyzed by a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) in this work. Results show that the existence of a local condensation of a TMAH developer at the interface of the photoresist/glass substrate interface at the initial stage of the photoresist dissolution. The uniformity of the local condensation of the TMAH developer depends on the amount of a remaining solvent in the photoresist film. Moreover, results indicate that the uniform/ununiform penetration path results in the uniform/ununiform local condensation of the TMAH developer. Importantly, the ununiform penetration path and local condensation cause the excessive contacting duration at the edge of an unexposed region of the photoresist which causes to form the photoresist pattern edge roughness. The uniformity of the penetration path of the TMAH developer is critical for the photoresist pattern edge roughness.", "In lithography, peeling and collapse of photoresist patterns cause difficulties of micro fabrication. In order to prevent the destructions, enhancement of adhesion between the photoresist and substrate is effective. Therefore, significance of accurate adhesion analysis increases with miniaturization of device process. The destructions of photoresist/substrate interface can be mainly categorized into interfacial and cohesive failures. In this study, we propose the direct analysis of adhesion in nanoscale area. Using AFM, we estimate adhesion energy of AFM-tip/Si interface in local area and identify the destruction mode of photoresist/Si interface. First, we evaluates the adhesion between photoresist films and surface modified Si substrates. From the surface free energy analysis, the threshold adhesion work, \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\u210e (J/m2) of photoresist/Si interface is estimated to be 71.7 mJ/m2 in order to identify the destruction mode in macro area. Secondary, the interaction between the AFM tip and the surface modified Si substrates are evaluated in the local area less than 10 nm in diameter. The interaction energy, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc3c (J) of AFM-tip/Si interface shows a positive correlation with the adhesion work of photoresist/Si interface. We estimate effective area for adhesion of AFM-tip/Si and adhesion energy, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc34 (J/m2) of AFM-tip/Si in nanoscale area. The results predict that only interfacial destruction occurs at photoresist/Si interface when the adhesion energy of AFM-tip/Si is less than 44.7 mJ/m2. We can expect that the quantitative analysis of nanoscale adhesion contribute to improve the accuracy of nanolithography process.", "Some hybrid inorganic-organic resist materials known as metal-oxo clusters were synthesized and lithographic characteristics were investigated. In particular, the dissolution behaviors of metal oxo clusters were investigated by development analyzer. Our results indicated that the solubility of metal oxo clusters thin films decreased by the exposure to KrF, ArF and electron beam (EB). We clarified the sensitivity in Ti-based oxo clusters was higher than that of Zr-based oxo clusters in both KrF and ArF exposure. The dissolution rate in two kinds of metal oxo cluters was almost same in both KrF and ArF exposure. Furthermore, the dissolution contrast of Ti-based oxo clusters was higher compared to Zr-based oxo clusters. Metal oxo clusters resists have the potential as future negative tone photoresist and EB resist materials.", "The progression of EUV (Extreme Ultra-Violet) lithography into high volume manufacturing is driving the evolution of increased photochemical purity requirements. Further scaling will intensify the challenge to improve inline yield, ensure supply chain integrity, and increase reliability. Si hardmask materials play an important role in pattern transfer, and therefore require strict compositional materials integrity and stability to ensure expected performance. It is therefore critical to assess interactions between Si hardmask materials and components in the chemical delivery system to ensure hardmask materials purity and overall integrity.\nThere has been an increasing demand on filtration technology to enhance material purity in semiconductor unit processes. Many efforts to improve filtration have focused on establishing retention ratings using various particulate contaminants. While this is an important parameter to understand particle removal, it is equally important to understand the fundamental interactions between photochemicals and filters. As materials change and the smallest defects become even more challenging to detect, new filter screening methodologies are needed to address the most stringent defect targets.\nIn this paper, a novel filter screening metrology is introduced to identify optimized filtration candidates for specific defect sources and improve defectivity in Si hardmask materials. Results and possible mechanisms of defect reduction will be discussed.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has gained momentum towards high-volume manufacturing (HVM) as the method of choice for sub-20 nm half-pitch device fabrication. Optimized EUV photoresists and an improved understanding of the EUV patterning mechanisms have made significant progress toward achieving improved resolution, line-width roughness (LWR), and sensitivity. In addition, introducing a thin EUV underlayer (UL) into the regular EUV materials stack enhances the overall performance of EUV resists and opens the process window. As with all other spin-on photochemicals, utilizing filtration at the point-of-dispense can effectively reduce coating defects of the EUV underlayer material.\nIn this paper, we will describe our efforts to leverage different filtration parameters, including retention ratings and membrane materials, to understand their impact on EUV underlayer coating defects, and will present the characterization of coating defects in very thin films.", "NTD (Negative Tone Developer) technology with application of developer to ArF immersion is one of the technologies that is well known and widely used for enabling better optical image contrast. For critical layer processes, CD (Critical Dimension) control is more difficult with narrow trench and contact hole pattern. Since it is difficult to obtain better CDU (Critical Dimension Uniformity) once mask and resist set have been fixed, new NTD processes are required to improve it. CXMT (Chang Xin Memory Technologies) has been continuously developing manufacturing processes based on new NTD method for narrow pattern DRAM process with TEL\u2122 (Tokyo Electron Limited). In this paper, we discuss our work for CDU improvement with new process on Global, Inter, and Intra shot CDU as well as the optimization results of chemical consumption.", "One of the main challenges of a Dual Damascene (DD) via-first process is the control of the Critical Dimensions (CDs) in the lithography of the trenches. The PhotoResist (PhR) thickness presents variations from the via arrays to the open areas, which cause the variation of CDs: the swing effect.\nThe planarization of a DD via-first process is reported. A dual-layer solution is used to demonstrate the complete filling of deeply etched structures and the advanced planarization in a multilayer technique. The first material coating the substrate exhibits a Marangoni effect; the second material owns the same physico-chemical properties of the first one, except for the Marangoni properties.\nThe Marangoni effect of the first coating produces a thicker film in the via array than in the open area, resulting in a negative Film Thickness (FT) bias. Then, the coating with second material is performed and having it standard planarization properties, a positive thickness bias occurs. The addition of these two coatings results in a thickness bias intra-die and on complex topographies, ranging from 0 nm to 30 nm across the wafer. Additionally, the similar physicochemical nature of these two planarization materials enables this dual layer system to be treated as a single homogeneous layer as far as the etching process is concerned.\nIn the perspective of a KrF lithographic process, this dual-layer offers a planar substrate to be coated with the PhR and allows a strong reduction of the intra-die swing effect, providing a scalable solution.", "Since its introduction at Luminescent Technologies and continued development at Synopsys, Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) has delivered industry leading quality of results (QOR) for mask synthesis designs. With the advent of powerful, widely deployed, and user-friendly machine learning (ML) training techniques, we are now able to exploit the quality of ILT masks in a ML framework which has significant runtime benefits. In this paper we will describe our MLILT flow including training data selection and preparation, network architectures, training techniques, and analysis tools. Typically, ILT usage has been limited to smaller areas owing to concerns like runtime, solution consistency, and mask shape complexity. We will exhibit how machine learning can be used to overcome these challenges, thereby providing a pathway to extend ILT solution to full chip logic design. We will demonstrate the clear superiority of ML-ILT QOR over existing mask synthesis techniques, such as rule based placements, that have similar runtime performance.", "Inspired by many success stories of machine learning (ML) in a broad range of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, both industrial and academic researchers are now actively developing ML solutions for challenging problems in computational lithography. In this work, we explore the possibility of utilizing ML software and hardware platforms for mask synthesis applications. Specifically, we demonstrate a standalone mask synthesis flow that runs entirely on the TensorFlow ML platform with a reinforcement learning (RL) approach and GPU acceleration. We will describe the architecture of our ML mask synthesis framework that comprises separable and interchangeable components including neural network (NN)-based 3D mask, imaging and resist models. We will discuss the readiness of these components and present the proof-of-concept evaluation results of the proposed ML mask synthesis framework.", "Achieving stitchless full chip ILT in a day through a combination of mathematics and physics, high performance computing (HPC) methods, GPU acceleration, and tailoring our computational design platform (CDP) to the task is discussed.", "Key factors for maximizing yield in a modern semiconductor fab for Memory device manufacturing include wafer critical dimension uniformity and accuracy control. Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RET) solutions for the highly repetitive arrayed memory devices have been driven by the need for perfect geometric consistency without compromising the lithographic quality. Traditionally, both optical proximity correction (OPC) and sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) insertion for these repetitive cell-array structures have been dealt by applying manual hand-crafted or rule-based methods. But these can be prone to iterative human intervention, long runtimes and sub-par lithographic quality. This work adopts a pattern/property aware approach (PA)2 and cell-array OPC technology that leverage the inherent repetitive and hierarchical structure of the cell-array to ensure the lithographic quality and perfect geometric consistency and symmetry down to the level of feature edges with model-based OPC and rule-based SRAF solutions. The flow also demonstrates a drastic reduction in runtime and turn-around-time to mask tapeouts for the full chip (core and periphery).", "Computational lithography has been playing a critical role in enabling the semiconductor industry. After source mask co-optimization (SMO), inverse lithography has become the ultimate frontier of computational lithography. Full chip implementation of rigorous inverse lithography remains impractical because of enormous computational hardware resource requirements and long computational time, the situation exacerbates for EUV computational lithography where mask 3D effect is more pronounced. One very promising technique to overcome the barrier is to take full advantage of the maturing machine learning techniques based on neural network architecture. Some success has been achieved using deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to obtain inverse lithography technology (ILT) solution with significantly less computational time. In DCNN, to extract features with sufficient resolution and nearly complete representation, the feature extract layers are very complicated and lack of physical meaning. More importantly, the training requires large number of well balanced samples, which makes the training more difficult and time consuming. To alleviate the difficulties relating to DCNN, we have proposed the physics based optimal feature vector design for machine learning based computational lithography. The innovative physics based feature vector design eliminates the need of feature extraction layers in neural network, only layers for mapping function construction are needed, which greatly reduces the NN training time and accelerates the NN model SRAF generation for full chip. In this paper, we will present our machine learning based inverse lithography results with adaptive and dynamical sampling scheme for neural network training.", "The semiconductor design node shrinking requires tighter edge placement errors (EPE) budget. OPC error, as one major contributor of EPE budget, need to be reduced with better OPC model accuracy. In addition, the CD (Critical Dimension) shrinkage in advanced node heavily relies on the etch process. Therefore AEI (After Etch Inspection) metrology and modeling are important to provide accurate pattern correction and optimization. For nodes under 14nm, the etch bias (i.e. the bias between ADI (After Development Inspection) CD and AEI CD) could be -10 nm ~ -50 nm, with a strong loading and aspect-ratio dependency. Etch behavior in advanced node is very complicated and brings challenges to conventional rule based OPC correction. Therefore, accurate etch modeling becomes more and more important to make precise prediction of final complex shapes on wafer for OPC correction. In order to ensure the accuracy of etch modeling, high quality metrology is necessary to reduce random error and systematic measurement error. Moreover, CD gauges alone are not sufficient to capture all the effects of the etch process on different patterns. Edge placement (EP) gauges that accurately describe the contour shapes at various key positions are needed. In this work we used the AEI SEM images obtained from traditional CD-SEM flow, processed with ASML\u2019s MXP (Metrology for eXtreme Performance) tool, and used the extracted CD gauges and massive EP gauges to train a deeplearning Newron Etch model. In the approach, MXP reduced the AEI metrology random errors and shape fitting measurement error and provides better pattern coverage with massive reliable CD and EP gauges, Newron Etch captures complex and unknown physical and chemical effects learned from wafer data. Results shows that MXP successfully extracted stable contour from AEI SEM for various pattern types. Three etch models are calibrated and compared: CD based EEB model (Effective Etch Bias), CD+EP based EEB model, and CD+EP based Newron etch model. CD based EEB model captures the major trend of the etch process. Including EP gauges helps EEB model with about 10% RMS reduction on prediction. Integration of MXP (CD+EP) and Newron Etch model gains about 45% prediction RMS reduction compared to baseline model. The good prediction of Newron Etch is also verified from wafer SEM overlay on complex-shape patterns. This result validates the effectiveness of ASML\u2019s solution of deep learning etch model integration with MXP AEI\u2019s massive wafer data extraction from etch process, and will help to provide accurate and reliable etch modeling for advanced node etch OPC correction in semiconductor manufacturing.", "Sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) are inserted in mask layout to improve the manufacturing process window of main patterns. SRAFs should be large enough to maximize their effect, but they are not intended to be printed on photoresist (PR). An accurate method of SRAF printing prediction is important to assure that no SRAFs are actually printed. We apply a machine learning model, specifically artificial neural network (ANN), for fast and accurate SRAF printing check (named ML- SPC). Polar Fourier transform signals and local layout densities are extracted from each SRAF pixel and its surroundings, and are provided to ANN. The area sum of member pixels that are predicted to be printed is used to determine the final printability of SRAF. Training data is carefully sampled so that similar number of printed and non-printed data are used for training; cost function is adjusted in such a way that missing predictions are treated more importantly than false alarms. When ML-SPC is applied to 10nm memory devices, it achieves 11% of false alarms while popular MTA method reports 24%. In addition, ML-SPC is faster than MTA by about 2.7 times.", "Background: Critical design configurations, so-called hotspots, have limited lithography process margins and are particularly sensitive to mask topography effects. Unfortunately, hotspot inspection at wafer-level is a costly, timeconsuming and non-exhaustive solution. On the other hand, accurate simulation of hotspots implies a very precise representation of the mask 3-D parameters which are challenging to measure directly on a reticle. Aim: In this work, we propose two complementary methods to characterize accurately hotspots without the need for wafer data. Approach: The first approach is based on Zeiss WLCD-2G aerial image metrology tool able to measure 2-dimensional high-resolution aerial images maps of any mask pattern across different focuses. The second approach uses rigorous simulations relying on very accurate mask parameters calibrated beforehand from the complete information contained in these high-resolution aerial images delivered by WLCD Results: The calibration of the mask parameters improves the matching between simulated and WLCD aerial images by almost 20% with an error of 2% (RMS). We showed with a few examples that hotspots discovered during the wafer patterning can be detected and characterized directly at the mask-level from the measured aerial images or from accurate resist simulations. Conclusions: The good matching between the rigorous simulation and WLCD as well as their capacity to predict hotspots cross-validates both methods. The calibration of the mask parameters also indicated that to achieve an even better matching our description of the mask proximity effect has to be more elaborated.", "Corner rounding improvement is critical to device performance, yield, and cell area reduction. In this paper, we present a method to use dual tone sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF) to improve both the outer corner rounding and inner corner rounding which in turn enhance the pattern quality. The simulation data and wafer data are presented. A few parameters have been investigated, such as the position of the SRAF, the shape of the SRAF, resist type and mask tone. The preliminary results show that more than 40% reduction of both inner corner rounding and outer corner rounding can be achieved by placing sub-resolution assist features at appropriate locations. The limit of corner rounding improvement is determined by mask rule check (MRC) and resist sensitivities.", "Typical ILT goes through a continuous tone mask to define a greyscale mask for the best process window, followed by a conversion into actual mask geometries, which are typically Manahttanized to be compatible with printing on existing mask writers. On mask, however, the features to be printed are not Manhattan, and we demonstrate that, by not taking into account the actual mask shapes, current Manhattan mask 3D (M3D) approximations using width, shape, and corner libraries, give rise to poor predictions for the final aerial image. Now that curvilinear ILT is possible to manufacture, we introduce a fully curvilinear mask 3D approximations, compatible with ILT masks, that predict the aerial image significantly better than before.", "We have previously reported the exact convolution-based analytical solution to the problem of an elastic resist shrinkage during post-exposure baking (PEB). In contrast to the PEB problem, the elastic shrinking during development in general does not admit a strict analytical solution. Here we use a numerical finite element method (FEM) to compare a two-step development/shrinking model to the results of simultaneously solving full set of the development equations with the elastic deformations being accounted for. We also report existence of a strict analytical solution for the shrinking of line and space resist patterns; this constitutes a special 2D shrinking case. The results of analytical and numerical solutions are compared, and are shown to agree. In the final section we formulate novel Elastic Compact Model (ECM) that mechanistically captures shrink-induced biases for the resist walls of arbitrary 2D resist patterns. The model is fast and can be used for the full-chip optical proximity corrections (OPC). The accuracy of ECM is analyzed using typical OPC layouts by comparing to FEM results, rigorous simulations, and SEM measurements.", "Lithography simulation is an essential technique for today's semiconductor manufacturing process. Although several rigorous models have been proposed, these methods are time-consuming. In order to calculate a full chip in realistic time, a fast and accurate resist model is essential. This paper proposes a new compact resist model using an arbitrary convolution kernel. The convolution formula can be described as a system of linear equations, therefore, we can determine the convolution kernel by solving the system of linear equations. However, it is hard to find the effective solution, because it is an ill-posed linear inverse problem due to the measurement constraints. Therefore, the key point of our method is how to solve the ill-posed linear inverse problem. In this paper, we explain the details and effectiveness of our method.", "The consideration of wafer topography effects in lithographic modeling of implant layers is mandatory for sub 32nm processes. The approximate assumption that both oxide- and resist thickness are independent of pattern design can lead to large model prediction errors and OPC correction failure. An implant lithography modeling flow based on rigorous models is presented that covers a) the STI stack formation and its etch\u2013proximity effects, b) the resist spin-on and resulting thickness fluctuations, c) the image formation in the modeled stack and d) the chemical characterization of implant photoresist. This approach shows accuracy benefits and will be used to augment the existing OPC correction flow.", "Measuring properties of ultrathin optical films is based on optical interference. Ultrathin films are very challenging to test, because their thicknesses are far smaller than the measuring wavelength, so very little phase shift can be detected. In this work, test sensitivity and accuracy are improved by a rigorous algorithm in which all unknowns {n,k,t} in their full space are fit together without approximations and presumptions. As a result, a software for variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE) data fitting was developed. It gives very reliable ultrathin-film measurement down to 2.5 nanometers. The software not only improves the reliability, accuracy of {n,k,t} measurement, but it also extends VASE capabilities to characterize a film\u2019s optical quality.", "Since its introduction more than a decade ago, inverse lithography technology (ILT) has been seen as a promising solution to many of the challenges of advanced-node lithography. Numerous studies have demonstrated that curvilinear ILT mask shapes produce the best process window. However, the runtimes associated with this computational technique have limited its practical application. In 2019, D2S introduced an entirely new, stitchless approach for ILT [20]. This system includes a unique GPU-accelerated approach that emulates a single, giant GPU/CPU pair that can compute an entire full-chip ILT solution at once. This novel approach, systematically designed for ILT and GPU acceleration, makes full-chip ILT a practical reality in production for the first time. The masks used to validate wafer results for this system were written by a multi-beam mask writer. The question remained of whether it was possible to use this new approach to ILT in a way that could be written by a variable-shaped beam (VSB) mask writer. This paper introduces a new method, in which a process called mask-wafer cooptimization (MWCO) is performed during ILT optimization. This new approach enables curvilinear ILT for 193i masks to be written on VSB mask writers within reasonable write times. It shortens the total turnaround time so that VSB mask writers can produce full-chip, curvilinear ILT masks within a practical, 12-hour time frame, while also producing the largest process windows. It should be noted that this enables curvilinear or any-angle targets for the wafer design to be processed by curvilinear ILT and then written by VSB mask writers for 193i processes. While MWCO as a concept can be used for multi-beam mask writers as well, this paper is focused on MWCO for VSB mask writers.", "Markets continuously demand higher resolution and higher productivity in flat panel display (FPD) exposure systems. Our solution to improve resolution and productivity is the use of broadband wavelength illumination. A larger depth of focus (DOF) is also very important to achieve higher productivity because inadequate DOF can cause product defects. To obtain higher resolution and larger DOF, off axis illumination (OAI) conditions have been widely used. OAIs using a narrowband wavelength illumination are well documented and sufficiently studied. On the other hand, Canon FPD exposure tools use a broadband illumination source to achieve higher resolution and productivity. To obtain sufficient OAI effects in broadband exposure lithography, new technology should be developed with consideration of broadband wavelength because OAI effects are different between broadband and narrowband illumination. In this paper we introduce divided spectrum illumination (DSI), a new design concept proposed to achieve both high resolution and large DOF by optimizing the broadband illumination source wavelength band depending on the illumination angle. Experimental imaging results of line and space patterns with a line width of 1.0-\u03bcm and pitch of 2.0-\u03bcm showed that the DSI design improved resolution. Results showed that test patterns imaged using traditional narrowband OAI could not be resolved at the top of the resist even at the best focus, however resist profiles using DSI were sharp enough to retain pattern fidelity at the top of resist. DOF with DSI also improved 21 % compared to traditional OAI.", "Up to now, Miniaturization has been the main drive for improving the performance of semiconductors. And higher performance of semiconductor has been the drive for applications. But miniaturization has become increasingly difficult due to increased power consumption and variations in characteristics. In order to solve these problems, by not only miniaturization of semiconductor elements, but also heterogeneous integration of the IC chips with advanced packaging technology, the higher performance and functionality improvement of the entire system has been proposed and developed. For example, the integrated SoC of the GPU and the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) via Silicon-interposer(2.5D) are manufactured for high-performance computing, like machine learning and deep learning. With this flow, the wiring of the organic substrate package is also becoming finer line. Furthermore, it is necessary to increase the size of the die. In the following packaging trend, requiring of the Lithography equipment and process for advanced packaging is not only fine wiring to integrate but also large area exposure. In this presentation, we will show the exposure results of various dry film resist by the panel-size lithography system and inspect the state of resolution. The shot size of the lithography system is 250*250mm. Finally, we will discuss the next lithography system and process from the perspective of lithography optics and process.", "To handle upcoming advanced technology nodes, the spec of focus control continues to tighten to satisfy more stringent CD uniformity (CDU). In high volume manufacturing (HVM) nowadays, yield at wafer edge suffers from CDU degradation due to process variation like edge roll-off topography. Advance focus control using diffraction-based focus (DBF) was proposed as one solution; we can apply the focus compensation values, which are determined from DBF measurement. However, the confidence of the focus compensation depends on the accuracy of focus measurement, which is a widely recognized challenge in the industry. In this paper, we have investigated the performance and the accuracy of two different designs of DBF marks by collecting full maps of DBF measurements. The measurement shows different signatures cross wafer from the two designs. For focus accuracy validation, CDU maps of several focus sensitive patterns have been collected and analyzed against the defocus measurement results. Our results demonstrate that with the accuracy improved DBF design and focus correction per exposure (CPE) schematic, the CDU is improved by 20%, at the wafer edge. We find that the dimension of the DBF main pattern (W1) dominates the accuracy of focus measurement. A DBF design guideline is proposed that the main pattern dimension (W1) should be close to device focus sensitive pattern size to capture its defocus signature more effectively. The accuracy of focus measurement benefits from designs that are close to device weak point patterns, which in turn improves the overall CD uniformity.", "Over the years, lithography engineers have continued to focus on CD control, overlay and process capability to meet node requirements for yield and device performance. The use of ArFi lithography for advanced process nodes demands challenging patterning budget improvements in the sub-nm range.1 In 3D NAND devices, the height differences between the cell and periphery create issues with the ability to adequately image and maintain a useable process window in both regions. Previous work by Fukuda2 developed a multi-exposure technique at multi-focus positions to image contact holes with adequate DOF. Lalovic3 demonstrated a fixed 2 wavelength technique to improve DOF called RELAX. ASML introduced EFESE Rx, a method of tilting the stage during exposure to create multiple focus positions and finally Lalovic4 introduced a broadband laser solution to provide additional DOF. All of these techniques suffered from a number of problems that limited usability. In this work the authors will introduce a new method to increase DOF through alternating wavelength\u2019s from an ArFi light source. This technique, called MFI (multi-focal imaging), can be tuned specifically to provide the required amount of wavelength separation for a specific DOF need. Two focal positions are created that are averaged over the exposure field. The authors will review this wavelength \u201cdithering\u201d approach which can be turned on and off, thus eliminating any potential scanner calibration issues. Initial simulation studies with a fixed source and mask indicated increased DOF with wavelength separation. These DOF improvements have been confirmed with on-wafer single-exposure data. The Tachyon MFI aware engine flow will be reviewed using several customer use cases that have been analyzed to demonstrate maximum DOF and ILS vs wavelength separation. The authors will also review the optimization of new pupils and OPC solutions that are unique with each wavelength separation case and maximize process capability. The presentation will close with a product availability timeline and roadmap.", "In world-leading semiconductor manufacturing, the device feature size keeps on reducing and with it processes become more challenging in the next technology node. The on-product overlay budget is therefore required to reduce further. Alignment is one of the key factors in reducing overlay wafer-to-wafer variation. Due to the complexity, a holistic methodology is used to combine various alignment solutions to achieve the optimal on-product overlay performance. In this paper, we evaluated the holistic method by simulation and experiment for DUV layers. We illustrate the expected on-product overlay improvement.", "Even with the large-scale adaption of EUV Lithography to High Volume Manufacturing, numerous device-critical product layers will still be exposed with Immersion Lithography Technology and therefore ZEISS and ASML keep investing in the next generation immersion extensions. The overlay accuracy has to be controlled over the exposure field more accurately and also on a higher spatial frequency grid. To support this functionality, a novel manipulator will be incorporated into the next generation of immersion optics, which is especially well-suited for high frequent distortion tuning. Furthermore, lens distortion measurements and adjustments will be done based on more field points. In this paper, we will show the unique correction functionality of this manipulator and show its various application fields for improving the performance of ASML scanners.", "In leading-edge lithography, field-by-field corrections, also known as corrections per exposure, are well established. Many manufacturers use a combination of the traditional higher order wafer and intrafield polynomial corrections, combined with linear field-by-field corrections. However, non-linear wafer deformations are usually strongest at the wafer edge. Therefore, specific high order field-by-field corrections are the ultimate correction method to mitigate the effects of these non-linear wafer deformations. However, determining the appropriate amount of high order field-to-field corrections is not trivial. At the wafer edge, exposure fields are often incomplete, so the fields contain less overlay marks and have a less regular distribution than fields that are completely on the wafer. Therefore, even on dense measurements, it is challenging to model these fields with a high order model without applying overcorrection. On the other hand, the metrology capacity for dense measurements is high, so these can typically only be performed with low frequency. Alternatively, smart field-by-field modeling algorithms are available to compute higher order effects based on reduced sampling plans. In this paper, we study different algorithmic approaches to optimize modeling algorithms for both dense and sparse (reduced) sampling plans. We compare the impact of varying the frequency of dense sampling to the performance of different modeling algorithms on sparse sampling.", "In most leading-edge technologies, first layers usually are more critical than later layers. For some technologies, however, most critical layers are in mid-of line. On such technologies, less advanced equipment is used for first layers. Because such tools are not so stable, the overlay variation must be compensated on advanced tools used for later layers. Wafer-to-wafer variation is typically corrected by wafer alignment. By standard wafer alignment, intra-field variations are usually not corrected. Because of the instability of the older tools, additional marks to compensate intra-field variation were measured on advanced tools. This reduces the wafer-to-wafer variation but causes throughput loss. Therefore, sampling plans were optimized to reduce the number of intra-field marks by 50%. This was verified by run-to-run simulations and experiments.", "Demand for on-product overlay (OPO) improvement is becoming increasingly crucial in semiconductor manufacturing. Alignment sampling plan is closely linked to OPO. However, alignment sampling plan is constrained by productivity. Inline Alignment Station (iAS) is the groundbreaking system which enable dense alignment without throughput impact. Remaining linear and high order grid of OPO can be corrected with iAS correction. iAS is a measurement tool placed inline with NSR and has its own measurement stage. Therefore, it is possible to measure dense sampling without throughput impact. However, matching two stages generally pose some difficulties. Chucking deformation of wafer is one of the challenging factors. We have overcome the problem by integrating new methods. In this paper, we introduce the detail of the method and show some actual results.", "Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) is being applied to 7nm technology node and below for back-end metal layers (routing layers) with pitches down to ~40nm. Unlike the traditional litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE) approach, SADP splits pitch using spacers whose 2nd pattern (Color-B) is self-aligned to its 1st pattern (Color-A). As a result, the SADP approach produces less variation than LELE approach by removing the second pattern misalignment on Si. Although SADP provides better overlay controllability than LELE, it still encounters many challenges. One of the challenges is controlling the 2nd patterning linewidth and uniformity. In general, the Color-B critical dimension (CD) has a larger variation than Color-A CD in the SADP process using Mandrel structure. In this paper, we investigate variations to the SADP Color-B CD based on self-aligned litho-etch litho-etch (SALELE) process flow, including the lithographic CD uniformity, hard mask etching, spacer etch and final Si etch. The corresponding contribution to Color-B CD variation is analyzed each step. After the major contributors to Color-B variation are identified, an experiment was designed to reduce Color-B pattern variation during the process. The silicon results show that compared with the old process condition, the new process can reduce Color-B variation significantly. With this new process, Color-B variation is comparable to Color-A variation.", "As the most aggressive features in advanced memory designs continue to shrink, so does the overlay budget. The number of layer stacks also creates unwanted topography, and the alignment robustness of lithography tools becomes much more important for on-product overly. Canon developed a through-the-mask moir\u00e9 alignment system for the FPA-1200NZ2C nanoimprint lithography (NIL) system allowing high-speed measurement of several alignment marks within each imprint field and alignment compensation to be completed during the imprinting sequence. To provide increased process flexibility and overlay accuracy while maintaining high-productivity, we have developed a new low-noise and high-resolution moir\u00e9 diffraction alignment system based on spatial phase interferometry. In this paper, we report on the TTM detection system used in FPA-1200NZ2C. In particular, the principle of moir\u00e9 detection and the improvement of the detection method will be described. The measurement error of moir\u00e9 is analyzed by a simplified model calculation and we confirmed the relationship between process change and alignment error. Results of analyses proved that selection of the wavelength are key factors for optimizing alignment accuracy. Based on these results we applied the following improvement items: 1) Dual Dipole illumination, 2) Optimization of the alignment wavelength. We evaluated the new alignment system measurement error by comparing the moir\u00e9 measurement value with the measured overlay values for 24 wafers and confirmed that new TTM alignment system can reduce to the measurement error more than 40%. The data shows that our moir\u00e9 measurement system can provide process robustness and can support mass-production of leading-edge memory products.", "UVLED array aligner for proximity and soft contact exposure has been designed and fabricated.

Synopsys\u00a9 has developed new source mask optimization tool Proteus SMO that demonstrated this improvement. Proteus SMO is equipped with comprehensive functionalities for computing the optimum source and mask. High flexibilities of source types, mask recipes, models, optimizers, and cost functions are provided. For enabling accurate simulation results, integration of Sentaurus Lithography (S-Litho) is also possible when needed. Moreover, the industrial-proven Inverse Lithography Technology (Proteus ILT) mask synthesis is integrated within Proteus SMO further maximizing the process window. Taking advantage of ILT and SLitho simulation solutions, Proteus SMO could achieve significant lithographic performance improvement.", "In modern semiconductor lithography world, doubtlessly, scanners using DUV as light source still be main work horses to push physical limits of semiconductor devices to a new level. Meanwhile, as the semiconductor devices diversified to many different types, for example, logic, DRAM, NAND ash, CMOS Image Sensor (CIS), etc., lithography performances needed are also diversified. For example, CH/VIA layers in the-state-of-the-art logic processes require improved lithography Process Window (PW) due to their shallow Depth of Focus (DOF). On the other hand, engineers working in the field of modern 3D-NAND ash memory and CIS lithography are needed to deal with problems induced by thick resists. Efforts by chip makers, scanner vendors solved the problems in some degree. For example, focus drilling multi-exposure, has improved DOF of some specific layers substantially. But all these approaches have some kinds of issues, such as, throughput losses, etc. As a light source maker, we believe we can make unique contributions to solve the issues. In this report, we are going to show that our advanced Spectral Engineering (SE), a cost-effective way, can provide chip makers with an alternative to cope with the challenges stated above.", "Semiconductor demand is steadily growing which is driven by the growth of electronics market used for automobiles to finance, medical to industrial use including agriculture in the last few years. Therefore, the challenges of productivity improvement amongst semiconductor manufacturers are higher than ever. In order to meet that challenge, Gigaphoton has been developed emerging technologies to extend the module replacement interval and reduce the maintenance time along with module life extension. Furthermore, Preventive Maintenance (PM) cycle on the light source is significantly important in order to improve productivity efficiently, that\u2019s why Gigaphoton is focusing to develop technologies for module replacement interval extension not only module base life cycle PM, takes into account PM cycle reduction As implementing new approach for effective PM event managing, Gigaphoton introduced \u201cAvailability Maximization(here in afer \u201cAMAX\u201d) as software solution in providing best effective tool utilization aka availability maximization solution to be provided to Semiconductor manufacturer which is operated on FABSCAPE platform. Semiconductor manufacturers are able to create PM planning in terms of both tool availability maximization and scheduled PM which can be aligned to other equipment, fab situation in order to utilize fully productivity in wafer output.", "Source optimization (SO) is a widely used resolution enhancement technique to improve the imaging performance of optical lithography systems. Recently, a fast pixelated SO method for inverse lithography has been developed based on the theory of compressive sensing (CS). In last several years, CS has explored numerous reconstruction algorithms to solve for inverse problems. These algorithms are critical in attaining good reconstruction quality also aiming at reducing the time complexity. This paper compares different SO methods based on CS algorithms including the linearized Bregman (LB) algorithm, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA), the approximate message-passing (AMP), and the gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR). Benefiting from the strategy of variable splitting and adaptive step size searching, the GPSR method effectively retains the optimization efficiency. Computational experiments also show that the GPSR method can achieve superior or comparable SO performance on average over other methods. It is also shown that the proposed SO methods can be applied to develop a fast source-mask optimization (SMO) method based on the CS framework.", "Multiple patterning ArF immersion lithography has been expected as the promising technology to meet tighter leading edge device requirements. To enhance the resolution and productivity for multiple-patterning application, key light source performances are spectral bandwidth stability and wavelength stability. The increased spectral bandwidth stability contributes to more precise critical dimension (CD) control and improves device yield. The increased wavelength stability can realize accurate focus and improve overlay accuracy. Our new spectral bandwidth control module improves E95 spectral bandwidth stability. The spectral bandwidth has deviations by thermal history with light source operations. It should be always controlled tightly even after a quiescent interval, such as wafer loading. In our laser system, a spectral bandwidth is controlled by adjusting the wavefront of a laser beam using a two-lens optical system within a resonator. A high speed actuator equipped the movable lens enables E95 spectral bandwidth stability to be less variation. New designs of drive mechanism suppress the lens vibration and spectral bandwidth error. This technology enables 3-sigma of E95 spectral bandwidth field average to be under 5 fm. This large shrinkage for E95 spectral bandwidth stability is the key to improve larger focus budgets for a leading edge processes. A new designed line narrowing module (LNM) improves wavelength stability. The wavelength is controlled by changing the rotation of a beam expander prism using actuator. Wavelength stability is improved further by the anti-vibration structure of the actuated prism in the LNM. The new design prism holding mechanisms reduce the mass of actuator load. This increases the stiffness of the system and suppresses the vibration of the prism rotation. New LNM reduce wavelength stability about 20%. The improvement in wavelength stability contributes to accurate focus and overlay. In addition, the lifetime of LNM is extending to reduce the Cost of Operation (CoO) and the light source downtime. A new ArF excimer laser, GT66A, maximizes device yield, process productivity and minimizes the operational costs for chipmakers.", "The impacts of aberrations to lithographic metrics, such as defocus, pattern shift and NILS loss, needs to be calculated quickly in numerous applications of the lithography. This paper presents a fast algorithm for calculating these typical lithographic metrics of scanner. Based on the principal component analysis (PCA) of the aberrated lithographic image, the quadratic regression relationship between the principal component (PC) coefficients and Zernike coefficients is established. The quadratic imaging model (QIM) and the gradient information of all PCs are used to calculate the lithographic metrics. Meanwhile, in order to characterize the impacts of spatial varying aberrations on scanning image and the corresponding lithographic metrics, the integral transfer function is used to calculate the PC coefficients of the aberrated scanning image.", "Overlay and alignment target recovery process is often required in recording head fabrication where targets are covered by opaque materials. In this study, we have investigated the recovery process impact on the image based overlay (IBO) measurement performance in critical stages of the recording head fabrication. The trench topography created by the target recovery process can result in the asymmetric resist coating uniformity across the wafer and result in errors in the measured overlay values and modeled correctable wafer terms such as the scale and rotation. These errors become significant at critical pattering layers when there is a large z-spacing between the current resist overlay mark and the previous overlay reference mark layer. The recovery pattern size and the recovery depth impact on the measured overlay performance are evaluated. The overlay mark needs to be optimized to reduce the overlay measurement variation. Overlay mark designs, including box-in-box, AIMid and multi AIMid overlay marks, are investigated. Self-referencing marks (SRM) are used to evaluate recovery process and overlay mark impacts on overlay measurement accuracy.", "A proof-of-concept Krypton Fluoride excimer laser-based patterning system was designed and constructed with dual applications in lithography and laser-ablation patterning. For the lithographic patterning application, utilizing a typical positive-tone chemical amplification resist material, potential for sub-\u03bcm patterning was realized with ultimate resolution obtained at 0.8\u03bcm 1:1 lines-and-spaces (L/S). Moreover, extremely large depth-of-focus was confirmed, e.g. 50\u03bcm at 5\u03bcm 1:1 L/S. For the laser-ablation patterning application, ultimate resolutions of up to 1.2\u03bcm 1:1 L/S were obtained using a novolac-based material. It was also understood that higher exposure energy per shot can aid in pattern profile enhancement. Results obtained here show the potential of the patterning system for \u03bcm and sub-\u03bcm level patterning of thick resist films.", "Over the past few years, patterning edge placement error (EPE) has been established as the key metric for patterning budget generation. In previous work [1] it has been shown that local variability of contact within 28nm node SRAM regular array accounts for more than 90% of total variability. Among the most obvious source of local variability, we can think of optical proximity correction (OPC), mask process, wafer process (litho and etch). If one would like to make breakdown between these sources, process related sources will be very measurement consuming to characterize, and even more complex to correct. On the opposite, OPC can be characterized computationally as well as corrected. Therefore, this paper proposes a computational method to evaluate and correct pattern variability induced by OPC within regular array layout. In a different field of application, array of pixels in imager SoC is very sensitive to pattern variability, especially when it is periodic. This is known as MURA effect, and many works have shown this effect in the field of flat panel display [2]. The challenge is similar in the field of image SoC. Once again, OPC variability is also a contributor to this effect. Therefore, array of pixels is also benefitting from the method proposed in this paper.", "N2 node is introduced at 42nm poly pitch (CPP), 16 metal pitch (MP) by using 5 tracks (5T) cell height, single fin, and buried power rail (BPR). Due to the extreme cell height reduction, the patterning of the middle of line (MOL) become challenging. In this paper, two contact patterning schemes, staggered and aligned are presented and evaluated in terms of their impact on electrical performance on FinFET and Nanosheet. Simulations show that both options meet the performance target for N2. However, scaling at these dimensions also challenges the p-n separation between devices in a logic cell, which results in area penalty in complex cells. A novel device is introduced at N2 node, Forksheet, which shows higher performance and better area scaling at standard cell level compared to FinFET and NanoSheet.", "At the core of Design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) processes, is the Design Space Exploration (DSE), where different design schemes and patterns are systematically analyzed and design rules and processes are co-optimized for optimal yield and performance before real products are designed. Synthetic layout generation offers a solution. With rules-based synthetic layout generation, engineers design rules to generate realistic layout they will later see in real product designs. This paper shows two approaches to generating full coverage of the design space and providing contextual layout. One approach relies on Monte Carlo methods and the other depends on combining systematic and random methods to core patterns and their contextual layout. Also, in this paper we present a hierarchical classification system that catalogs layouts based on pattern commonality. The hierarchical classification is based on a novel algorithm of creating a genealogical tree of all the patterns in the design space.", "In this paper, we propose methodologies used in a software system for checking process friendliness (including lithography friendliness) and routability (including pin accessibility) of standard cells. In the process of designing physical layouts of standard cells, it is essential to consider their process friendliness since specific cells have very high tendencies to create process weakpoints (which include lithography hotspots) after their instances are placed and routed. On the other hand, at advanced process nodes, the routability of standard cells must also be considered since there are combined trends of increasing pin densities and increasing design rule complexities. Experimental results show that our software system is able to effectively detect problematic standard cells which have critical process friendliness and/or routability issues.", "As traditional pitch scaling is losing steam, 3D logic is being explored to further extend density scaling as an alternative to continued standard cell scaling. This paper will discuss standard cell architectures to be used in a Sequential 3D process where the SoC is comprised out of 2 or more tiers of active CMOS with a given BEOL metal stack per tier. Using backside interconnect metals as standard cell power rails, a smart partitioning of the metal usage within standard cells can be obtained leading to 4 track cell height scaling. A design abstraction using crenelated design is however needed at block level to mitigate via and metal line end conflicts.", "Gate all around stacked nanosheet FET\u2019s have emerged as the next technology to FinFET\u2019s for beyond 7-nm scaling. With EUV technology integrated into manufacturing at 7nm, there is great interest to enable EUV direct print patterning for nanosheet patterning as a replacement to complex double patterning schemes. While front-up sheet pitches and gate pitches expected for the beyond 7nm node fall well within the EUV direct print regime (>40nm), it is unclear if direct print solutions can meet variation requirements at technology minimum sheet widths and gate lengths. Here, we explore the crossover point between direct print EUV and optical/EUV based double patterning processes for sheets and gates in the 40 \u2013 50 nm sheet pitch/CPP regime. We demonstrate that to enable the minimum sheet widths of <20nm required for the technology, direct bright field print with shrink results in high variability. We develop a tone invert process with darkfield sheet print that utilizes a polymerizing etch to reduce variability and achieve sub-20nm sheet widths with reduced variability, comparable to a self-aligned double patterning (SADP) process. With gate length variation requirements being tighter, we show that SADP still yields a considerable improvement in line edge/width roughness over a direct print process. We project EUV technology into the future to quantify improvements that would enable direct printed gates that match SADP. Our results will provide a guideline to down-select patterning processes for the nanosheet front end while optimizing cost and complexity.", "An efficient Pathfinding DTCO analysis flow which allows rapid block-level power, performance, and area (PPA) characterization is presented. To optimize this flow for the exploration of innovative technology-architecture definitions, i.e. new devices and their integration into functional logic cells, the time consuming task of generating and validating a process design kit (PDK) for each technology definition is eliminated by taking advantage of automated standard cell generation and direct emulation-based parasitic extraction. Further efficiency gains are obtained through a customized flow that allows a large number of place and route (PnR) experiments to be executed automatically. The efficiency of the presented Pathfinding DTCO flow is demonstrated in experiments quantifying block-level PPA changes in different implementations of finFET and CFET devices.", "With multi patterning being the method of choice for pushing technology further down the shrink roadmap, new design weak points are emerging that have multi-layer components and are difficult to find and to define. On the other hand, advanced OPC methodologies like retargeting and recentering help alleviate many of the occurrences, leaving only a few locations that are critical and need to be dealt with in design. State of the art in-design weak point auto fixing is usually done by identifying a weak point by a pattern match, and providing the router either a \u201csafe\u201d alternative configuration or tell it to reroute locally, also called rip-and-reroute. The dilemma for developing pattern matching decks that are used in place and route tools is that one cannot be too specific in the pattern definition as there will be escapes that can possibly cause problems in the fab. Having a more general pattern definition will prevent escapes, but will flag many locations that don\u2019t really require fixing. As a consequence, this more general pattern definition may bog down the place and route tool and can actually result in area bloat if too many rip-and-reroute areas are identified. We have come up with a patented flow that allows very specific weak point detection with a low escape rate. The flow starts with a generic pattern definition of the fail mode, but reduces the number of occurrences by identifying safe configurations. Usually, the pattern extent of the safe configuration is larger than the initial generic pattern, and may contain more layers. Any known safe configuration is added to a \u201cgood pattern\u201d database which is then subtracted from the initial pattern match. Thus, the number of design locations that need to be auto fixed is kept at a minimum. As the technology matures, more safe patterns are found and added to the database, thus reducing the amount of auto fixing required.", "As feature sizes diminish and correction flow complexity increases, it becomes extremely difficult to create homogeneous mask synthesis correction recipes that can pass lithographic verification without some failing hotspots. When encountered in the production line, these areas are frequently fixed quickly so the tapeout can resume and time-tomask is preserved as much as possible. However, these hotspots may occur in future designs, so it is beneficial to update the standard correction recipe with this hotspot information and avoid verification failures before they occur. This paper examines inserting unique hotspot corrections into the standard correction flow using pattern matching to identify the hotspot areas. Standard correction recipes can be updated to accept these hotspot areas and adjust recipe parameters or correction techniques in a standard manner so that these hotspots will be fixed automatically. This automation technique minimizes human interaction with the recipe.", "In this paper, we are proposing different techniques to enhance the printability of 2D shapes at 3nm node of Block/Cut shapes in self-Aligned Multi-patterning approaches. Multiple directions such as OPC optimization, fragmentation optimization, tagging, optimization of 2D shapes dimensions, controlling the direction of movement of OPC mask edges, using skew edges and more approaches are used to meet the printability specs of 3 nm node. In addition, a complete study to define the best dimensions to 2D junction of block/cut shape and its distance from metal line has been conducted. The results are evaluated based on the resulted EPE and PVBand. We managed to reach EPE< 1nm and PVBand < 3nm (IMEC specs at 3nm node).", "Semiconductor foundries typically analyze design layouts for criticality as a precursor to manufacturing flows. Risk assessment is performed on incoming layouts to identify and react to critical patterns at an early stage of the manufacturing cycle, in turn saving time and efforts. In this paper, we describe a new bottom-up approach to layout risk assessment that can rapidly identify unique patterns in layouts, and in combination with techniques like feature filters, location mapping and clustering, can pre-determine their criticality. A massive highly performant pattern database of single and multilayer patterns, along with their features and locations, forms the core of the system. While pattern analyses may be pertaining to the short range of design space, silicon defects and simulations extend to a much larger scope. Therefore, the database is extended to defect data extracted from Silicon inspection tools like Bright Field Inspection (BFI) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). When stored in an optimized manner, it can aid fast and efficient large data analysis and machine learning within critical tapeout review time which is typically a few days. Machine learning combined with design feature filters can then be used for anomaly detection and failure prediction at layout, layer and pattern levels. As a result, outlier patterns can be visually reviewed and flagged for custom targeted simulations and silicon inspection. Further, adding new layout patterns to the pattern database will make it possible to repeat this exercise for subsequent new layouts.", "Process and reliability risks have become critically important during mass production at advanced technology nodes even with Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) illumination. In this work, we propose a design-for-manufacturability solution using a set of new rules to detect high risk design layout patterns. The proposed methods improve design margins while avoiding area overhead and complex design restrictions. In addition, the proposed method introduces an in-design pattern replacement with automatically generated fixing hints to improve all matched locations with identified patterns.", "Design technology co-optimization (DTCO) is one of the most critical considerations for yield breakthrough and product ramp-up during the life cycle of a new technology node. Traditional sign-off flow of physical verification cannot guarantee manufacturability totally. Comprehensive design for manufacturing (DFM) check should be involved in flow of product tape-out in order to recognize the patterning and other process challenges which would limit the wafer yield. The process related hotspots were pre-defined with the aid of process related simulation kits on cell, block as well as full chip levels. A systematic DTCO methodology including fabless process friendly flow with lithography friendly design (LFD), pattern match and chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) check, resolution enhancement technology (RET) synthesis, process window check for sensitive patterns as well as weak pattern library assisted circuit diagnosis was as an example of DTCO application at 14/12nm in this paper.", "A symmetry-aware DFM layout insertion flow for matched circuits is developed for enhancing analog and mixed-signal designs. Pattern capture is used to categorize the matched circuits to unique groups of layout patterns and store them in a pattern database, in which each pattern has an associated group identification, a match location, a region of extent, and a symmetry constraint. Using the stored information in the pattern database, DFM layout insertions are applied to the base pattern and replicated for the symmetric patterns to generate an optimized layout, thus preserving the original symmetry. The impact of the DFM insertions on analog circuit performance was quantified using electronic simulators. The application of symmetry-aware DFM enhancements to analog designs achieves nearly 100% DFM compliance with negligible 0.1-0.2% impact to analog electrical parameters.", "Computational technologies are still in the course of development for nanoimprint lithography (NIL). Only a few simulators are applicable to the nanoimprint process, and these simulators are desired by device manufacturers as part of their daily toolbox. The most challenging issue in NIL process simulation is the scale difference of each component of the system. The template pattern depth and the residual resist film thickness are generally of the order of a few tens of nanometers, while the process needs to work over the entire shot size, which is typically of the order of 10 mm square. This amounts to a scale difference of the order of 106. Therefore, in order to calculate the nanoimprint process with conventional fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulators, an enormous number of meshes is required, which results in computation times that are unacceptable. In this paper, we introduce a new process simulator which directly inputs the process parameters, simulates the whole imprinting process, and evaluates the quality of the resulting resist film. To overcome the scale differences, our simulator utilizes analytically integrated expressions which reduce the dimensions of the calculation region. In addition, the simulator can independently consider the positions of the droplets and calculate the droplet coalescence, thereby predicting the distribution of the non-fill areas which originate from the trapped gas between the droplets. The simulator has been applied to the actual NIL system and some examples of its applications are presented here.", "As one of Resolution Enhancement Techniques, a mask optimization such as Pixel-based Optical Proximity Correction or Inverse Lithography Technology is well discussed. In this paper, a pixel-based mask optimization using 0-1 Quadratic Programming problem (0-1 QP) is proposed to obtain enough image contour fidelity and tolerance to process variation in a short time. By formulating 0-1 QP to maximize intensity slope around between edges of target patterns, suppression of image contour distortion by the process variation is realized. The defined 0-1 QP is relaxed into Lagrangian relaxation problem and an approximate solution of the defined 0-1 QP is obtained by solving Lagrangian relaxation problem by using Subgradient method and gradient deciding method. Moreover, by applying a correction method which corrects boundary pixel of target patterns precisely into the mask obtained by 0-1 QP, enough shape fidelity toward target patterns can be obtained.", "CMOS technology scaling is enabled by multiple logic transistor architecture change from Planner to FinFET to Nanosheet and most recently Forksheet and CFET. Every architecture change has significant impact on the power-performance-area (PPA) scaling of any system on chip (SOC). A comprehensive Design-Technology-optimization (DTCO) methodology is needed to analyze this impact. In this paper technology scaling impact of this architecture change along with lithographic scaling will be analyzed from standard Cell to Block Level Place-Route to realize realistic PPA estimate.", "Fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) circuits provides unique advantages of being of low power, or high performance, or a combination of both if properly deployed. The tradeoff is that designers need to take steps to ensure interference between circuit blocks of different voltage domains, and antenna damages do not occur. This paper describes an efficient design, which combines guard rings and antenna diodes into one, to resolve these potential issues.", "Current Wafer-to-Wafer hybrid bonding process technology allows die stacking with 3D structure pitches in range of 1\u03bcm. Independent wafer processing prior to 3D stacking enables heterogeneous CMOS process integration, where each wafer FEOL, BEOL can be optimized for a given functionality to trade-off system performance and cost. Typical functional system partitioning aims the split of the system memory from the logic. While 3D structures with coarser pitches (e.g. micro-bumps) are already used to split the last-level cache (LLC) from the rest of the system (e.g. HBMs), finer 3D structures can be used to split lower and intermediate cache memory layers (L2, L1) from the core logic. System performance gets better since delay and cache latency can be reduced. Also the system cost can be reduced, since only the core layer is now built using the most expensive CMOS process. In this article we quantify the system-level post place and route performance and area benefits of Memory-on-Logic applications using advanced CMOS processes (< 10nm) for various BEOL configuration options, i.e. the number and geometrical properties of different metal layers used in the BEOL stack.", "For over ten years, lithographers have been attempting to use ILT to maximize the wafer process window. Only recently has the ability been available to manufacture the curvilinear ILT reticles. It has recently been shown that migrating the mask data to a purely curvilinear path (avoiding Manhattanization after ILT output) maximizes wafer process yield by minimizing mask variability. Therefore, the last two steps of the design+manufacturing flow can be done in a completely curvilinear way. It is now time to extend these ideas to design itself. It has been demonstrated earlier that these designs can reduce the number masks needed for a device. We will show the ability to achieve better device behavior by requesting more manufacturable shapes. As part of this we will suggest how to update the existing Manhattan design rule check (DRC) rules with curvilinear ones.", "The edge placement error (EPE) of a 5nm node SRAM is examined in detail for aligning a via 0 (V0) layer to the metal 0 (M0) layer. These layers are optimized with source mask optimization, and the EPE is minimized from stochastics, global critical dimension uniformity (CDU), overlay, optical proximity correction (OPC) error, and scanner matcher error. The largest source of error in EPE is from stochastic EPE (SEPE) in which 5nm of maximum EPE is produced. Tradeoffs can be made to sacrifice EPE from one EPE component because another EPE component cannot be reduced further. Since SEPE is difficult to reduce, overlay EPE is sacrificed to reduce the total EPE. The ways to reduce overlay EPE in manufacturing include mark optimization to minimize effect of odd Zernike aberrations, minimization of the effect of process mark deformation on the alignment measurement, and minimization of wafer deformation through scanner stage and projection optics correction.", "As the semiconductor industry strives to keep Moore\u2019s Law moving forward, companies are continually confronted with new and mounting challenges. The use of fin field-effect transistors (finFETs) and the recent introduction of gate-allaround (GAA) finFETs present questions of performance, scalability, and variation resilience that have yet to be fully resolved. The need for multi-patterning, which has been in place since the 22 nm node, is not going away, even with the introduction of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Complex fill requirements have emerged as a critical success factor in both manufacturability and performance in leading-edge nodes. These factors, among others, have created significant impacts across the electronic design automation (EDA) design-to-tapeout ecosystem, particularly in physical verification. In response, EDA suppliers constantly evaluate and experiment with the design information they receive from both design houses and foundries, and often establish collaborative projects, to assess the impact of changing technology, and to develop and implement new functionality and new tools that reduce or eliminate time and resource impacts while ensuring accuracy and full coverage. Replacing inefficient, less precise verification processes with smarter, more accurate, faster, and more efficient functionality helps maintain, and even grow, both the bottom line and product quality in the face of increasing technological complexity.", "Fueled by higher bandwidth wireless communication and ubiquitous AI, the demand for more affordable and power efficient transistors is accelerating at a time when Dennard scaling is undeniably crawling to a halt. Escalating wafer and design cost are commonly identified as the primary culprits bringing Moore's law to its knees. However, a third component: the cost of making the wrong technology choice early in the development cycle, is equally responsible for slowing the progress of the semiconductor industry. The enormous complexity of leading edge technology nodes has been achieved incrementally over time by limiting each technology node to mostly small evolutionary steps. Forcing too much innovation in one technology node would have catastrophically disrupted the continuous learning curve. As we approach the fundamental device-physics and material-science limits of dimensional scaling, we are forced to look at far more disruptive device and interconnect innovations to achieve meaningful power-performance-area-cost (PPAC) improvement. For example, the complexity versus benefit tradeoffs of innovative 3-dimensional device architectures with non-standard power-distribution networks are so hard to quantify that rigorous yet efficient prototyping becomes indispensable even prior to committing foundry R&D resources. In this paper we present our work on developing a purpose-built suite of tools to vastly accelerate the quantitative pre-screening and optimization of technology options to help the industry maintain its relentless pace of PPAC scaling. We share several examples that demonstrate how we tune a candidate technology definition with this tool-suite. We also describe the important common technologies in successful Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) flows including physical material and process modeling; electrical and circuit simulation; detailed design analysis and modification to reduce weak points; handling enormous datasets; silicon learning feedback loop and intuitive visualization.", "The stability of photolithography process tool is the fundamental to the fabrication of semiconductor devices. Several process control methods are employed to qualify and then monitor every single process layer at the photolithography stage. The CDSEM (Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope) measurements on metrology features and the optical inspection and DRSEM (Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscope) on device features for Process Window Qualification is part of the conventional process control. Here we employed a novel PSD (Process Stability Diagnosis) solution that provides detailed Bossung plot like analysis on device features using CDSEM or DRSEM images. This provides quick insight into the process behavior and also identifies the root cause for any deviation. In this paper we will discuss about monitoring the depth of focus and the best focus as well as diagnosis for lens parameters like astigmatism and spherical aberration. We describe the method of extracting relevant parameters from high resolution images and establishing an automatic monitor for these critical indicators.", "Via location and metal coverage have direct correlation. Optical proximity correction (OPC) always do selective sizing for metal to offer enough via enclosure, such as extending line end or doing external expansion for related metal edge. Hence via poor landing or metal bridging are both potential hotspots. For 14nm technology node and below, process related weak patterns are highly correlated with via locations and corresponding metal dimensions. A via optimization methodology has been put forward to enhance the robustness of design for physical design in fabless. With the aid of lithography check, the yield killers with high potential relativity with vias will be conducted root cause analysis. This paper describes the main solutions for fabless, including pin location blockage, via shift, via shape change, metal sizing change and so on within design rule check (DRC) constraints. The simulation experiment results prove the effective of these solutions due to related simulated yield killers being eliminated.", "Silicon weak pattern exploration becomes more and more attractive for yield improvement and design robustness as these proven silicon weak patterns or hotspots directly reveals process weakness and should be avoided to occur on the chip design. At the very beginning, only a few known hotspot patterns are available as seeds to initialize the weak pattern accumulation process. Machine learning technique can be utilized to expand the weak pattern database, the data volume is critical for machine learning. Fuzzy patterns are built and more potential hotspots locations are found and sent to YE team to confirm, thus more silicon proven data is available for machine learning model training, both good patterns and bad patterns are valuable for the training data set. The trained machine learning model is then used for new hotspots prediction. The outcome from the machine learning prediction need to be validated by silicon data in the first few iterations. When a reliable machine learning model is ready for hotspots detection, designers can run hotspot prediction at the design stage. There are some techniques in training the mode and will be discussed in details in the paper.", "High yield is always demanded in IC manufacturing, however, as process variations and random particles are part of the manufacturing process in nature, yield and circuit performance are inevitably impacted by these factors especially in advanced nodes. Even so, there\u2019s often some room to polish designs to be manufacturing friendly. The design for manufacturability (DFM) approach has been taken to optimize designs to minimize process variation impact on the yield and performance. One area gaining success toward yield improvement is VIA (Vertical Interconnect Access) design optimization. There are some technical approaches that designers may take: adding redundant VIA at possible spots without increasing the design area is a proven way to address random particle induced VIA void issues; increasing VIA enclosure area by shifting VIA to an optimum location effectively minimizes masks misalignment induced enclosure issues, and note that shifting VIA needs to consider some complex situations when clustered VIAs constrain each other. There are also other circumstances that need to be considered and handled depending on specific manufacturing process. All these contents will be presented in detail in the paper.", "As we move to more advanced nodes, the number of Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) steps in semiconductor processing is increasing rapidly. CMP is known to suffer from pattern dependent variation such as dishing, erosion, recess, etc., all of which can cause performance and yield issues. One such yield issue seen in back end of line (BEOL) Cu interconnect CMP processes is pooling. Pooling exists when there is uncleared bulk Cu and/or barrier residue remaining after final CMP step, leading to shorts between neighboring interconnect lines. To detect potential pooling locations on a given design, for a given CMP process, predictive CMP models are needed. Such models can also aid in CMP process and chip design optimizations. In this paper we discuss how a pattern dependent CMP effect that we call the \u201clocal neighborhood effect\u201d causes large recesses that can lead to pooling in Cu interconnect CMP processes. We also discuss modeling this effect as part of an advanced predictive CMP modeling system and show how the resulting modeling system accurately predicts Cu pooling on several 14 nm designs.", "Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) is a key process in integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing. Successful fabrication of semiconductor devices is highly dependent on the final planarity of the processed layers. Post-CMP topography variation may cause degradation of the circuit performance. Moreover, the depth-of-focus (DOF) requirement is critical for lithography of subsequent layers. As such, planarity requirements are critical for maintaining IC manufacturing technology scaling trends, and supporting device innovation. To mitigate post-CMP planarity issues, dummy fill insertion has become a commonly-used technique. Many factors impact dummy fill insertion results, including fill shapes, sizes, and the spacing between both fill shapes and the drawn layout patterns. The goal of the CMP engineer is to optimize design planarity, but the variety of fill options means just verifying the design rules for fill is a challenging task. This data collection currently requires a long development cycle, consuming a great deal of time and resources. In this paper, we show how CMP modeling can help resolve these issues by applying CMP modeling and simulations to drive Calibre YieldEnhancer SmartFill parameters that have been optimized for dummy fill. Additional capabilities in the SmartFill functionality automate CMP hotspot fixing steps. Using CMP simulations, engineers can get feedback about post-CMP planarity for given fill options in a much shorter time. Not only does this move dummy fill optimization experiments from a real lab into a virtual lab of CMP modeling and simulation, but it also provides more time for these experiments, providing improved results.", "It\u2019s desirable to gain high yield and good performance for memory products. Designers have to do some advanced DFM checking on their designs and fix all the critical design issues to be correct by construction before manufacturing. One of the DFM checking items is the litho hotspot checking, LFD (Litho Friendly Design) is the tool adopted for that checking due to its user friendly interface for designers and being able to be integrated with other tools for the advanced checking flow development. One challenge to enable this checking as the signoff item is the long runtime due to the computing-intensive litho simulation. Multiple ways have been figured out to reduce the runtime, for instance, hierarchical checking flow similar to hierarchical design flow under the assumption that many design blocks are reused on the top level; simulation only on the area selected by weak pattern candidates stored in a pattern matching library; simulation only on the unique pattern area by firstly decomposing the layout. All these approaches always tradeoff between runtime and simulation accuracy and come to use with different expectations as the process gradually matures. This paper introduces another technique to reduce the simulation time. This technique is essentially a pattern matching extended application and will be introduced in detail in the paper.", "In the advanced nodes, abutted corners often referred to as kissing corners, are not physically printable using single layer photolithography techniques. In order to mitigate any downstream impact, the authors propose specific kissing corner handling methodologies in Mask Data Prep (MDP). In the layout, beveling is a method that can add or subtract shapes to either allow a resist feature to remain or space to resolve. Unlike functional active areas, Fill kissing corners can be proactively avoided by a correct-by-construction approach. Both these methodologies yield faster processing while improving the results without necessitating any design rule change.", "As the IC manufacturing enter sub 20nm tech nodes, DFM become more and more important to make sure more stable yield and lower cost. However, by introducing newly designed hardware (1980i etc) process chemical (NTD) and Control Algorithm (Focus APC) into the mature tech nodes such as 14nm/12nm, more process window and less process variations are expected for latecomer wafer fabs (Tier-2/3 companies) who just started the competition with Tier-1 companies. With improved weapons, latecomer companies are able to review their DFM strategy one more time to see whether the benefit from hardware/process/control algorithm improvement can be shared with designers In this paper, we use OPC simulation tools from different EDA suppliers to see the feasibility of transferring the benefits of hardware/process/control algorithm improvement to more relaxed design limitation through source mask optimization (SMO): 1) Better hardware: scanner (better focus/exposure variation), CMP (intrafield topo), Mask CD variation (relaxed MEEF spec), etc.; 2) New process: from positive tone development to negative tone development; 3) Better control schemes: holistic focus feedback, feedback/forward overlay control, high order CD uniformity improvement; Simulations show all those gains in hardware and process can be transferred into more relaxed design such as sub design rule structure process window include forbidden pitches (1D) and smaller E2E gaps (2D weak points).", "In urgent post tape-out, runtime is a big challenging for backend layers\u2019 OPC (Optical Proximity Correction). Sometimes there is no extra time for OPC to clean all the ORC (Optical Rule Check) hotspots with recipe tuning. So the repair flow is the good choice, the repair flow is costly final step, especially for Metal layer\u2019s. In some challenging case, there will be thousands or millions hotspots which can\u2019t pass various ORC criteria need to be into repair flow, thus not only makes our system overloading and the runtime is unacceptable. There are many applications for Machine Learning (ML) in IC field, such as ML-OPC, ML-Hotspot detection and ML-SRAF etc. And Calibre ML-OPC has powerful functionality which fits the requirement of repair flow very well. In this paper, we will introduce how to use Calibre ML-OPC to reduce the most of the defects to speed up the repair process and demonstrate the benefit comparing to the traditional repair flow.", "Standard cells are the most critical and reusable elements to build up the whole chip, therefore foundry has to fully qualify the standard cell libraries to ensure their high quality when releasing to the customers for the chip design. To prevent pattern dependent lithographic difficulty in manufacturing is one target of standard cell qualification and becomes mandatory especially in advanced nodes due to tighter design rules and smaller design size. To identify a lithographic problematic standard cell, we have to take its surroundings within the optical diameter range into consideration because lithographic effects are intrinsically context-dependent. One critical step is to imitate standard cells placements in real designs and consider some important factors like VIA location as it impacts the mask shape directly. When the placement is completed, lithographic simulation is performed by LFD (Litho Friendly Design) to highlight risky locations. Every standard cell has to occur enough number of times to make sure the statistics of possibility of being a problem is reliable. The final statistics will instruct engineers on how to handle the problematic standard cells, either standard cell layouts have to be optimized or building a pattern database to prevent the abutments of particular standard cell combinations.", "As feature resolution and process variations continue to shrink for new nodes of both DUV and EUV lithography, the density and number of devices on advanced semiconductor masks continue to increase rapidly. These advances cause significantly increased pressure on the accuracy and efficiency of OPC and assist feature (AF) optimization methods for each subsequent process technology. To meet manufacturing yield requirements, significant wafer retargeting from the original design target is often performed before OPC to account for both lithographic limitations and etch effects. As retargeting becomes more complex and important, rule-table based approaches become ineffective. Alternatively, modelbased optimization approaches using advanced solvers, e.g., inverse lithography technology (ILT), have demonstrated process window improvement over rule-based approaches. However, model-based target optimization is computationally expensive which typically limits its use to smaller areas like hotspot repairs. In this paper, we present results of a method that uses machine-learning (ML) to predict optimal retargeting for line-space layers. In this method, we run ILT co-optimization of the wafer target and process window to generate the training data used to train a machine learning model to predict the optimum wafer target. We explore methods to avoid ML model overfitting and show the ML infrastructure used to integrate ML solution into a manufacturable OPC flow. Both lithographic quality and runtime performance are evaluated for an ML enabled retargeting flow, an ILT flow and a simple rule table flow at advanced node test cases.", "As VLSI device feature sizes are getting smaller and smaller, lithography hotspot detection and elimination have become more important to avoid yield loss. Although various machine learning based methods have been proposed, it is not easy to find appropriate parameters to achieve high accuracy. This paper proposes a feature selection method by using the probability distributions of layout features. Our method enables automatic feature optimization and classifier construction. It can be adaptive to different layout patterns with various features. In order to evaluate hotspot detection methods in the situation close to actual problem, dataset based on ICCAD2019 dataset is used for evaluation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method and limitations.", "As we are stepping towards sub-10 nm nodes, process window monitoring for systematic defects is becoming more and more critical. In traditional process window excursion and control (PWEC) methods often optical defect inspection is done on a focus and dose modulated wafer first. Once the different systematic defects are detected in a particular focus/energy die, we flag the repeating defect locations as potential hotspots and rank them based on how early/late they fail in a focus/energy modulated columns. So, during this first pass we get a rough idea of which locations are failing. However, due to limited resolution of optical tools, the true process window can only be gathered during a second pass with an ebeam tool. The key idea to define a true process window demands a detailed analysis of CD and other underlying features. We have proposed a new method of analyzing the process window with an unsupervised machine learning approach. Our proposed algorithm will extract the underlying key features and encode these to latent feature vectors or latent vector space instead of the conventional CD, given a dataset of thousands of CD-SEM images, and then rank the images based on a similarity index and then to automatically determine the process window. This work addresses the following problems (1) with a defect inspection tool this task seems tedious and time consuming and often require human intervention to analyze a large number of features, (2) a CD-SEM based process window analysis might not always match with a defect inspectionbased process window. Our generalized variational auto-encoder based approach does this automatically. Also, we have analyzed and validated our result against conventional approach.", "Maximizing yield in a modern semiconductor fab requires proper optimization of the design (layout), process technology, and fab process tool recipes. For the past decade the prevalence of systematic defects tied to design or design-process interactions have predominated over random defect sources. Previously Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET), Design For Manufacturability (DFM), and Design-Technology Co-optimization (DTCO) techniques were the successful response to eliminating systematic yield limiting patterns. Machine learning, with its ability to find trends and make predictions based on large volumes of data, provides a unique path towards further reduction in systematic defect levels. This talk will present methods based on the use of design and process info with machine learning and computational lithography methods to identify and eliminate yield limiting patterns in the design, improve the accuracy of mask generation with etch and resist modeling and OPC, and improve the productivity and accuracy of fab defect detection and diagnostics. This paper will present methods to improve EPE control and reduce systematic hotspots through both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Specifically we will focus on 3 areas: - identifying and yield limiting patterns in the design phase. - improving the accuracy (EPE control) of mask generation with machine learning assisted etch and resist modeling and OPC. - improving the productivity and accuracy of fab defect detection and diagnostics with machine learning.", "Predictive modeling of the pitch-walk variance from multistep coupled processes, such as SAQP using experimental metrology observables, has the potential to give both deep understanding and a control mechanism for pitch-walk variance. In this study, with the Bayesian dropout approximation, a methodology using Bayesian inference via use of stochastic neural networks was employed to both model and predict the SAQP pitch-walk variance distribution. Bayesian neural networks were implemented as variational ensembles of networks with hidden layers, where the neural net training uses conventional dropout, while the forward solves employ a dropout Bayesian vector methodology previously developed by Gal and Ghahramani.1, 2 An important distinction here is that the forward propagations effectively sample the network to make a prediction, resulting in a distribution of outputs achieving the best model, not just a single expectation value. A complete dataset of fin module OCD metrology measurements per chip at top mandrel, bottom mandrel, and final fin reveal were used. Since the measured dataset was limited to small number chip locations, data augmentation with the highly efficient method of the volume of simplex was used to generate 30K samples. The synthetic data and the experimental data were used for neural network calibration and validation, respectively.", "We present a model-based experimental design methodology for accelerating 3D etch optimization with demonstration on 3D NAND structures. The design and optimization of etch recipes for such 3D structures face significant challenges requiring costly and time-consuming experiments in order to achieve the required tolerances. 3D NAND memory devices additionally require accurate nanofabrication of high aspect ratio trenches and isolation slits, which are challenging to manufacture reliably within specifications. Our model efficiently captures the relevant physical and chemical processes, which allows them to be calibrated using a limited number of experimental samples and can reproduce realistic 3D etch of multilayer materials, including bowing, necking, and tapering. Since our GPU-powered simulations run in a matter of minutes, the relevant process parameter space can be explored extensively in a short amount of time. The calibrated physics-based model can be used to train adaptive machine-learning-based heuristics which enable near-instant queries, for example for data visualization and analytics. With this approach, we show a rapid methodology for locating optimal windows in the process parameter space for etching 3D structures. Optimality metrics under consideration include both conformances to specified tolerances as well as robustness against process parameter variations. These techniques can reduce cost and time to market for complex multi-layer three-dimensional device designs and improve semiconductor device yields.", "Due to ever decreasing device dimensions and the introduction of 3D device architectures, it is challenging to operate within a narrow processing window using conventional plasma etching. One method to address the demands of the next-generation of devices is atomic layer etching (ALE) which provides high fidelity, selectivity, and directionality, and layer-by-layer removal. Plasma-assisted ALE has been extensively studied for a variety of materials, including Al2O3, HfO2, Si, and Si based dielectrics. Plasma-assisted ALE of SiO2 or SiNx typically uses two sequential steps in a cyclic fashion: CFx deposition from a C4F8/Ar plasma followed by an Ar plasma activation step. However, the surface chemistry during plasma ALE is not well understood. In this study, we used in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FTIR) spectroscopy and in situ four-wavelength ellipsometry during ALE to monitor the surface reactions, film composition, as well as the net film thickness. Similar to area-selective atomic layer deposition, we show that surface functionalization prior to ALE can be used to alter the etch per cycle. Using this methodology, we will discuss how selective functionalization of SiO2 or SiNx can be used to alter the selectivity during plasma-assisted ALE. Acknowledgement: We would like to acknowledge our collaborators at Lam Research for funding this work.", "The etching of silicon nitride spacers is one of the most challenging steps of transistor fabrication. It requires anisotropy to preserve the sidewalls and a high etch selectivity over the underlying substrate to achieve a high surface quality. Recently, an interesting approach using a two step-process was proposed for the etching of silicon nitride spacers with high anisotropy and minimal induced damage [1]. The first step uses an H2 implantation to selectively modify the horizontal SiN surfaces over the vertical ones, while the second step selectively removes the modified layer either via HF exposure or via a remote plasma (RP). This paper explores a new route to implement those two steps in a cycling process achieved in the same plasma reactor chamber. The reactor has the capability to produce both a capacitive plasma discharge (CCP) for the implantation step and a remote discharge for the removal step. This study demonstrates that the remote plasma process, whose etching mechanisms are driven by reactive neutrals, is highly sensitive to the material surface state and consequently an incubation time exists before the etching starts when exposed to neutrals. The modifications induced by the first implantation step shortens the incubation time offering a process window with infinite etch selectivity between horizontal implanted and vertical non-implanted surfaces. Based on this understanding a two-step cycling process was developed and applied successfully to the etching of Si3N4 spacer patterns for imager applications.", "Stochastic defects in the photoresist profile are one of the main yield limiters in EUV lithography patterning. These stochastic defects can be, for example, local resist loss, resist profile footing, or resist scumming. A subset of these defects is transferred through the hardmask open (HMO) patterning, leading ultimately to electrical opens and shorts. We use on-wafer data and process recipes to inform a physical etch model of the HMO process. This model is tested and confirmed by comparison to additional on-silicon data. The established model provides a visualization of the defect transfer through individual process steps and highlights critical patterning steps that may limit electrical yield. For example, a change in in-situ deposition time is observed to be more sensitive than oxide open or planarization film open times both in the model and on-wafer. This provides us the insight to focus tuning deposition step times to reduce defectivity and improve process performance. Furthermore, this model provides insight into the type of defects which are eliminated during specific patterning steps, and the type of defects which are persistent and ultimately lead to electrical opens and shorts. To characterize these defects, we plant intentional defects with varying dimensions and study which ones stay through the entire HMO process and which ones are eliminated. This insight helps better understand the HMO process, which may lead in the future to further process improvements.", "Performance demands for many devices has driven feature dimensions to reduce to sub nm scale. Whilst new, and complex combinations of materials have increased the importance of interface effects at the atomic scale. Many of the macro-market dynamics such as Internet of Everything, increased volume in data traffic and energy efficiency require III-V based devices eg GaN, SiC. The combination of new materials and dimensions means that new etch solutions are required to achieve the accuracy and low damage needed for optimized device results. Low damage etching of AlGaN, GaN and SiN layers were studied using the PlasmaPro100 Cobra300 system from Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology, configured with ICP-RIE, RIE and ALE plasma etching modes. These techniques were used to etch shallow depths of between 5 and 100 nm in both SiN, AlGaN and GaN substrates and the resultant etched surface layer quality was measured using Atomic Force Microscopsy (AFM). ALE of SiN and GaN showed etch rates of 2.5 nm/min and 2 nm/min respectively. Using a conventional ICP-RIE process a GaN etch rate of 50 nm/min with a selectivity to AlGaN of 25:1 was achieved.", "Emerging memory technologies such as Resistive Memory (RRAM) have gained a lot of attention to meet the requirements of a potential analog computing element, due to its non-volatile characteristics, scalability and energy efficiency. An RRAM device typically consists of a resistive switching layer (e.g. HfO2) sandwiched between two metal electrodes. Since oxygen vacancies are critical to the functioning of the device, it is desirable to achieve residue free etching using oxygen-less plasmas, and preferably minimize exposure to ambient environment. In this work, we discuss the RRAM patterning challenges and their impact on the device characteristics including the switching/forming voltage.", "FinFETs have demonstrated significant performance improvement compared to planar devices, because of its superior short channel control and higher driving capability at a much smaller footprint. It has become the mainstream technology in CMOS industry since N20 node onward. Contact Poly Pitch (CPP) scaling used to be the main driving force in extending Moore\u2019s law. However, severe limitations are foreseen from N3 node in terms of electrical performance, process requirements and manufacturing complexity. At N3 node, both fin and gate pitches are expected to reach their ultimate values, respectively 21 nm and 42 nm. Therefore, complex plasma etching processes using advanced plasma pulsing modes or atomic layer etching (ALE) are deployed to achieve high aspect ratio patterning capability with a detrimental effect on both process control and throughput. As an alternative, device architecture innovation will become the main scaling driving force for N3 node and beyond. 2D scaling like horizontal Gate-All-Around (GAA) devices, such as nanosheet (NS) and forksheet (FS) have demonstrated the potential for further device performance improvement [1,2]. The major NS patterning challenges are the SiGe lateral etch in the Si/SiGe superlattice stack and severe depth micro-loading due to the etch rate difference of SiGe and Si. In addition, 3D hybrid device architectures like Complementary FET (CFET) and Surrounding-Gate-Transistors (SGT) are proposed as revolutionary innovations to scale the devices in the vertical direction. For CFET devices, the N/P separation is moved to the vertical direction by stacking nMOS on top of pMOS or vice versa to achieve aggressive device scaling. This requires extremely high aspect ratio fin and gate patterning compared to horizontal-GAA NS devices. For SGT device, the channel is switched to the vertical direction, which can decouple the Gate length (Lg) from CPP scaling and eliminate the diffusion break to deeply scale the cell size. High aspect ratio vertical nanowire (NW) and direct metal gate etching with tight pitch are the new FEOL patterning challenges for the fabrication of SGT vertical devices.", "The parallelism of optics and the miniaturization of optical components using nanophotonic structures, such as metasurfaces, present a compelling alternative to electronic implementations of convolutional neural networks. The lack of a low-power optical nonlinearity, however, requires slow and energy-inefficient conversions between the electronic and optical domains. Here, we design an architecture that utilizes a single electrical to optical conversion by designing a free-space optical frontend unit that implements the linear operations of the first layer with the subsequent layers realized electronically. Speed and power analysis of the architecture indicates that the hybrid photonic\u2013electronic architecture outperforms a fully electronic architecture for large image sizes and kernels. We also explore the ways the nonlinearity can be implemented in optical domain, and analyze the performance of a degenerate cavity for nonlinear image processing.", "R&D on transistor fabrication and scaling for current and future technology nodes involves various 3D-device architectures like the established finFET (fin \u201cField Effect Transistor\u201d), and newer architectures like GAA (Gate All Around) which may include VFET (vertical FET), CFET (complimentary FET), etc. These new architectures are being investigated as potential solutions to enable further CMOS area and performance scaling and continue Moore\u2019s law. Typically node to node area scaling is achieved through pitch reduction of critical layers such as contacted poly pitch (CPP) and fin pitch in FEOL, and Mx pitch in the BEOL. For such advanced nodes, at the device level, the CPP reduction translates to a stronger drive for shorter gate length (Lg) and so, for improved electrostatics control (Ion, Ioff, Tinv, etc.). Integration schemes for such advanced 3D architectures must deliver excellent process control and uniformity, especially for critical device features such as gate length and channel dimensions, and demand self-aligned multi-patterning schemes to address edge-placement accuracy, overlay, multiple mask sets, etc. A frequently encountered etch step in such integration schemes is the trimming of Si features made of mono, polycrystalline, or amorphous Si. Some key applications are listed here: fin trimming for (1) lateral transport finFET and for (2) vertical transport VFET, (3) final gate trim for lateral transport finFET, GAA/CFET, etc. (4) amorphous gate mandrel trim for lateral transport FETs (multi-patterning).", "Plasma etch residue formation and its removal from silicon nitride (SiN) films deposited at 200\u00baC, 480\u00baC and 700\u00baC is explored. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showed that SiN contains more nitrogen (N) and less oxygen (O) with increasing deposition temperature. SiN films were etched in an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) reactor in a halogen/hydrofluorocarbon (H:HFC) gas mixture; the carbon (C) containing species in the resulting residue films were studied as a function of the H:HFC ratio in the plasma. Post-plasma etch cleaning methods of the SiN surface were compared, these included: wet treatment with diluted hydrofluoric acid (dHF), sputtering with argon (Ar) plasma, and combined dHF and Ar plasma. After etch, Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) and XPS data showed formation of fluorocarbon (FC) films on SiN. FC film thickness after etch was estimated from XPS to reach up to 2 nm. Ultimately the SiN etch rate was shown to drop with increasing deposited C thickness while the lower nitrogen content in the SiN film (i.e. 200\u00baC) led to higher etch rate, which is in good agreement with literature. Ar plasma sputter turned out to be the most effective way of cleaning C residues: C surface content after Ar sputter was reduced to or below the reference data (unetched sample). In terms of wet treatment, an optimized chemistry was identified (AltChem) and post-RIE cleaning was more efficient than dHF in reducing C surface concentrations.", "As the logic industry marches toward the 5nm technology node, multiple patterning schemes are intensively used to achieve sub-193nm lithography resolution for line and space definition. Several sources are reporting the need to use Self Aligned Dual Patterning (SADP) with EUV lithography. Implementing those spacer-based pitch splitting techniques is not trivial; they require major design changes and restrictions along with the additional patterning steps. They also increase manufacturing cost and process complexity. A faster, cost-effective option would be advantageous. Spin-on-carbon (SOC) is a promising candidate for first mandrel formation compared to alternatives such as Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) materials due to its lower cost and high-throughput. There are several benefits of using SOC as a first mandrel for SADP such as minimal recess in the floor during mandrel formation and high selectivity during the spacer etch and mandrel pull process. However, during the deposition of the spacer material, usually oxide or nitride, the carbon mandrel can be eroded, and the shape can be distorted, affecting the shape of the spacer in the next step. To enable the use of SOC for first mandrel, mandrel treatment and spacer shape optimization need to be addressed. In this paper, we will investigate a method to protect and preserve the shape of the carbon mandrel by using a direct current superposition (DCS) on a capacitively-coupled plasma (CCP) chamber. Then, we will review spacer etch development to reach the required final shape. Finally, we will perform a step-by-step roughness analysis and consider additional smoothing options.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is the technology for high volume manufacturing (HVM) of semiconductor ICs for photoresist patterns smaller than 75nm pitch\u00b9. A persistent challenge of the EUV scanner is to supply a high contrast image with enough photons to the photoresist (PR) to meet HVM productivity targets with acceptable dimensional and defectivity control. Local stochastic variability in dimension and placement dominates the total dimension control budget and reducing that variability by increasing the exposure dose comes at the cost of scanner throughput. Our objective is to deliver holistic patterning solutions by co-optimization of patterning film stack, lithography, and subsequent etch processes to transfer the patterns to the target layer with CD and placement control of order 1nm or less! This synergistic approach enables circuit fabrication customers to manage the tradeoff between stochastic defects and productivity in EUV patterning.", "The integration of new materials in the next generation of optoelectronic devices leads to several challenges. For instance, the etching of indium tin oxide (ITO, In2O3:Sn) faces the issue of the low volatility of In- and Sn-based etch products at room temperature. This is challenging for the etching process itself, but even more problematic when the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) reactor must be cleaned after etching: since the reactor walls are bombarded by low energy ions only, the removal of In- and Sn-based products redeposited on the walls can be very long and laborious. Therefore, we have investigated several plasma chemistries to find the most efficient reactor cleaning process suitable for ITO plasma etching. The results show that after ITO plasma etching the walls are indeed contaminated by indium. At the low temperature at which the reactor walls are regulated, BCl3/Cl2 cleaning plasma is ineffective to remove this deposit while HBr and CH4/Cl2 chemistries provide promising results.", "We present a machine learning-based metrology pipeline for electron microscope imagery in the semiconductor industry. The pipeline is targeted to reduce the time spent by Process Engineers during research and development, by automating measurements of features according to their instructions in the form of a \u201cmeasurement recipe\u201d. Specifically, we present the principles and functionality of tools to measure Fin and 3D Memory structures based on edge finding algorithms, including through direct modelling of the SEM acquisition process to better capture blurred-appearing features.", "As the critical dimensions (CDs) of etch profiles continue to decrease, precise control of plasma etch processing becomes increasingly important. Achieving this control requires optimizing etch recipes, which is time consuming and expensive as an extensive amount of experiments must be performed. Here we present a method for the prediction of process windows to achieve target CDs for high aspect ratio trenches using model-based experimental design. A reduced-order model of the physics and chemistry of the etch is used to identify the best experiments to perform to calibrate the model. The model is then used to efficiently explore the process parameter space to identify the largest ranges of process parameters that achieve desired ranges of CDs. The methodology is practically demonstrated on a three-step trench etch through three layers of material consisting of spin-on-glass, spin-on-carbon and silicon. It is found that this physics-model based method requires less than half as many experiments to identify the optimal etch recipe than full-factorial design of experiments.", "The etch induced on-product overlay performance across wafer has received quite some attention recently. Global wafer overlay penalties have been observed by realizing that the etch direction is not always perpendicular to the wafer surface and may vary slightly as a function of the wafer radius due to the geometry and plasma parameter settings of the etch tool. In particular close to the wafer edge, for radii in between 130-mm and 150-mm, the etch direction may change even more strongly and is not constant over time. This is due to a consumable part inside the etch tool, the so-called focus ring. Control solutions based on optical overlay metrology have been developed and have found their way into tunable focus rings. The general concept is to keep the etch direction perpendicular to the wafer surface throughout the life-time of the focus ring. The general belief is that these global etch induced overlay penalties can be mitigated by applying these newly developed hardware control solutions. In this experimental work, we go one level deeper and consider the more local etch induced overlay penalties. This time etch effects on length scales on the order of exposure field and/or die level are addressed. The intra-field etch induced overlay penalties are characterized by considering the overlay measurement after resist development (ADI) and after etch (AEI). Surprisingly, the observed penalties are on the order of ~1-nm within each individual exposure field despite the fact that away from the wafer edge the etch direction is considered to be close to perpendicular to the wafer surface. In this experimental work, etch tool parameters like low frequency (LF) power and pressure have been varied to reveal the nature of these die-level overlay penalties. Based on the experimental results, we present a hypothesis of the underlying mechanism that explains the etch induced intra-field overlay penalties and provide solution directions to mitigate these kinds of overlay penalties."], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
