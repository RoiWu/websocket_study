These instances eventually combine into the resist deprotection function, resulting, by virtue of the Central Limit Theorem, in Gaussian Random Field deprotection models. We discuss and demonstrate the approaches to calibration of such models, based on experimentally measured edges of lithographic features, their LER, LWR and PSD. We also present, discuss and analyze the phenomenon of \u201cspatial ergodicity\u201d and its effect on proper sampling of edge measurements for stochastic model calibration.", "Local CD uniformity (LCDU) is being considered as one of key parameter indicators of patterning quality control due to continuous pattern shrinkage and maintaining wafer quality in lithography process. In optical DUV lithography, LCDU has various contributors and they are systematic mask/OPC items, SEM metrology reproducibility, and stochastic effects. In stochastic term, it includes photoresist and speckle contrast. In general, photoresist is considered as the dominant factor in LCDU control, but speckle contrast is drawing attention due to importance of controlling LCDU in new device. Speckle is a light interference effect which causes the non-uniform dose delivery to mask and wafer, and we experimentally confirmed the effect of speckle contrast in several layers. In this paper, we will propose estimated the speckle budget of total LCDU in the target layers through the experiment.", "Maskless exposure makes possible of individual chip design customization and large area chip fabrication that are impossible with mask exposure. We are developing DUV optical maskless exposure tool named as Digital Scanner (DS) that uses a spatial light modulator as a pattern generator and a DUV solid-state laser as a light source (193 or 248 nm). We will report technology development progress of DS including the latest experimental data. Sub-pixel patterning capability by DS will be presented. Finally, we will discuss on the DS production tool with 248 nm exposure wavelength that are being prepared to release in mid-2020s.", "Advancing technology nodes in CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) continues to drive a shrinking process to acquire higher resolution and low power consumption as well as more cost-effective production. With the sensor pixel size scaling down, a thicker photoresist (with aspect ratios greater than 10:1) is introduced to block high-energy implants with extremely localized implant profiles. Then double exposures/double focus (DE/DF) is applied to make sure the resist profile and process window is comparable or better. However, this process is a big challenge at high volume manufacturing (HVM) phase because of throughput loss. To recover it due to DE/DF, we invented SE MFI which uses two wavelengths (\u201ccolors\u201d) generated by the KrF excimer laser to solve the problem. Due to the chromatic aberrations in the lens, the focal plane shift of different wavelength produces nearly the same result as DE/DF. However, the use of two-wavelengths brings some challenges. The first is the loss of image contrast and the second is the impact of chromatic aberrations across the slit which results in image shift and image asymmetry. In this work, we demonstrated that the use of ASML\u2019s Tachyon KrF MFI source mask optimization (SMO) that can match the MFI SE process to DE/DF process of record (POR). We first used Tachyon Focus-Exposure Modeling plus (FEM+) to calibrate a DE resist model by using DE POR wafer data. Then we converted the DE model to a SE MFI model. At the end, we use the Tachyon MFI-SMO to optimize the SE MFI to match the DE/DF and MFI sidewall profiles through process window conditions at the center slit. We achieved making the MFI and DE/DF sidewall difference significantly smaller than other noises which can be measured on wafer at the center slit. We evaluated the chromatic aberration impact on through slit sidewall profiles also meet the specification. The through slit matching between MFI and DE/DF was further improved by through-slit mask optimization. This is done by inserting asymmetry sub resolution assist features (SRAFs). Tachyon Optical Proximity Correction plus (OPC+) can support full chip mask corrections for full-chip HVM. The above MFI technology including Tachyon optimization capability will be verified by wafer exposure via comparison between MFI and DE wafer results.", "The road towards the next technology leap in EUV lithography is set. ASML and ZEISS have designed and started manufacturing the next generation EUV exposure tool. With a wafer side NA of 0.55, the High NA scanner system will support the further pattern node scaling roadmap by improving image contrast and therewith reduce LCDU and defect print rate on product wafer. As for all major steps in the lithography evolution, the whole infrastructure will develop further in order to support this next quantum leap in EUV technology, with the EUV photomask technologies and metrology tools representing an essential piece of the mosaic. The AIMS\u00ae EUV system represents a unique piece of the EUV mask infrastructure for the qualification of the mask printing performance in the aerial image. The AIMS\u00ae aerial image is by design targeted to match the scanner aerial image, as the tool is engineered to emulate all imaging relevant scanner properties, e.g., mask side NA, through slit chief-ray characteristics, aberration level, illumination schemes. For the emulation of the High NA scanner, ZEISS developed and started manufacturing an upgrade for the current existing 0.33NA AIMS\u00ae EUV platform. The same AIMS\u00ae EUV system is therefore capable of imaging 0.33NA isomorphic as well as 0.55NA anamorphic masks, providing the best-in-class performance for both imaging technologies and optimal match to scanner imaging. In this paper the first imaging results of the AIMS\u00ae EUV High NA tool are shown together with quantitative analysis of 0.55NA anamorphic imaging properties. The challenges of providing two intrinsically diverse emulation types (0.33NA isomorphic and 0.55 anamorphic) in one single platform are described together with the solutions which were implemented and tested.", "EUV lithography has been adopted worldwide for High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM) of sub-10nm node semiconductors. To support HVM, EUV pellicles were introduced by ASML in 2016, and more recently, pellicles made from novel materials were developed to offer higher transmission and support higher source powers. In this paper, we will give an overview of current EUV pellicles. Also, we will report on our continuing research to optimize EUV pellicles to transmissions of above 90%, and supporting EUV source powers of above 400W. Key performance indicators of such novel pellicles will be presented, showing the promise of these materials to support upcoming lithography nodes.", "Background: In EUV lithography, the absorber material determines the amplitude and phase of the diffracted orders, which define best focus (BF) and depth of focus (DOF). Control of BF and DOF is needed for mid and high numerical aperture (NA) systems. Aim: Generate recommendations for EUV absorber classes and explain the best focus shifts that occur for bright and dark field mask imaging. Approach: We anchor simulations with experiments using a TaBN absorber, then investigate the BF and DOF for various absorbers using simulation. We use a simple analytical model to show that the analytically predicted diffraction orders behave similarly in magnitude and phase to EMF simulations. Results: We find good prediction for BF experiments and simulations using a very simple resist model, and fair prediction in DOF. We explain the BF shift depending on simple absorber parameters using an analytical model. The exact BF shift needs to be calculated using EMF simulations. Conclusions: Best focus shifts are more pronounced for dark than clear field masks, and more so in attPSM materials than in more binary absorbers. Magnitude and phase of the 0th order plays an important role in BF shifts. We are encouraged to explore low-reflection attPSM materials as mask absorbers.", "An alternate mask absorber is a generally applicable approach as a mitigation strategy for Mask 3-D effects (M3D) observed in EUV lithography. It is also an efficient solution in a production-worthy environment compared to multilayer modification or Source Mask Optimization (SMO) techniques. Absorbers with a high EUV extinction coefficient k allow for lower Best Focus Variation (BFV) through pitch and reduced Telecentricity Errors (TCE). This study evaluates Ta-Co alloys as potential high-k mask absorbers. It includes an experimental study of film morphology, surface composition, and stability of Ta-Co alloys as well as a theoretical investigation of the imaging performance. The optical constants were determined from EUV angle-dependent reflectivity measurements for three selected compositions, viz. TaCo, Ta2Co, and TaCo3. The Ta-Co alloys exhibit a higher EUV extinction coefficient k compared to the currently used TaBN absorber. TaCo and Ta2Co demonstrated smooth surfaces, were stable in a hydrogen environment, and in mask cleaning solutions. These qualified compositions of Ta-Co alloys were selected for aerial image simulations and compared with a TaBN absorber. The optimized absorber thickness for Ta-Co alloy absorbers is based upon NILS enhancement, Threshold to Size (TtS) and balancing of diffraction order amplitudes. A 10 nm alternate line-space pattern with a pitch of 20 nm and 14 nm square contact holes with a pitch of 28 nm were considered for the simulation study using High NA 0.55 EUV lithography process settings. The through pitch imaging performance was evaluated using NILS, TCE and BFV as metrics. Ta-Co alloys allow for a reduction in M3D effects at smaller absorber thickness compared to a 60 nm TaBN absorber.", "Attenuated phase shifting masks (attPSM) for EUV lithography have shown the potential to improve the aerial image contrast through light and phase modulation and reduced mask three-dimensional (M3D) effects through thinner absorber. However, a robust optical design capable of generating almost identical performance for various patterns and feature sizes needs to be determined. The ability to identify and experimentally verify various mask absorber candidates is both challenging and expensive. Effective media approximation (EMA) identified material candidates have been shown to simplify the determination of material candidates through known optical constants of the constituent elements. An approach to engineer the desired optical properties and experimentally verify EMA modeling technique through multilayer thin films is presented. Mo \u2013 Ni multilayer films satisfying EMA requirement are deposited through RF magnetron sputtering. The verification of optical constants for multilayer films with 20%, 50% and 90% Ni volume fractions is performed at visible wavelengths through UV-Vis-NearIR variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE). EMA modeled multilayer absorber candidates are shown to have the flexibility in obtaining desired optical properties based on the layout-design requirements.", "In 2021 IRDS logic roadmap, required minimum contact/via pitch is 28 nm in 2025, which cannot be obtained by single exposure at 0.33 NA system using chemical amplified resist (CAR). To make the target possible, 0.55 NA system is the only way for single exposure. The relationship of resolution, roughness, and sensitivity has been known to be trade-off in CAR, and we tried optimizing them at 0.55 NA lithography simulation. For the optimization, not only resist material parameters, but also resist development parameters were adjusted. In addition, we conducted numerical simulation for line and space (L/S) pattern of metal oxide resist (MOR), which is expected as one of the breakthroughs for making narrower patterns. We set up a MOR NTD model and calibrated it by experimental data. The calibrated model is applied to the evaluation of the patterning performance including dose to size (DtS), roughness, and resist profile. Simulation results regarding a new wet development method for MOR to break through the RLS trade-off are introduced.", "The 7nm node is the first generation where EUV lithography has been employed to replace a few multi-patterning immersion layers in high-volume manufacturing. The insertion of EUV lithography in the 7nm node can simplify the production process, reduce the cycle time, improve performance, and enhance yield. However, in order to fully take advantage of these benefits, we need to overcome new challenges introduced by EUV technology. In this paper, we present how to integrate 193nm immersion and EUV lithography in production and optimize the critical steps in the process. Our 7nm product was initially taped out with full 193nm-immersion masks. When the immersion process stabilized with a decent yield, we taped out n EUV layers to replace 3n immersion layers in the product. To migrate our production from the immersion process to the EUV process smoothly, we started a few Lots with splits of the immersion and the EUV processes. Some wafers went through the full immersion lithography process and the rest of the wafers went through the hybrid lithography process with about n layers using EUV. At the end, we compared the Si data of the two processes. After a few iterations of tweaking, the EUV process can provide better performance and higher yield than the immersion process. In this report, we also provide examples of how the better CD control with the EUV mask can be achieved, the Edge Placement Error (EPE) can be reduced and the uniformity of the EUV back-end-of-line (BEOL) layer can be improved during EUV process development.", "Extending 0.33NA EUV single patterning to 28nm pitch becomes very challenging in terms of stochastic defectivity, which demands high contrast lithographic images. The low-n attenuated phase-shift mask (attPSM) can provide superior solutions for individual pitches by mitigating mask three-dimensional effects. The simulation and experiment results have shown substantial imaging improvements: higher depth of focus at similar normalized image log slope and smaller telecentricity error values than the best binary mask configuration. In this paper, the exploration of low-n attPSM patterning opportunity for pitch 28nm metal design is investigated. The lithographic performance of the low-n attPSM is compared to the standard binary Ta-based absorber mask. As well, the impact of mask tonality (bright-field vs. dark-field) on the pattern fidelity and process window is evaluated both by simulations and experiments.", "In order to improve logic via printing we propose staggered vias to effectively regularize randomly placed vias in a typical logic design. We accomplish this (i) by forcing via placement on a staggered sub-grid of the standard manhattan grid and (ii) by placing smaller fixed-size via Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAFs) on all remaining empty positions of the staggered grid. We devised a methodology to create such staggered via placement in a standard Place&Route (PNR) design flow and evaluated the concept on a 64-bit (64b) ARM core implementation through a PowerPerformance-Area (PPA) analysis. From a PNR run-time perspective and PPA analysis this looked a very viable implementation with little to no disadvantages compared to standard via placement. Finally, to experimentally test and compare staggered vias and against standard manhattan vias, we designed a via mask with both staggered and standard manhattan vias patterns and exposed them on an 0.33NA NXE3400 EUV lithography system. Analysis of experimental results on a 38nm via pitch show 40% smaller best-focus shift across the slit, and 20% smaller via-via CD variation for staggered vias compared to Manhattan vias with regular SMO.", "The use of a 4F2 cell configuration which enables higher densification is common in emerging memory devices. The pitch scaling and the robustness of these devices mainly rely on the patterning of the orthogonal array vertical pillar process. In this paper, we screen several lithography process approaches to optimize the 40nm pitch pillar patterning using single exposure EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography. The results show that with the optimized 40nm pitch process roughly 0.6nm 3-Sigma WCDU (wafer critical dimension uniformity) and 1.4nm 3-Sigma LCDU (local critical dimension uniformity) can be obtained post-litho for 21.1nm mean CD (critical dimension). Post-etch patterning with the best process shows 1.8nm 3-Sigma WCDU and 1.3nm 3-Sigma LCDU at 17.2nm mean CD. Smaller pitches have also been explored to identify the limits of the single EUV lithography process. Structures at 34nm pitch have shown high amount of pillar collapse. For 36nm pitch, on the other hand, a reasonable litho performance could be obtained with slightly boosted CD. The post-litho results show that with the optimized 36nm pitch process 0.4nm 3-Sigma WCDU and 1.4nm 3-Sigma LCDU can be obtained for 19.1nm mean CD.", "As overlay tolerances tighten node-over-node, the measurement and control of overlay has progressed from the low (spatial) frequent domain toward higher spatial frequencies. At present up to 3rd order in the (non-scanning) slit direction can be addressed on high end systems. With the introduction of an advanced distortion-manipulator on an ArFi immersion scanners a significant improvement in the spatial frequency of overlay control can be achieved. This actuator will now enable at least up to 9th order lens distortion manipulation and control in the (non-scanning) slit direction, with future extendibility to on-the-fly adjustments while scanning. The manipulator setup and distortion control is fully incorporated in the scanner software and allows for lens fingerprint optimization, better dynamic lens heating control, and scanner stability control to maintain overlay performance over time. Also an external scanner overlay optimization interface is made available that enables machine-to-machine matching within the immersion platform as well as for cross-matching to the EUV platform. Via this interface also high spatial-frequent process corrections can be send to the scanner. In this paper, we will show the capability of the scanner-integrated distortion manipulator on abovementioned aspects using on-scanner aberration metrology, and in-resist distortion and overlay metrology.", "With EUV lithography moved into volume production, it allows for a reduction of manufacturing complexity by minimizing the amount of pattern splits for critical layers. A key metric describing patterning capability , the total Edge Placement Error (EPE), scales with the technology nodes. As discussed in previous papers, overlay and OPC requirements are requested to scale faster than the EPE metric, in order to allow more room for stochastics in the total EPE budget. While the on product overlay (OPO) performance requirements continue to scale, these need to be met in a mix-andmatch mode of EUV and immersion DUV scanners. In this paper we will examine both EPE and OPO requirements for DUV and EUV scanners for advanced nodes. We will describe how multiple overlay metrology sources can be used to infer scanner corrections, how these systems are set up against a common reference and how we maintain this \u2018matched state\u2019 over time. As stated, these overlay improvements link back to the EPE budget and thus to its other components. We will describe how an enhanced view on EPE contributors will allow us to combine cross domain degrees of correction, during layer setup and control. Moreover, this EPE component breakdown will enable the ability to monitor this \u2018EPE state\u2019 by combining various sources of metrology; ultimately high spatial EPE variations may lead to a different scanner setup state. The need to describe the stability of all EPE constitutes warrants combining e-beam inspection systems with scanner, optical and SEM metrology to support diverse overlay, CD and control use models and process fingerprint mapping.", "We investigate the collisional radiative (CR) model of tin and heavier elements, to accurately predict their EUV emission spectrum to have a useful tool for the optimization of the source to obtain high output power and efficiency at 13.5 nm, as well as in 6 \u2013 7 nm region. Although, tin and heavy elements have a complex atomic structure and the emission occurs through a large number of fine structure transitions, their observed spectrum usually consists of few broad peaks, which are attributed to 4d-4f, 4p-4d, 4d-5p, and 4d-5f transitions. We show a simple representation of their wavelength from the investigation of theoretical and experimental spectrum.", "For finer linewidth patterning, 0.55 numerical aperture (NA) should be used instead of the existing 0.33 NA. In 0.55 NA extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), to alleviate the mask 3D effect and stochastic noise, which is stronger, it is necessary to develop an optimal phase shift mask (PSM) and multilayer mask for high NA. Mask structure is used PSM with composed of Ru-alloy/TaBO and multilayer composed of ruthenium (Ru)/silicon (Si), which is expected to be effective in mitigating mask 3D effect and improving imaging performance. The absorber reflectance was checked which is changed by variables such as pattern existence, target CD, and pitch ratio. In addition, by examining the relationship between the change in absorber reflectance and normalized image log slope (NILS), it was determined whether the mask structure for high NA was changed by the target pattern changes.", "Imec N3 logic design rules define a minimum via pitch of 36nm for a double patterning process. Enabling this pitch is crucial in terms of process time and number of masks involved. One method for extending 0.33 NA EUV is using advanced mask materials. Studies have shown that a low-n attenuated phase-shift mask (PSM) can improve EUV imaging performance, reduce mask 3D effects and improve optical contrast compared to the reference Ta-based mask. [1-3] In this paper, the impact of mask stack - Ta-based (binary or BIM) and low-n (PSM) - and mask tone - dark field (DF) vs. bright field (BF) - on a random logic Via layer will be evaluated. To pattern contact holes, we use negative tone development (NTD) metal-oxide resist process using the BF mask and positive tone development (PTD) chemically amplified resist process using the DF mask. Source mask optimization (SMO) was performed with and without subresolution assist feature (SRAF) as a resolution enhancement technology (RET). Optical proximity correction (OPC) was carried out on design clips using respective sources and mask rules at different mask tone. We show the optimum choice for this layer and present our recommendation based on current OPC simulations as well as some preliminary wafer data.", "Densification and reduction of lithographic features sizes keeping low defectivity is one of the biggest challenges in the patterning area. In order to extend 193 immersion capabilities and meet advanced applications needs, multi exposure image mode is a promising option for non-high volume manufacturing. It allows from a unique pattern with a fixed critical dimension (CD) and pitch, to obtain more dense patterns in a large surface without any process loop of standard flow, a huge benefit compared to litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE) approach. The study carried out explores this method with a specific design of pillars array printed using Negative Tone Development (NTD). The multi-image option relies on exposing multiple times the same initial pattern with a low image-to-image overlay. Based on intrinsic scanner performances, imageto-image placement error should be less than two nm. In this paper, many functionalities are explored to customize patterns from a single and unique mask design. One stake is to transfer (into silicon) a 2 mm * 2 mm pillar array design with a pitch divided by two, covering a wide surface on a 300 mm wafer and answering overlay and stitching requirements. Final results give well defined pillars which intra-wafer CD uniformity (3\u03c3) satisfies application process requests. By using a flexible multi-image mode, mask constraints (cost and quality) can be relaxed, i.e. with a larger pitch structure on the reticle than the targeted one, final feature can be achieved. This development can be extended to hybrid lithography such as NanoImprint Lithography (NIL) or specific applications such as optics.", "Discharge- and laser-produced plasma (DLPP) devices are being used as light sources for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) generation. A key challenge for both, DPP and LPP, is achieving sufficient brightness to support the throughput requirements of nanometrology tools. To simulate the environment of a hybrid DLPP device and optimize EUV output, we have developed an integrated HEIGHTS-DLPP computer simulation package. The package integrates simulation of two evolving plasmas (DPP & LPP) and includes modeling of a set of integrated self-consistent processes: external power source and plasma energy balance, plasma resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), plasma heat conduction, detailed radiation transport (RT), and laser absorption and refraction. We simulated and optimized DLPP devices using Xe gas as a target material. We synchronized the external circuit parameters, chamber gas parameters and laser beam temporal and spatial profiles to achieve maximum EUV output. The full 3D Monte Carlo scheme was integrated for detailed RT and EUV output calculations in Xe using more than 3600 spectral groups. The modeling results are in good agreement with Julich Forschungszentrum experimental data. Theoretical models, developed and integrated in HEIGHTS package, showed wide capabilities and flexibility. The models and package can be used for optimization of the experimental parameters and settings, investigation of DLPP devices with complex design, analyzing the impact of integrated spatial effects and working timeline arrangement on the final EUV output, and EUV source size, shape and angular distribution.", "We report the status of the CO2-Sn-LPP (Laser-produced-plasma) EUV light source development at Gigaphoton. It is the high power 13.5nm light source solution for the manufacturing of semiconductor pattern below 7nm. Our original technologies are a combination of a pulsed CO2 laser with Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser application and Sn debris mitigation with a magnetic field. Providing high EUV power with high operation availability is a requirement for the EUV light source system. With above technologies, we have demonstrated a collector mirror reflectivity degradation rate of less than -0.5%/Bp at an average power of 125W at IF during a week of operation. We also achieved an in-band power of 270W under dose-controlled operation and demonstrated a power scalability up to 365W. To achieve higher availability, we improved the two main factors that limit the operation availability, that are the lifetime of the droplet generator and of the collector mirror. We are developing a new long-lifetime droplet generator with an in-situ Sn fuel supply system. With this technology, we have demonstrated stable droplet generation continuously for more than 2000 hours. The mirror lifetime is determined by the reflectivity degradation of the multilayer coating, due to hydrogen blistering, oxidation, as well as sputtering, implantation, and deposition by Sn ions, Sn atoms, and Sn fragments. Since our magnetic mitigation scheme works effectively for lower energy ions, we developed advanced pre-pulse laser irradiation to suppress the generation of high-energy ions from the Sn plasma without loss of the high EUV Conversion Efficiency of ~6%. An in-situ shooting control system, which was developed for newly optimized laser conditions, remarkably improved the EUV energy and dose error 3\u03c3 by 50%. With this new shooting control technology, we demonstrated fragment-free EUV sample mirrors after a medium-term test at the EUV research source.", "The EQ-10 Electrodeless Z-pinchTM source uses Xenon plasma to produce 13.5 nm (\u00b11% BW) radiation. The source is used for metrology, mask inspection, and resist development. In this talk we will present modeling of the EQ-10 Z-pinch using the Trac-II radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) code. Specifically, we use RMHD calculations to explore development of the Electrodeless Z-pinch as a source of Blue-X (6.x nm) radiation. Critical to this study are the nonLTE effects on radiation physics and the equation of state. For this we rely on the FLYCHK collisional-radiative model to determine the radiative power loss. We also use the FLYCHK calculated emissivity to estimate the Blue-X power output. We revisit previous experimental attempts at obtaining Blue-X EUV radiation with neon gas. Having established a baseline of performance on our present Z-pinch system, we use RMHD calculations to scale to higher outputs of potential interest to the EUV community.", "According to the Power-Performance-Area requirements in advanced technology node, we already scaled down poly pitch (CPP) and metal pitch (MP) which considered as main factors to form standard cell (SDC) area. However, in recent technology nodes, the scaling of CPP and MP started to slow down, due to the physical limitation. To continue to meet the requirements, combined with Design-Technology co-optimization (DTCO), the height of standard cell would become the main factor here, which we could reduce it by reducing the number of tracks. In this paper, we would introduce 3DIC as one of the design options for 2nm node to keep scaling by reducing the cell height with its specific 3D structure and inserted booster. Also, we would introduce the coming challenges as importing 3D-IC to 2nm technology node.", "We explore in this study imaging performance of horizontally oriented logic metal layer designs computationally, focusing on metal patterns with a pitch of 20nm (P20) and a tip-to-tip (T2T) range of 8- 35nm using 0.55 NA EUV single exposure. Simulations are performed by the method of source-mask optimization (SMO) using the TachyonTM software. The key assessed imaging parameters include the (normalized) image log-slope (NILS/ILS), overlapping depth of focus (DOF), and best focus (BF) shift. Simulation results show that traditional TaBN masks offer a reasonable overall contrast and DOF of both dense lines and through-pitch line patterns. Low-n masks offer benefits in contrast and dose. Low-n masks also show improvement in BF shift range, but such benefits vary with the extinction coefficient k as well as the pitch range and pattern selections. Other resolution enhancement techniques such as subresolution assistant features (SRAF) and bright-field imaging associated with metal-oxide-resists (MOR) also provide help to improve patterning performance. Metal designs with thick power rails have an impact on the contrast of neighboring patterns. Inner SRAF OPC and narrow power rails can effectively eliminate this impact. Patternable T2T size is type-dependent. Our study finds a flat ILS when T2T size is \u226515nm (for P20 lines) and a quick ILS drop when T2T size is < 15nm. It also reveals that complex T2T designs (e.g. staggered T2Ts) have lower contrasts. Additional care is needed in OPC other than avoiding such patterns in design. Our study confirms the potential replacement of 0.33 NA 3- to 4-time multipatterning by 0.55 NA single patterning.", "Source mask optimization (SMO) is one of the most widely employed techniques at 7nm technology nodes. As new lithography techniques develop, lithography metrics of SMO used in cost functions (CF) are also developing quickly. Besides the standard critical dimension (CD) and edge placement error metrics, image log-slope (ILS) and ILS-DOF are also significant, which are penalties in SMO CF. A novel contrast-aware SMO is proposed in this paper to improve ILS in current edge placement error (EPE) based SMO flow. The target ILS, an appropriate penalty weight and the cutlines which should be applied the specific process window metric should be adjusted in several SMO iterations. The corresponding mask optimization results based on the qualified SMO model may provide a qualified retargeting strategy at the same time.", "For 28 nm node semiconductor devices and beyond, more aggressive resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) such as sub-resolution assist features (SRAF), litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE), self-aligned double patterning (SADP), self-aligned quadruple patterning(SAQP), and source-mask optimization (SMO) are utilized for the low k1 factor lithography processes. The litho-to-etch pattern fidelity is extremely critical since a slight lithography pattern weakness (ex: photoresist (PR) thickness loss, profile roughness ...) may be worsened after etch process due to the pattern loading effect, which will then induce physical defects that affect the final electrical performance. Rigorous lithography simulation can provide a reference of pattern weaknesses to modify mask layouts; but it is incapable of full-field mask data preparation. The post-etch critical dimensions (CDs) with a high accuracy optical proximity correction (OPC) model has become an important component; but it requires massive wafer data of post-litho and post-etch CDs, and will increase the runtime of the OPC flow for OPC modelers. In our previous submission [1-2], we had brought forth an algorithm that utilizes multi-intensity levels from conventional aerial image simulations to assess the physical profile through lithography to etch steps, and proposed a novel litho-etch correction method without suffering the lithography process window of SADP process. In this paper, we have improved this methodology and introduced a new approach of virtual etch target (VET) with virtual etch target threshold to assess post-etch CDs for various applications of memory patterning (dense features by SADP or SAQP process) and logic patterning (random features of lines, trenches and holes) more efficiently. The results not only matched post-etch wafer data, but also agreed with post-etch process window. Furthermore, this methodology can be utilized in generic OPC and post-OPC verification procedures to improve final pattern fidelity for logic and memory products.", "Source Mask Optimization (SMO), which enables complex design geometries and improves lithography process window, is a key technology utilized in our hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturing. In this co-optimization technique, mask optimization has been extensively explored and well established in our community. However, source optimization of equal importance receives less attention even with a long history of development since 90s. In the source optimization, the light intensity from a source is generally perceived as a linear addition of intensity from each point source based on Abbe\u2019s method. The drawback on this common approach is that the computation is intensive and timeconsuming as it involves the convolution between the pupil function modulated by each point source and the input mask. Here we present an algorithm of calculating transmission cross coefficients (TCC) for each point source in an illumination source. By following the Hopkins\u2019s approach, the source TCC matrix can be interpreted as the summation of individual TCCs of point sources. Compared to the Abbe\u2019s source formulation, the proposed algorithm provides a simpler, faster and accurate source representation, which is believed to be beneficial to the source mask optimization.", "This work is evaluating Machine Learning (ML) architecture options for weak point detection methods embedded in Design for Manufacturing (DFM) signoff tools. As Deep Learning based models have been released into the customer design enablement space, we are investigating the tradeoffs between model simplicity, run time and prediction accuracy. With simpler model architectures, additional options for data augmentation become available that can potentially result in better model accuracy. For example, noise introduction in the training data set can help prevent overfitting and thus results in better model accuracy.", "Design rules are geometric constraints imposed on IC layout to ensure products can be manufactured at an acceptable yield. Designs are required to pass sign-off design rule check (DRC) before tape-out. Foundries rely on DRC to ensure designs they accept are manufacturable. DRC runsets must be accurate, complete, and reliable. DRC runset qualification is critical in technology node deployment and maturation. The number, complexity and variation of design rules grow dramatically with advancing technology nodes. This increases the QA challenge to ensure quality and accuracy of runsets and their interdependent rule operations. Traditional methods of migrating previous node QA patterns, manually crafting new testcases, and targeted-pattern generation leave gaps in advanced process node qualification coverage. We deploy a novel synthetic layout generation approach to produce large varieties of complex layouts with high design space coverage to thoroughly qualify runsets, make runset improvements and release quality PDKs. We employ guided random Monte Carlo layout generation with user-defined layout construction rules. User-defined rules inform DRC requirements and assign weighted priorities to guide layout design styles. We generate stress DR layouts and high pattern coverage, with DRC-clean patterns and with deliberate DRC violations, to validate expected DRC results and exercise entire rule decks. In this paper, we show how Synthetic Layout Generation is integrated into runset QA flows, automatically generating stress DR conditions that manual efforts often miss, expand layout pattern space coverage, and improve runset execution coverage leading to higher quality on-time PDK development, qualification, and release.", "Diversity of known hotspot patterns is important for hotspot detection and correction. Deliberate synthesis of hotspot patterns can improve such diversity. Machine learning generative network is a popular tool for image synthesis, but it should be trained with known hotspots anyway. We propose U-net hotspot generator. A key is to train the generator with CNN hotspot probability model, i.e. the generator is trained such that output is a variant of input image with high hotspot probability. The method allows any patterns, even coldspots, to be provided to the generator, which then yields their hotspot variants. Efficiency of hotspot generator is demonstrated through experiments.", "In this paper, we are presenting a smart and efficient methodology to select the most representative patterns on the wafer. Calibre-SONR is doing Smart down-sampling to patterns on the wafer based on their features and choose the most representative ones to be used in different applications. In addition, it gives the user the flexibility to choose the range of needed representative patterns to tune their models on. A comparison between SONR down-sampling and typical offthe- shelf down-sampling and clustering techniques is done. SONR gives better coverage to the unique patterns than other techniques and able to handle larger data sets.", "This paper demonstrates a new approach for hotspot detection in large design spaces. We present a new pattern matching technique, which is a multi-window pattern search that is deployed in a dynamic and precise way to search for similar patterns. Based on the matched locations the flow extracts and combines silicon awareness features and design level features to build comprehensive feature matrix that can be used in subsequent analytical analysis. The paper also shows the advantage of using this flow with respect to precise capture of hotspot and ~10X improvement on turnaround time for feature extraction compared with traditional methods. The output of this flow also facilitates and improves the data preparation process for machine learning model building.", "MB-OPC contains a fragmentation step, in which each polygon edge is divided into a number of segments. Simple empirical rules dictate how the edges should be divided. Fragmentation strongly affects MB-OPC in its quality and runtime since OPC correction is performed segment by segment. Refragmentation using random forest classifier (RFC) is proposed. A segment and its surroundings are modeled using a number of features, which drive RFC to decide whether a segment should be further divided or not. It complements rule-based fragmentation in that small number of critical segments, which are not short enough and cause longer MB-OPC iterations, are quickly identified. When refragmentation is applied in standard rule-based fragmentation and MB-OPC flow, maximum EPE is reduced substantially (from 3.8nm to 2.4nm) with very marginal increase in the number of segments (7k to 7,093), yet OPC iterations are reduced (10 down to 8).", "Data augmentation is a powerful technique in deep learning to increase the number of training data by using limited original data. We apply this technique to EUV lithography simulation based on convolutional neural network (CNN). In previous work, we developed a prototype CNN which reproduces the results of the rigorous electromagnetic (EM) simulations in a small mask area. The prediction time of CNN was 5,000 times faster than the calculation time of EM simulation. We trained the CNN by using 200,000 data which were the results of EM simulation. Although the prediction time of CNN was very short, it took a long time to build a huge amount of the training data. Especially when we enlarge the mask area the calculation time to prepare the training data becomes unacceptably long. The EM calculation time for 1,024 nm X 1,024 nm mask area takes 162 s. It will take a year to calculate 200,000 mask patterns. The training data of our CNN is the diffraction amplitudes of mask patterns. Assuming a periodic boundary condition, the diffraction amplitudes of the shifted or flipped mask pattern can be easily calculated by using the diffraction amplitudes of the original mask pattern. We apply this data augmentation technique to reduce the data preparation time for 1,024 nm X 1,024 nm mask area by a factor of 200. The accuracy of CNN is verified by comparing the CNN predictions with the results of EM simulation. Our CNN successfully reproduces critical dimensions and edge placement errors of line and space patterns.", "Subresolution assist feature (SRAF) insertion is an effective way to improve the printability and lithographic process window of isolated and semi-isolated features. State-of-the-art works resort to machine learning to reduce the computational cost associated with model-based methods. However, the result of SRAF probability learning, a probability map, cannot be directly treated as SRAFs. Inserting an SRAF to each layout grid predicted as 1 leads to design rule violations. Therefore, the SRAF probability learning model can only guide SRAF insertion and needs special handling to place SRAFs. For SRAF placement, we observe that placing SRAFs at probability maxima might be too greedy so that the SRAF prediction is masked to a certain extent. Therefore, we propose a novel methodology for SRAF placement over a machine learning generated probability map. First, a clustering-based method generates an initial SRAF inserted layout based on the given probability map. Then, a two-stage SRAF legalization strategy modifies the positions of SRAFs to be compliant with design rules. Experimental results show that given a probability map, our methodology can generate an SRAF inserted layout which guarantees design rule violation freeness while maintaining competitive PV band and EPE.", "Matrix-OPC is used to mathematically derive mask bias using mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) matrix. Since MEEF denotes the edge placement error (EPE) change of segment induced by unit mask bias of its neighbor segment, exact MEEF calculation requires lithography simulation before and after perturbing neighbor segments. Therefore, MEEF calculation is a computationally expensive process, which leads to matrix-OPC being applied to only some critical regions in a layout. We propose fast MEEF prediction using an artificial neural network (ANN). MEEF represents the effect of one segment on another, so polar Fourier transform signals extracted from both segments are used as input of ANN. Also, the distance between two segments and the direction of each segment is used as input of ANN. Predicted MEEFs are used to construct MEEF matrices and matrix-OPC is used to derive mask biases. Experimental results show that proposed MEEF prediction is 3.7 times faster than exact MEEF calculation, thus matrix-OPC with predicted MEEFs is 30% faster than matrix-OPC with exact MEEFs.", "With the algorithmic breakthroughs in machine learning, increasingly more applications have been developed for computational lithography. In this paper, a pixelated mask synthesis method including After Development Inspection (ADI) contour and mask feature generation, was proposed by utilizing deep learning technique. Two Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were constructed, the first network was for mask to contour prediction, and the consecutive network was to perform design to mask correction. A pix2pix model was first trained to learn the correspondences between mask image and paired ADI contour image collected on wafer, thus the capability of printing prediction can be established. The well trained mask-to-contour model was then implemented as the simulator component of machine learning mask correction (ML-OPC) framework. Next, another unsupervised GAN formed the front-end of ML-OPC framework to synthesize mask patterns from any given design layout. Generated mask patterns were eventually optimized through minimizing pixel difference between design target and corresponding contour generated by mask-to-contour model. The experimental results demonstrated that our ML-OPC framework can mimic conventional OPC model to produce exquisite mask patterns and contours.", "The goal of this study is to discuss the findings of experiments we conducted to enhance defect capture rate in the advanced nodes design-for-manufacturing flow. As a metric of manufacturing excellence, wafer fabrication units track and report defect density on a regular basis. Fabrication with a reduced defect density can produce a higher chip yield. In recent years, systematic defects resulting from design and process have been predicted to be the leading cause of yield loss. This could result in a large rise in manufacturing costs and time. As a result, they are highly undesirable, and it is critical to accurately identify them for root analysis of weak patterns. Unlike random process defects, systematic patterning defects may show characteristic design features and our goal is to leverage these to create a machine learning model that can efficiently identify and categorize these defects before they get into production. An inherent problem that we face is class imbalance: high confidence defect data constitutes a few thousand samples for maturing nodes and nondefects of the order of millions. Additionally, millions of records in the train, test, and inference datasets, even with reduced feature sets, can lead to a host of big data issues like insufficient memory, large experiment times, and lack of integrated development. In this paper, we discuss methodologies to handle the large volume, imbalanced data which led to 47% improvement in the defect capture and 100% improvement in the noise to signal ratio.", "Retargeting-aware Design for Manufacturability (DFM) via-metal enclosure checks are developed using supervised machine learning to identify critical weak points to aid layout fixing. The machine learning model is developed using a neutral network architecture. Seventeen localized layout features were extracted, including: side and line end via-metal enclosure, via spacing to the neighboring features, and metal coloring. The extracted features were used to form feature vectors to train and generate a machine learning-based model for predicting post-retargeting, via-metal enclosures. This method was demonstrated on 22nm layouts. Using a neural network with 2-hidden layers, the predicted via-metal enclosure versus the actual data correlate with an R2 of 0.91 and an RMSE 0.0067.", "The Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) variation on a die is a function of the die\u2019s location on the wafer. For example, the post CMP thickness and/or topography variations in the center die can be very different from those in the mid-radius and edge dies. Consequently, the number of CMP hotspots and the hotspot locations can vary from die-to-die on a given wafer. Most commercial CMP simulation tools in the Design for Manufacturing (DFM) field focus on predicting CMP topography and thicknesses for a single die on the patterned wafer, and do not have wafer level prediction capabilities. For CMP simulation to be more effective in process and layout optimization, CMP simulation tools should be able to accurately predict CMP performance at the feature-scale, within the die, and across the entire wafer. In this paper, we analyze CMP data from multiple dies on back end of line (BEOL) Cu interconnect levels and show the wafer level effects in a polishing process. We use the data to calibrate Cadence\u2019s integrated wafer level and die level CMP models and use the calibrated models to predict the CMP pattern dependencies on multiple dies across a product chip wafer. Finally, we show a comparison of the simulation to measured data.", "Automated image analysis and image classification system that employs machine learning has been developed and applied to the PWQ/FEM flow to enhance the Process Stability Diagnosis (PSD) solution, which can now handle a significant volume of wafer images while realizing a 4X reduction in time to results. Moving the task of image analysis and classification to the computer has the added benefit of avoiding person-to-person inconsistencies in classification. The data flow consists of an automated machine learning-enabled process window analysis system that relies on CDSEM images taken on a FEM or Focus/Exposure Matrix wafer. We report results based on CDSEM images containing both contact hole and line features. The system enables full-wafer SEM image auto-classification and process window characterization.", "With the technology node scaling to 5 nm, the forbidden pitch effect caused by destructive interaction between main feature and neighboring feature always leads to poor process window. Due to the small critical dimension (CD) and pitch of these features, forbidden pitches (FPs) become more sensitive in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Therefore, controlling of FPs are becoming more and more critical. With the purpose of providing a strategy of mitigating the negative effect of forbidden pitch, an optimization method of the mask structure is developed in this paper. For illustration, three optimal mask structures under quasar illumination conditions are given by the optimized method. The performances of these three structures are demonstrated by the numerical lithography simulator S-litho. The effectiveness and validity of the proposed method are demonstrated from above simulation results. Therefore, the mask structure provided by the optimized method has the potential to be an efficient candidate for mitigating the negative effect of forbidden pitch structure.", "In the mask data preparation (MDP) flow, it is necessary to verify that layout structures are correctly placed and that specific critical dimensions (CDs) are correct. Certain layout versions of Electrical Test (ETest) structures are placed throughout various locations of the frame data which will be sent for fracture and mask production. Within each ETest structure, there are many sub-structures and gauge points where we want to verify dimensions and locations in the post fractured data. The current preparation flow being employed is error-prone and time-consuming, considering that the entire verification process is done manually. To address this issue, we have utilized a novel pattern search methodology that can measure and report gauge locations relative to unique identifier pattern locations which can all be reviewed graphically on the actual mask data. A full inspection point kit is first generated by a developer using automation scripts which allow graphical gauge definitions relative to a unique identifier pattern per ETest location. A revision-controlled pattern library is created to define the test patterns to be measured based on the technology product. A user can then take this kit and run all post-fracture reporting of ETest structures per tape-out. Correspondence with the mask shop is also simplified and discrepancies are easily verified. In this paper, we will discuss in greater detail how this pattern-based approach and the utilization of pattern libraries help us in significantly reducing the possible errors and verification time. We will also review how the entire process which includes the location measurement and the reporting structure to the mask shop can be fully automated, hence, improving the productivity and the turn-around-time for the mask manufacturing process.", "Forbidden pitches (FPs) effect is directly related to the loss of process window, which is caused by the difference of diffraction orders of patterns in some pitches. This paper analyzes the FPs effects in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography based on the rigorous imaging simulation and process window evaluation. In the rigorous simulation, S-litho is used to analyze the normalized image log slope of test patterns from critical layer, which allow us to find the weak pitches. Then, the process windows of these test patterns are evaluated using the lithography simulator Proteus WorkBench. This can find out the accurate FPs from the range of weak pitches. Finally, the strategy of mitigating the negative effect of FPs is proposed with the help of source optimization. Unlike deep ultraviolet lithography, the difference of FPs between vertical and horizontal direction is presented in the paper. The simulation results have effectively been used design rules.", "As critical dimension (CD) shrinks, the spec of CD uniformity (CDU) is getting tighter. To ensure CDU requirement, OPC team is making great efforts on etch proximity correction (EPC) than ever. For a long time, EPC only considers aperture effect which is usually simplified as a width and space rule table. However, astechnical nodes ever-shrinking, microloading effect plays a much more import role than aperture effect and rule table is not suitable any more. As in microloading effect pattern density is the key factor, we studied the density effect on dense array patterns with fixed CD and pitch in this paper. Firstly we designed a series of test pattern for calibrating an etch model, then we refined a simplified density rule table from the good fit (R2 >0.94) etch model. Contrast to traditional width/space rule table and complicated etch model, this approach is convenient and effective on dense array patterns EPC.", "Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is one of the most important techniques in improving the resolution and pattern fidelity of optical lithography in the semiconductor industry. As the feature sizes and the process margin in nanometer technology become smaller, OPC models also need to be more accurate. However, improving the model accuracy often requires collecting more SEM data, which in turn results in a longer time for the entire flow. Therefore, an efficient method that can improve the accuracy of the OPC model while reducing the data collection time is crucial. Furthermore, machine learning has recently been applied to the lithography optimizations with some success, so it will be a useful technique to further optimize gauge sampling. This paper proposes an efficient OPC model gauge sampling flow using machine learning methods through data preprocessing, feature transformation and clustering to divide sample data into clusters and select a small amount of representative sample data from them to calibrate the model, achieving the same effect as using all data to calibrate. In order to test and verify the proposed approach, we use various types of patterns including line-space, contact hole, etc., to verify our results. By optimizing the gauge sampling flow, we can reduce the gauge requirements and modeling run time without sacrificing the accuracy and stability of the model.", "Beyond the 40nm technology node, layout weak points and hotspot types increase dramatically. Many hotspots can be detected by OPC simulation. However, in advanced nodes, OPC simulation suffers from a long turn-around-time (TAT) and is challenged to handle the additional design complexity. Therefore, in order to speed up the process and OPC development, an efficient OPC hotspot detection method is required. This paper presents a flow using Pegasus Computational Pattern Analytics (CPA) technology from Cadence to extract a comprehensive set of patterns to build a pattern bank from a layout source. We can then compare two or more different banks (diffing) to find new patterns which have not been processed before. OPC engineers can analyze these new patterns to check for any OPC issues instead of simulating a full chip. This flow provides a much higher efficiency and better performance while allowing the storage of pattern banks over time to build history and yield experience. Over time, each new layout introduced for OPC can be processed faster because more patterns have been added to the banks and less simulation time is needed.", "3D topography imaging systems such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are used for surface characterization and metrology in numerous contexts especially when nanometer resolution is required (e.g. semiconductor industry & research). During the acquisition of an AFM image often a drift is present in vertical direction that is superimposed on top of the topography signal. This represents an artefact that cannot be removed with a single one-size-fits-all algorithm and typically requires manual input and expert assessment whether the correction is done appropriately. Hence, the final result is operator dependent. In this work we propose a method to correct various artifacts that arise from vertical (Z) drift that can be regarded a superimposed envelope (ENV) on top of the true topography of the sample. We remove this envelope with the help of processing the raw image data with the help of Deep Neural Networks. Moreover, we employ a normalization scheme for pixel intensities for the preservation of absolute vertical height values for corrected images thus allowing for quantitative measurements of topography for metrology needs. Our approach allows for automatic and operator independent data correction, leading to more robust data analysis and interpretation, enabling faster speed of learning", "Photoresist metrics such as resolution, roughness, CD uniformity, and overall process window are often aimed to realize the full potential of EUV lithography. From the view of the materials supplier, improvements over the aforementioned metrics can be achieved by optimizing the functional materials used under the resist. The underlayers can significantly enhance the resist performance by providing appropriate adhesive forces to the patterned features, counterbalancing the tendency of pattern collapse, and improving the resist/substrate compatibility. In this study, we introduce spin-on-glass (SOG) underlayers that can provide adhesion to resist through different mechanisms, including covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, and Van der Waals force. The underlayers were characterized in depth to understand their coating quality, adhesion to resist, and surface energy. The EUV lithographic performance was evaluated by applying chemically amplified resists (CARs) directly onto these SOGs for line/space features at the target pitch sizes of 30 nm and 28 nm. The lithographic evaluation indicates that the patterning performance strongly depends on resist/underlayer adhesion. By appropriately adjusting the resist/underlayer adhesion, we can realize 28 nm pitch printing with defect-free depth of focus larger than 300 nm and unbiased line-width roughness around 2.2 nm. The plasma etch rate of the SOGs were also evaluated to assess their pattern transfer performance.", "In extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), underlayers have been introduced to improve process window, stochastic printing failures, LWR and even photo-speed. As a result, studies about chemical and physical interactions at resist-underlayer interface have been reported and appropriate designs of silicon based hardmasks and thin organic underlayers for EUVL have been proposed for recent years. EUV underlayers are required to have not only chemical moieties for EUV specific functions but also proper physical properties. The thickness of underlayer has continuously shrink down to a few nanometers to reduce dry etch burden for effective transfer of small patterned features to substrates. In this paper, we report noticeable property variation of an organic underlayer thin film by confinement effect upon thickness reduction. We investigated the thickness effect on key factors, such as film density, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), film Tg and surface energy, and consequent impact on EUVL performance while chemical composition of underlayers were not altered.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is crucial to achieving smaller device sizes for next-generation technology, although organic resists face substantial challenges, such as low etch resistance, which limit the resolution of smaller features. Area-selective deposition (ASD) is one potential avenue to improve pattern resolution from organic EUV resists by selectively depositing material on one region of the resist, while preventing material deposition on an adjacent region. We therefore evaluate the compatibility of various organic EUV resists with area-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes, including considering the effects of photo-acid generator (PAG) and EUV exposure on polymer properties and selectivity. The thermal stability of thin resist materials at the TiO2 deposition temperature (125\u00b0C for 60 minutes) is confirmed with water contact angle and atomic force microscopy. Upon TiO2 ALD from TiCl4 and H2O, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry reveals successful TiO2 deposition on poly(tert-butyl methacrylate), poly(p-hydroxystyrene), and poly(p-hydroxystyrene-random-methacrylic acid) polymers, regardless of PAG or EUV exposure. However, TiO2 inhibition is observed on poly(cyclohexyl methacrylate). Thus, we demonstrate that EUV polymers can serve as either the growth or non-growth surface during TiO2 ASD, an insight that can be used to enable resist hardening and tone inversion applications, respectively. These results serve as a basis for further ASD studies on EUV resist materials to improve pattern resolution in next-generation devices.", "In this study, a molecular resist capable of high-resolution patterning with excellent sensitivity was pursued by introducing a metal atom into a small molecular fluorinated core. After selecting the phthalocyanine (Pc) unit as a molecular framework, exhibiting excellent chemical stability and etch resistance, fluorinated alkyl and aryl moieties and zinc atoms were incorporated into the framework to complete the synthesis of Pc-based EUV resists. Analyses of the recovered compounds were performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT IR), and ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy to confirm that the structures of the desired materials were secured properly. Through the electron-beam lithographic experiments, it was verified that all the thin films composed of the three Pc materials lost their solubility by interacting with high-energy electrons to form negative-tone images. When EUV lithography was carried out on ZnPc-A, which has linear perfluoroalkyl moieties, 40 nm-sized patterns were formed at the relatively small energy of 34 mJ/cm2. From the synthesis and lithographic characterization results, it can be assumed that fluorinated metallophthalocyanine materials can be considered EUV resist candidates. However, for highresolution patterning, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate film thickness and adjust the processing parameters, including the adhesion to the substrate.", "In this work, imec and Zeon introduce the resist with new concept and report the lithography performance. Zeon has developed a new resist (ZER02#05M) in order to improve both resolution and lithography performance because conventional Zeon resists generated worse resolution and kissing(C/H)/pinching(L/S) defects at tight pitch by top loss. The lithography performance at hexagonal contact hole (C/H) patterns with ZER02#05M is presented at ADI. For P40nm hexagonal C/H pattern in ADI by new resist, the lithography performance at CD17.5 nm in hole CD was achieved at the exposure dose of 92 mJ/cm2, giving a LCDU of 2.74 nm. It at CD18nm in P38nm hexagonal C/H pattern was resolved at 105 mJ/cm2, with a LCDU of 2.95 nm. t at CD18nm it at CD 17nm in P36nm hexagonal C/H pattern was resolved at 92 mJ/cm2, with a LCDU of 4.12 nm. Entire results with ZER02#05M could improve LCDU compared to ZER02#04DM, especially at larger CD. Additionally, patterning performance in AEI with 05 which did not optimize polymer properties could transfer patterns well and enhance LCDU compared to ZER02#04DM.", "The improvement of EUV photoresists is a key enabler for the deployment of High-NA EUV lithography and future technology nodes. Research in this field is supported by a joint research program between PSI and ASML. This program is dedicated to supporting the EUVL community with the development of materials by carrying out resist screening experiments with the EUV interference lithography tool at PSI, with an emphasis on resolution improvement towards reaching High-NA EUV scanner specifications. The tool enables high-resolution patterning without limitations in terms of chemical outgassing or contamination and is, therefore, an effective method for the testing of novel EUV photoresists. In this work, we consider the progress monitored in the second half of 2021. We describe the exposure tool as well as the updates made to the resist characterization metrology implemented at PSI. Resist performances are quantified with regards to resolution, linewidth roughness, and sensitivity. We show an overview of the current development status through a comparative study of different resist platforms. Recent results show chemically amplified resists (CAR) and non-CAR printing 12 nm and 11 nm lines/spaces features, respectively. Limitations of each platform are displayed and general progress and perspectives are discussed to lead the way to higher resolution results.", "Single exposure EUV patterning for lower pitches (below 32 nm L/S) proves to be challenging and dependent on a series of factors including exposure tool related parameters such as illumination conditions but also material related parameters such as sensitivity to EUV photons and resist chemistry. While the industry is focused on developing a set of universal exposure conditions that can be applied to all resist systems, material suppliers must constantly enhance the exposure mechanism of the resists in order to support further advance in technology. The multi-trigger concept involves a reaction that will only occur when multiple elements of the resist are initiated concurrently and in close spatial proximity in order to enable the catalytic reactions. In high dose areas the resist behaves like a traditional CAR, whilst in low dose areas, such as line edges, the reaction is second-order increasing the chemical gradient. Effectively there is a dose dependent quenching-like behaviour built into the resist, enhancing chemical contrast and thus resolution, whilst eliminating the materials stochastics impact of a separate quencher reducing roughness. The multi-trigger resist (MTR) presented consists of a novel multi-trigger control molecule and a crosslinker, which represent the resist matrix, together with a photoacid generator (PAG). Here we present results from work focused on the enhancement of the high-opacity MTR resist. The absorptivity of the resist can be increased by replacing the standard crosslinker with a high-opacity crosslinker. The absorptivity of the crosslinking molecule can itself be changed by varying both the number of attached photo-absorption groups and by varying the specific choice of the high opacity group. Other modifications to the crosslinking molecule, which are presented, include reducing the steric hindrance of the molecule by changing the structure. The high-opacity crosslinker molecules have been synthesized and then formulated into the MTR resist. We report results obtained using the new MTR system containing this high-opacity cross-linker with a variation of process conditions, and with formulation variations. The lithographic performance of a formulation containing this crosslinker, at pitch 32nm patterned on an NXE3400 is presented. The sensitivity of the resist can be increased by 25% by varying the length of the crosslinker arm whilst keeping other factors such as the number of high opacity groups constant. Furthermore, we have also investigated increasing the activation energy of the self-quenching aspect of the MTR system. In the case presented, MTR8 has a higher activation energy than MTR2 and MTR4. Having a higher activation energy is predicted to allow the introduction of a post exposed bake (PEB) to increase crosslinking and reduce pattern collapse, whilst simultaneously preserving the self-quenching behaviour. We will present results which show using a higher activation energy molecule (MTR8) results in a minimisation of Z-factor and LWR, when increasing the PEB temperature by 10 degrees compared to MTR4. Pitch 32nm dense line spaces can be patterned at a dose of 49.5mJ/cm2, a line width of 15.5nm and an biased LWR of 3.69nm. Pitch 28nm dense patterns can be patterned at a dose of 59mJ/cm2, a line width of 12.5nm, and a biased LWR of 3.91nm. These resist formulations have also been used to pattern 25nm diameter pillars on a 40nm pitch with a dose of 50mJ/cm2, and a CDU of 2.98nm. High photospeed approaches, which have patterned p24 and p28 lines and p34 hex pillars at sub-30 mJ/cm2 doses are also introduced", "Scissionable polymers are polymers that will depolymerize under different stimuli including acid, base, and free radicals. These polymers have been investigated in the development of photoresists and other degradable materials. This work focuses on the poly(phthalaldehyde), PPA, a family of scissionable polymers. The PPA backbone consists of acetal linkages that are very sensitive to acids. Upon exposure to acids, the polymer chain depolymerizes to its corresponding monomers. This depolymerization behavior makes PPAs excellent candidates as photoresist materials. Several new PPA photoresists are being explored in this work.", "Characterizing chemical changes in photoresists during fabrication processes is critical to understanding how nanometric defects contribute to film stochastics. We used Nano-Projectile Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NP-SIMS) to evaluate the nanoscale homogeneity of components in positive-tone extreme ultraviolet resists. NP-SIMS was operated in the event-by-event bombardment/detection mode, where a suite of individual gold nanoprojectiles separated in time and space stochastically bombard the surface. Each impact ejects secondary ions from a volume 10-15 nm in diameter and up to 10 nm in depth allowing for analysis of colocalized moieties with high spatial resolution. Individual partially exposed EUV resists were analyzed after light exposure, postexposure bake (PEB), and development. Results showed an expected increase in protonated quencher versus exposure dose, while after development we observed increased abundance in the remaining film. The latter we attribute to poor solubility in the developing solvent. Examining the photoacid generator, PAG, we found decreased PAG cation abundance versus exposure dose in the exposed films, likely due to photodecomposition of the PAG cation. Moreover, after development we observed decreased homogeneity of PAG ions, which we attribute to preferential extraction caused by ion-exchange interactions with the developer. We found that the insoluble moieties persisting on the surface after development were relatively rich in the protecting group, likely due to uneven deprotection of the polymer. Overall, NP-SIMS allows to characterize the resist at the nanoscale and identify conditions that lead to defect formation.", "Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) aqueous solutions has been used as a developer for chemically amplified resists (CARs), dissolving polymer with polar groups generated by exposure. Although the dissolution kinetics of CARs has been widely studied, it is necessary to understand molecular-level information such as interaction between polymer chains, to consider the dissolution of thin and minute resist films that are used nowadays. In this study, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to study the state of PHS chains in TMAH aqueous solution. The effect of the concentration of each ionic species on dispersion of PHS chains was investigated using solutions whose base concentrations were changed by two methods: dilution with pure water and neutralization with acid. PHS chains were well dispersed as the base concentration and ionic strength of the solution increased, while they aggregated as these two factors decreased. We also studied the dissolution behavior of PHS films under nearly identical conditions using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The dissolution of the films was also affected by the two factors described above. In addition to this, with the decrease in the above two factors, we observed formation of large swollen layer as we have reported in the past. We assumed these effects on dissolution of films were mainly due to the acid-base equilibrium at the solid-liquid interface.", "The next-generation extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tool, i.e., the high-numerical aperture (NA) ASML EXE system is now under preparation. As a consequence of the 0.55 NA, EXE scanners decrease the depth-of-focus (DoF) drastically, which requires much thinner photoresist thickness. However, a thinner photoresist process causes line edge roughness (LER) increase. Therefore, roughness mitigation is one of the key elements of high-NA EUV process development. We have studied how to heal LER of thin photoresist processes by illumination and mask. Rigorous simulations were conducted by Sentaurus EUV lithographyTM (S-litho EUV) software provided by Synopsys on a calibrated stochastic Inpria metal oxide resist (MOR) model to adopt the correct photoresist parameter set. Unbiased LER values were experimentally measured on half pitch (hp) 14 nm and 24 nm line and space (LS) as a function of normalized image log slope (NILS) and photoresist film thickness. 24nm hp on 0.33 NA corresponds to 14nm hp on 0.55 NA from the viewpoint of k1 factor (~0.57). NILS of these LS patterns was varied by changing illumination (dipole and annular). By comparing the experimental LER values on silicon with the simulated results, we predicted the LER performance of high-NA EUVL on 14nm hp LS pattern. In this research, we will discuss the better material condition for reduced LER of fine LS pattern at high-NA EUVL.", "Virtual fabrication is used to evaluate the performance of interconnects (line and via resistance, capacitance, etc.) across pitches compatible with either EUV single exposure or SADP for three different process flows: single damascene, dual damascene, and semi-damascene (subtractive metal etch). The effects of process variation for the three flows are also investigated to determine the relative importance of process flow, variation, and scaling when moving toward aggressive pitch interconnects.", "In this paper, an active area cut approach using a self-aligned double patterning process for advanced DRAM was studied using virtual fabrication. The mandrel critical dimension, mandrel line edge roughness, mandrel overlays and spacer thicknesses were selected as input process variables in the virtual DOE to investigate their sensitivity to the final fin cut head to head (HTH) critical dimension (CD) and its uniformity (CDU). For the mean CD, the study illustrates that maximum mean CD can be obtained at a combination of mandrel CDs when the mandrel overlays approach a value of zero. The overlay of mandrel 1 in both the X and Y direction appears to have a stronger impact on the mean CD than the overlay of mandrel 2. We determined that the mean HTH CD decreased 0.44 and 0.93 nm, respectively, when the spacer 1 and spacer 2 thickness were increased by 1 nm. Our simulations also show that CDU is strongly impacted by the mandrel line edge roughness (LER), at a sensitivity of 1.16 nm / 1 nm. The lowest variation and maximum mean CD can be obtained using particular combinations of mandrel 1 CDs and spacer thicknesses. Overlays do not impact the final HTH CDU. From our study, we can provide clear guidance to developers about the relationship between process parameters and final HTH CD and CDU, showing that the integrated process should be centered at particular conditions to obtain an optimal process window.", "This paper reports the readiness of key EUV resist process technologies using Metal Oxide Resist (MOR) aiming for the DRAM application. For MOR, metal contamination reduction and CD uniformity (CDU) are the key performance requirements expected concerning post exposure bake (PEB). Based on years of experience with spin-on type Inpria MOR, we have designed a new PEB oven to achieve contamination mitigation, while keeping our high standard of CDU. The new bake oven was introduced in our coater and developer and evaluated using line/space patterns. As described in the results, exceptional CD uniformity was realized while exceeding the metal contamination specification. The new plate design also enabled a 30% reduction in dose-to-size without degradation of CDU when applying higher PEB temperature. Another challenge for the DRAM application in particular is pattern collapse as applied to pillar patterns. By optimization of several parameters, the pattern collapse margin extended the minimum CD by 13.8%. The result was achieved with a combination of SiC in place of SOG for under layer, thinner resist film thickness and a modified resist material, MOR-B. Finally, to achieve target yield performance, defectivity reduction is also an important task towards MOR application. An integrated approach is needed to realize scum free patterning because if metal residuals remain in the open space, they can cause yield-killing defects. By analyzing possible root causes of defect sources, we attempt to eliminate etch-masking scum layer present after conventional developer processing. By applying a post develop rinse including novel hardware for defect reduction, bridge defects were reduced up to 19% with new the technology.", "The application of metal-oxide resist (MOR) for mass production is highly expected since MOR has an advantage of higher resolution. However, the metal components itself has a high risks of metal contamination and the defects based on metal components. Therefore, control of defects is more important than conventional chemically amplified resist (CAR). In this paper, reduction of defect densities are examined by latest technologies in the coater/developer. As results, on pillar pattern, many fall-on and scum defects were observed and majority of them were transferred to underlayer by etching process. In order to reduce the fall-on and the scum defects, three possible solutions were proposed. First, the latest resist supply system was designed for MOR. In addition, particles emitted from the latest supply system was reduced compared to the conventional system. Second, improvement of purity of the developer solution contributed to the reduction of fall-on particles. Third, application of the optimized rinse after development reduced 12% of the scum defect on the pillar pattern after lithography. It contributed to 19% (single bridge) and 18% (multi bridge) reduction after etching process. Furthermore, the optimized rinse reduced the single bridges on the line and space (L/S) pattern by 14% after etching process. These proposed three technologies are expected to be utilized for high volume manufacturing.", "Stochasticity is a major contributor to the resolution limit of fine mechanics and optical imaging, which is also an obstacle for achieving cutting edge EUV lithography performance. The root cause of stochasticity comes from the pattern edge random variation within the resist after exposure due to low contrast. High substrate adhesion is also very fatal as it further aggravates the variation at the substrate due to increased interaction, leading to stochastic failures. In this paper, Stochastic Area Thickness (SAT) and Dynamic Stochastic Area Thickness (DSAT) are used to evaluate the stochastic interactions. High optical foot exposure is proposed instead of conventional low substrate reflectivity to reduce SAT. Adhesion control by acid/quencher loading is proposed to minimize the stochastic interaction between resist and substrate.", "Defect source reduction in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) photoresists is a critical requirement to improve device performance and overall yield for a seamless transition to high volume manufacturing, especially for technologies in the 3 nm node and beyond. This is particularly true considering the increased influence of stochastic imaging defectivity in EUV relative to prior lithographic technologies. Filtration is one of the key enabling technologies to maintain a material\u2019s purity and therefore enhance process performance, beginning when the photoresist is manufactured, and continuing until the photoresist is dispensed on a wafer. We have previously presented a novel filtration technology development to maximize filtration efficiency for specific contamination sources and reduce defectivity in EUV photoresists. In this paper, further results and possible defect reduction mechanisms will be updated and discussed to address stochastic issues, specially variability of polymer molecular weight distribution in EUV CAR (Chemically Amplified Resists) photoresists.", "We discuss the importance of resist loss in resist calibration under multi-patterns and put it into resist calibration flow. The work is based on the exposure-focus data matrix which includes a mass of CD values obtained by experiments with step-variation setting of exposure and focus in ArF lithography. We focus on the Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) between experiments and simulations for calibration. The model after calibration with only CD values including could predict that the RMS is low to 2nm for single pattern, and to 5nm for several pattern. However, the cross section image predicted by the aforementioned model is not correspond with the experiment scan imagery. The resist loss adding to flow could improve that and increase the model predictability. Most importantly, it will be shown that calibrated resist models based on several patterns data could predict the resist profile of the other patterns.", "EUV chemically amplified resists (CAR) use a copolymer containing highly-polar poly hydroxy styrene (PHS), which is believed to easily aggregate and form gel-like polymers. These aggregates likely generate microbridge defects, an important yield detractor in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing. Improvements in EUV photoresist quality and a reduction in on wafer defectivity require more selective removal for this specific contamination source. Earlier presentations have demonstrated the benefit of effective removal of gel-like polymers in ArF immersion photoresists using photochemical filters with functionalized membrane technology [1]. In this paper we introduce a new filter technology for gel-like polymer removal in EUV photoresists. This contamination control technology demonstrates improved efficiency for removing partial, highly polar chemicals and fine particles that cause gel-like polymers over previous filter generations. The filter also improves on wafer defect counts.", "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is an indispensable device in inspection of photoresist and etched Si patterns. On the other hand, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation offers high resolution in lithography fabrication. Owing to the application of EUV, the feature size of photomask produced by electron beam (EB) lithography is reduced as well. The reduction of feature size made the information extraction from SEM image difficult due to the technical limitation. This proceeding reports a strategy to extract the information of line-and-space pattern. The main step classification of line, space and edge class was realized by unsupervised machine learning \u2013 hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering can integrate the brightness and coordination information in classification, and thus the classification ability of it is better than image thresholding. Furthermore, the classification result was used in prediction for etching pattern. The precision and recall of prediction were verified by confusion matrix.", "Continuous shrinking of semiconductor manufacturing node requires smaller critical dimension (CD) and higher pattern density, but also a better control of pattern local variability such as local CD uniformity (CDU). Thus, improving the process stability has been shown to improve local variability. Shrinking makes also crucial to control the process-specific patterned defectivity, with a more demanding defect detection and removal effort, which will depend on the mask level and stack materials. Therefore, integrating a new process in a recently installed immersion lithography cluster requires a thorough study of the influence of the track parameters in the specific process flow, as well as the use of last generation optical defectivity inspection, review and classification tools. In this work, we present the main results in the cooptimization of CD control, CD uniformity and after development inspection (ADI) of defectivity in a PTD immersion lithography process. The mask used is a gate layer targeting 42nm dense lines using a trilayer with topcoat lithographic stack.", "Removing metallic contaminants from the photochemical supply chain is critical for the creation of high yielding, highly reliable semiconductors. Metallic contaminants may lead to various types of defects, such as cone defects, that can result in significant yield loss and degraded long-term reliability. This makes control of metallic contaminants even more critical in advanced photolithography processes, where the device reliability demands metal contaminants at parts per trillion (ppt) levels. Previous work3 demonstrated the ability of two purifiers, PurasolTM SP and SN, to reduce the metal contaminants in a variety of organic solvents. In this paper we will discuss our continued work to reduce contamination sources that can contribute to defect formation in photolithography applications.", "Still acknowledged as a peculiarly challenging module, the Dual Damascene (DD) in via-first approach is constantly the object of an improvement effort, through many ways: I) testing new materials, II) tuning the coating/baking recipes and III) varying the scanner illumination conditions. The extensive characterization involved, in this case, a KrF 4-layer stack, in which the under-layer gained the role of both vias-filler and flattening material, thanks to the evaluation of many parameters like the introduction of a multi-bake route and the variation of the film thickness. The stack, customized to guarantee the etch feasibility, implied: the usage of a hard mask to allow the digging selectivity, a Bottom-Anti-Reflective-Coating (BARC) to avoid any back-reflection coming from the Silicon oxide substrate and the PhotoResist (PhR) on top. Evaluating different illumination modes, this study demonstrated how the tuning of the Numerical Aperture (NA) and of the \u03c3 values can be a feasible solution to decrease the swing effect entity; being it responsible, in most cases, for large dimensional variations when encountering small film thickness intra-die biases. Process Window (PW) and Depth of Focus (DoF) were analyzed thanks to the usage of properly designed test vehicles, to check the definition of the expected structural dimensions. This gave the opportunity to improve the Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU), always remaining a key topic, especially when dealing with devices addressed to the automotive market.", "Selective plasma etching among different dielectric materials is crucial to the manufacturing of advanced logic and memory devices. For instance, in self-aligned contact (SAC) etching, achieving highly selective SiO2 etching over Si3N4 is essential. By contrast, in self-aligned multi-patterning (SAMP), selective Si3N4 spacer removal over SiO2 and Si is necessary. To effectively control the relative etch rates of various dielectric materials, etch gas chemistry optimization [for instance, see J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 36, 040601 (2018), J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 34, 041307 (2016)., J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 35, 01A102 (2017), etc.] has been extensively investigated. On the other hand, hardware capabilities such as direct current superposition (DCS) and must also be considered for their effects on plasma physics and plasma-surface interactions. In this study, we examine the etch behavior for various dielectric materials e.g. SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k dielectrics in a TEL dual-frequency CCP chamber. Specifically, we focus on the gas ratio and DCS effects in a CF4/H2/Ar plasma. Contrary to the monotonically decreasing etch rates for SiO2 and low-k vs. increasing H2/CF4 flow ratio in accordance with decreasing F/CFx density ratio, the experimental blanket Si3N4 etch rate exhibits a local maximum at H2/(CF4+H2) = 15%. Chamber-scale plasma simulations using the Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM) indicate that the HF density is peaked at almost the same gas ratio. In addition, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal hydrogen\u2019s role in modifying the Si3N4 surface through N-H bond formation, thereby creating a hydrophilic surface on which HF adsorption is enhanced. Finally, computed reactant flux trends also demonstrate that the effect of DC superposition (DCS) on the relative orders of various ion and neutral reactant fluxes to the wafer is significantly weaker compared to that of the H2/(CF4+H2) flow ratio. This suggests that the application of DCS aimed at differential charging mitigation is not expected to induce major changes in inherent material etch selectivity. These fundamental learnings provide insights to guide process development and optimization for common dielectric etch applications.", "This paper demonstrates a full-chip OPC correction flow based on deep-learning etch model in a DUV litho-etch case. The flow leverages SEM metrology (eP5 fast E-beam tool, ASML-HMI) to collect massive data, automated metrology software (MXP, ASML-Brion) to extract high quality gauges, and deep-learning etch modeling (Newron etch, ASML-Brion) to capture complicated etch behaviors. The model calibration and verification are performed using a combined data from a test and real chip wafer to ensure sufficient pattern coverage. The model performance of Newron etch is benchmarked against a term-based etch model, wherein Newron etch model shows significant accuracy improvement in the model calibration (<50% for test patterns and <35% for real chip pattern). The Newron etch model is proven stable with a comparable performance in the model verification. Particularly, strong loading effects from underlying sublayer are observed in the full chip wafer, and effectively captured by the Newron etch with a sublayer-aware model form. The calibrated Newron etch model is successfully applied in a model-based etch OPC tape-out with new mask design rules but the same litho-etch process conditions. Compared to the term-based model, Newron etch also shows significant accuracy improvement.", "The development of new technologies and advanced nodes is capitally intensive due to process design strategies that involve dependent unit processes with different yields and performances. This has led to the exploration of model-based optimization to cut the cost and time of recipe creation; however, computational optimization of semiconductor processes is quite challenging due to multi-dimensional parameter spaces and limited experimental data. SandBox Studio\u2122 AI is a computational tool that automatically builds a hybrid physics-based and machine learning model that can be used to predict optimal process recipes and explore novel process changes such as different incoming mask geometries and step durations. Herein, we show the utilization of SandBox Studio\u2122 AI to build a computational representation of a cyclic etch and deposition process of a high aspect ratio channel etch with the following detrimental effects \u2013 bowing, resist over-etching, clogging via deposition, and twisting. The model was calibrated to a synthetic data set of thirteen experiments with five varying process parameters. Then, an optimal recipe was predicted that minimized the observed detrimental effects. The model was then used to explore different incoming mask geometries and step durations to improve the recipe even further. This capability is made possible by the software\u2019s foundational physics-based model and is not possible using conventional statistics and machine learning based tools.", "Switching of phase change memory (PCM) materials between crystalline and amorphous phase with electrical pulses and optical properties make it an important candidate for storage class memory and neuromorphic computing. However, PCM materials can be sensitive to air exposure during integration, therefore in-vacuo RIE and encapsulation is important to provide the required oxygen diffusion barrier. Low temperature SiN deposition can be used for low thermal budget integration schemes provided a good film conformality is achieved and damage or etching to the PCM elements is mitigated. In this work, ammonia- (NH3-) free, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) SiN films deposited at 40\u00b0C (microwave plasma) and 200\u00b0C (inductively coupled plasma), are compared and wet etch rates and optical properties are evaluated. NH3-free SiN films were deposited using SiH4, N2, H2, and Ar as source gases. Tuning the plasma parameters during encapsulation we observed simultaneous selective etching of GST and controlled SiN film deposition. Hydrogen and argon addition to the plasma mixture provided the main control knob for in-situ GST trimming during deposition, avoiding any type of elemental or structural damage to the GST films.", "In this talk we present core technology solutions for EUV Patterning and co-optimization between EUV resist and underlayer coating, development and plasma etch transfer to achieve best in class patterning performance. We will introduce new hardware and process innovations to address EUV stochastic issues, and present strategies that can extend into High NA EUV patterning. A strong focus will be placed on dose reduction opportunities, thin resist enablement and resist pattern collapse mitigation technologies. CAR and MOR performance for leading edge design rules will be showcased. As the first High NA EUV scanner is scheduled to be operational in 2023 in the joint high NA lab in Veldhoven, Tokyo Electron will collaborate closely with imec, ASML and our materials partners to accelerate High NA learning and support EUV roadmap extension.", "As conventional pitch scaling is saturating, scaling boosters such as buried power rail (BPR) [1-4] and its extension to backside power delivery (BSPDN) [5, 6] could provide 20% and 30% area gain [7], respectively. BPR can also help to improve SRAM design [8] and is a building block in novel architectures such as CFET [9, 10], for technology scaling beyond the 3 nm CMOS node. The two main features of BPR technology include: (i) the introduction of BPR metal within the fin module (fig. 1). Metal insertion in front-end-ofline (FEOL) has a risk of tool/wafer cross-contamination. Ensuring that BPR metal is fully encapsulated during contamination critical processes such as epitaxy, is therefore, essential. A proper choice of metal limits the risk of device performance/reliability degradation from metal diffusion & mechanical stress. (ii) The addition of VBPR via connections from M0A contact level to the BPR lines. Its challenges include high aspect ratio (AR) patterning, achieving low resistance (R) and reliable contact with BPR. This paper reports an overview of BPR/Via-to-BPR (VBPR) module development and metallization options at BPR and VBPR.", "Buried power rail (BPR), a novel integration approach for further device scaling, brings in new patterning needs and requirements, the most importantly, the challenging middle-of-line (MOL) patterning process steps. In this paper, some of the critical plasma dry etch development processing results for the FinFET device flow with BPR integrated are presented. Mainly, the study was focused on plasma dry etch development of high aspect ratio Via contact to BPR metal (VBPR) and Trench contact etch (M0A) to the source/drain (S/D) device region. We demonstrate the short-free M0A (no attack on the neighboring gates) contact etch to the S/D, with the high etch selectivity values obtained in case of the dielectric SiO2 trench etch to the thin Si3N4 liner (deposited over epitaxial S/D), and subsequently the high selectivity values during SiN liner etch to the underlying S/D (SiN liner etch results in 0nm epitaxial film loss). Patterning of high aspect ratio (HAR) Via consisting of the multi-stack, SiO2/SiN/SiO2/SiN dielectric, landing on the bottom BPR metal was achieved, with the target critical dimension (CD) required to avoid shorting to the adjacent gates. Additionally, we report our learnings on how choice of buried power metal (W, Ru and Mo) impacts the etch requirements, i.e., the etch challenges associated by using Ru and Mo as a replacement for standardly used W metal.", "In order to fully utilize the potential of the latest and greatest scanner overlay performance capability in a manufacturing environment, all other (process-induced) overlay contributors should be well understood and eliminated where possible. While overlay penalties that slowly vary across the wafer and/or within each exposure field can easily be corrected with the available scanner correction knobs, this is less likely going to happen for overlay signatures that manifest themselves on a much shorter length scale. We refer to length scales that are comparable to the floorplan of the integrated circuit itself. A deep understanding of these process induced overlay contributions is required to take away their root causes. Several non-scanner overlay contributors are known that may have an impact on the scanner exposure field overlay performance. Of course, the quality of the mask itself plays an important role. Mask writing errors correlate one-to-one with the on-wafer overlay performance. Local stress effects may contribute to the intra-die overlay performance too. We extensively addressed the layer stress impact on the intra-field overlay in an earlier publication. In that work, an interesting observation was made. The etch-induced overlay contribution turned out to be largely independent of the layer stress in which the pattern was etched. The conclusion was drawn that the etch-induced overlay penalties can be optimized separately from layer stress related overlay effects. In this work, the focus will be on the etch-induced overlay penalties only. We addressed the etch-induced overlay impact already before. Surprisingly, the etch-induced overlay penalties showed up in every exposure field despite the fact that the etch tool itself is not exposure field aware. For the use-case we investigated, the magnitude of the etch-induced intra-field overlay penalty was around 1-nm. This comes close to the scanner baseline overlay performance. A relation was found with the pattern density distribution and a dependency with the etch tool settings was observed. We identified the Spin-On-Glass and/or Spin-On-Carbon (Hard Mask) etch as the potential root cause. A hypothesis was proposed that was in line with the experimental observations. In this experimental work, we have continued the investigation by validating the hypothesis proposed earlier. Since the hypothesis was based on the pattern density distribution within the exposure field in combination with the deflection of ions due to surface charging effects, both the mask and the etch tool recipe settings per layer have been changed. We show that the etch-induced intra-field overlay penalties can indeed be controlled by changing the etch tool recipe settings per layer. However, the underlying mechanism turned out to be different from what we expected. In the current paper, we will present a new concept that much better explains all the experimental results we have obtained so far. Based on this new understanding, we experimentally demonstrate that etch-induced intra-field overlay penalties can be mitigated by optimizing the etch tool recipe settings.", "Identification of optimal recipes for multi-step and cyclic etch processes where the outcome of each step depends on the progression of the previous steps is a major challenge. Selecting the order and duration of each step is typically performed by a tedious trial and error process where the number of experimental trials scales exponentially with process complexity. Here we present a simulation-based methodology that significantly accelerates the process. We use limited experimental data taken at various process conditions, which may include pressure, gas type, gas flow rate, power, bias, and time to calibrate a step-aware reduced-order physics-based etch and deposition model. This model is used to generate predictions with steps permuted in any desired order and duration. The calibrated model predicts ordering, timing, and possible cycling of each step to achieve desired etch targets. The methodology is demonstrated on a multilayer stack with three possible steps, including etch and deposition. It is shown that the total number of experiments required for the proposed methodology is significantly less than that required by standard methods like full-factorial design of experiment. We also demonstrate how the etch data and the resulting calibrated model can be used to determine the optimal etch recipe for different aperture and/or mask geometries without having to perform further experiments.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has been used for mass production for several years. Now the resolution limit of current 0.33 NA single exposure has been approaching. To enhance the resolution limit, high NA exposure tool has been developing. At the limit, not only the stochastic failures1, but also patterning trade-off has been becoming challenging. In this paper, to overcome the patterning trade-off of LS and CH, several approaches were demonstrated for both CAR and MOR. As for chemically amplified resist (CAR), to overcome the patterning trade-off of line and space, two different approaches were demonstrated. One was a developer rinse process optimization, and the other was a top deposition treatment during etching process. By using the two approaches, pitch 24 nm LS patterns were successfully transferred. As to CAR CH patterning, a new shrink technique during etch process was successfully tested for sub 15 nm hole patterning. No missing hole detected at 12 nm hole size by voltage contrast metrology. For tighter nodes, spin-on metal oxide resist (MOR) have been considering to be used because it offers a series of advantages. It has high sensitivity and resolution because of its high photon absorption and simple reaction mechanism. It also inherently has a higher etch resistance which enables resist thickness thinner and collapse margin higher. Spin-on process of MOR is expect to contribute high productivity which is essential for high volume manufacturing (HVM). Because defect reduction is one of the key points to enable MOR process for HVM, continuous investigation of defect mitigation has been done. For pitch 32 nm LS, the mitigation was confirmed by fine optimization with the combination of the etch process and the implementation of new under layers. As to pitch 28nm line and space, optimized illumination gave better defect process windows. Moreover, a new wet developer process was successfully proposed to prevent pitch 36 nm hexagonal pillars collapse during wet development with 25% higher EUV sensitivity.", "3D topography imaging systems such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are used for surface characterization and metrology in numerous contexts especially when nanometer resolution is required (e.g. semiconductor industry & research). During the acquisition of an AFM image often a drift is present in vertical direction that is superimposed on top of the topography signal. This represents an artefact that cannot be removed with a single one-size-fits-all algorithm and typically requires manual input and expert assessment whether the correction is done appropriately. Hence, the final result is operator dependent. In this work we propose a method to correct various artifacts that arise from vertical (Z) drift that can be regarded a superimposed envelope (ENV) on top of the true topography of the sample. We remove this envelope with the help of processing the raw image data with the help of Deep Neural Networks. Moreover, we employ a normalization scheme for pixel intensities for the preservation of absolute vertical height values for corrected images thus allowing for quantitative measurements of topography for metrology needs. Our approach allows for automatic and operator independent data correction, leading to more robust data analysis and interpretation, enabling faster speed of learning"], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
