This development has been enabled by continuous resolution improvements of each generation of lithography scanners. Nowadays the most recent scanner generation is using EUV wavelength together with 0.33NA optics to image the patterning information of the mask onto the silicon wafer. They are used in high volume manufacturing to produce leading edge semiconductor devices. To further increase the resolution of EUV scanners ZEISS is working on next generation EUV optics with an increased NA of 0.55. This next generation optics consists of a highly flexible illumination system and projection optics with NA 0.55 enabling single-exposure sub 8nm half-pitch resolution to allow scaling beyond the next decade. In this presentation we will report on the status of the 0.33NA EUV optics being shipped in volume to the customer. Then we will give a short recap of the system design of the 0.55NA optical column and we will show the status of the high-NA program at ZEISS. We report on the high-NA infrastructure including mirror polishing, coating, surface figure metrology, mirror handling, and integration tooling. Progress in manufacturing of mechanics, frames, and mirrors for both illuminator and POB will be shown.", "A particle-in-cell model is used to investigate the dust levitation phenomenon. A submicrometer-sized silicon dioxide particle lying on a silicon dioxide substrate is exposed to a low-energy electron beam and the flux of ions and electrons from a cold plasma. The combined effect of ion and electron accumulation between the particle and the substrate is reported. The results are of interest for dust mitigation in the semiconductor industry, the lunar exploration, and the explanation of the dust levitation.", "Edge placement error (EPE) is a critical indicator for the imaging performance of semiconductor technology nodes, and is among others influenced by writing errors on the reticle. The impact of global mask variations is generally well understood and local variations are often considered to have a similar behavior. In this contribution we highlight the differences between the local and global mask variations and their impact on CD and placement in resist. We discuss the concept of local Mask Error Enhancement Factor (MEEF) and the impact of mask perturbation on neighboring structures within a certain interaction length. We show that local mask variations have a significantly smaller effect than global effects, which can have an influence on mask requirements. We show results of HyperLith simulations for a DUV use case of staggered contact holes arrays. We explore the prediction of the impact in resist of random mask fingerprints using impulse responses from single contact hole perturbation. We show that such prediction can be used to calculate the global MEEF from the local effects. The simulation results are compared to experimental data, measured in resist with CDSEM.", "Typical photoresists processes include a small set of photo-chemical reactions, with each reaction represented by many statistically identically distributed and independent instances. These instances eventually combine into the resist deprotection function, resulting, by virtue of the Central Limit Theorem, in Gaussian Random Field deprotection models. We discuss and demonstrate the approaches to calibration of such models, based on experimentally measured edges of lithographic features, their LER, LWR and PSD. We also present, discuss and analyze the phenomenon of \u201cspatial ergodicity\u201d and its effect on proper sampling of edge measurements for stochastic model calibration.", "Local CD uniformity (LCDU) is being considered as one of key parameter indicators of patterning quality control due to continuous pattern shrinkage and maintaining wafer quality in lithography process. In optical DUV lithography, LCDU has various contributors and they are systematic mask/OPC items, SEM metrology reproducibility, and stochastic effects. In stochastic term, it includes photoresist and speckle contrast. In general, photoresist is considered as the dominant factor in LCDU control, but speckle contrast is drawing attention due to importance of controlling LCDU in new device. Speckle is a light interference effect which causes the non-uniform dose delivery to mask and wafer, and we experimentally confirmed the effect of speckle contrast in several layers. In this paper, we will propose estimated the speckle budget of total LCDU in the target layers through the experiment.", "Maskless exposure makes possible of individual chip design customization and large area chip fabrication that are impossible with mask exposure. We are developing DUV optical maskless exposure tool named as Digital Scanner (DS) that uses a spatial light modulator as a pattern generator and a DUV solid-state laser as a light source (193 or 248 nm). We will report technology development progress of DS including the latest experimental data. Sub-pixel patterning capability by DS will be presented. Finally, we will discuss on the DS production tool with 248 nm exposure wavelength that are being prepared to release in mid-2020s.", "Advancing technology nodes in CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) continues to drive a shrinking process to acquire higher resolution and low power consumption as well as more cost-effective production. With the sensor pixel size scaling down, a thicker photoresist (with aspect ratios greater than 10:1) is introduced to block high-energy implants with extremely localized implant profiles. Then double exposures/double focus (DE/DF) is applied to make sure the resist profile and process window is comparable or better. However, this process is a big challenge at high volume manufacturing (HVM) phase because of throughput loss. To recover it due to DE/DF, we invented SE MFI which uses two wavelengths (\u201ccolors\u201d) generated by the KrF excimer laser to solve the problem. Due to the chromatic aberrations in the lens, the focal plane shift of different wavelength produces nearly the same result as DE/DF. However, the use of two-wavelengths brings some challenges. The first is the loss of image contrast and the second is the impact of chromatic aberrations across the slit which results in image shift and image asymmetry. In this work, we demonstrated that the use of ASML\u2019s Tachyon KrF MFI source mask optimization (SMO) that can match the MFI SE process to DE/DF process of record (POR). We first used Tachyon Focus-Exposure Modeling plus (FEM+) to calibrate a DE resist model by using DE POR wafer data. Then we converted the DE model to a SE MFI model. At the end, we use the Tachyon MFI-SMO to optimize the SE MFI to match the DE/DF and MFI sidewall profiles through process window conditions at the center slit. We achieved making the MFI and DE/DF sidewall difference significantly smaller than other noises which can be measured on wafer at the center slit. We evaluated the chromatic aberration impact on through slit sidewall profiles also meet the specification. The through slit matching between MFI and DE/DF was further improved by through-slit mask optimization. This is done by inserting asymmetry sub resolution assist features (SRAFs). Tachyon Optical Proximity Correction plus (OPC+) can support full chip mask corrections for full-chip HVM. The above MFI technology including Tachyon optimization capability will be verified by wafer exposure via comparison between MFI and DE wafer results.", "The road towards the next technology leap in EUV lithography is set. ASML and ZEISS have designed and started manufacturing the next generation EUV exposure tool. With a wafer side NA of 0.55, the High NA scanner system will support the further pattern node scaling roadmap by improving image contrast and therewith reduce LCDU and defect print rate on product wafer. As for all major steps in the lithography evolution, the whole infrastructure will develop further in order to support this next quantum leap in EUV technology, with the EUV photomask technologies and metrology tools representing an essential piece of the mosaic. The AIMS\u00ae EUV system represents a unique piece of the EUV mask infrastructure for the qualification of the mask printing performance in the aerial image. The AIMS\u00ae aerial image is by design targeted to match the scanner aerial image, as the tool is engineered to emulate all imaging relevant scanner properties, e.g., mask side NA, through slit chief-ray characteristics, aberration level, illumination schemes. For the emulation of the High NA scanner, ZEISS developed and started manufacturing an upgrade for the current existing 0.33NA AIMS\u00ae EUV platform. The same AIMS\u00ae EUV system is therefore capable of imaging 0.33NA isomorphic as well as 0.55NA anamorphic masks, providing the best-in-class performance for both imaging technologies and optimal match to scanner imaging. In this paper the first imaging results of the AIMS\u00ae EUV High NA tool are shown together with quantitative analysis of 0.55NA anamorphic imaging properties. The challenges of providing two intrinsically diverse emulation types (0.33NA isomorphic and 0.55 anamorphic) in one single platform are described together with the solutions which were implemented and tested.", "EUV lithography has been adopted worldwide for High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM) of sub-10nm node semiconductors. To support HVM, EUV pellicles were introduced by ASML in 2016, and more recently, pellicles made from novel materials were developed to offer higher transmission and support higher source powers. In this paper, we will give an overview of current EUV pellicles. Also, we will report on our continuing research to optimize EUV pellicles to transmissions of above 90%, and supporting EUV source powers of above 400W. Key performance indicators of such novel pellicles will be presented, showing the promise of these materials to support upcoming lithography nodes.", "Background: In EUV lithography, the absorber material determines the amplitude and phase of the diffracted orders, which define best focus (BF) and depth of focus (DOF). Control of BF and DOF is needed for mid and high numerical aperture (NA) systems. Aim: Generate recommendations for EUV absorber classes and explain the best focus shifts that occur for bright and dark field mask imaging. Approach: We anchor simulations with experiments using a TaBN absorber, then investigate the BF and DOF for various absorbers using simulation. We use a simple analytical model to show that the analytically predicted diffraction orders behave similarly in magnitude and phase to EMF simulations. Results: We find good prediction for BF experiments and simulations using a very simple resist model, and fair prediction in DOF. We explain the BF shift depending on simple absorber parameters using an analytical model. The exact BF shift needs to be calculated using EMF simulations. Conclusions: Best focus shifts are more pronounced for dark than clear field masks, and more so in attPSM materials than in more binary absorbers. Magnitude and phase of the 0th order plays an important role in BF shifts. We are encouraged to explore low-reflection attPSM materials as mask absorbers.", "An alternate mask absorber is a generally applicable approach as a mitigation strategy for Mask 3-D effects (M3D) observed in EUV lithography. It is also an efficient solution in a production-worthy environment compared to multilayer modification or Source Mask Optimization (SMO) techniques. Absorbers with a high EUV extinction coefficient k allow for lower Best Focus Variation (BFV) through pitch and reduced Telecentricity Errors (TCE). This study evaluates Ta-Co alloys as potential high-k mask absorbers. It includes an experimental study of film morphology, surface composition, and stability of Ta-Co alloys as well as a theoretical investigation of the imaging performance. The optical constants were determined from EUV angle-dependent reflectivity measurements for three selected compositions, viz. TaCo, Ta2Co, and TaCo3. The Ta-Co alloys exhibit a higher EUV extinction coefficient k compared to the currently used TaBN absorber. TaCo and Ta2Co demonstrated smooth surfaces, were stable in a hydrogen environment, and in mask cleaning solutions. These qualified compositions of Ta-Co alloys were selected for aerial image simulations and compared with a TaBN absorber. The optimized absorber thickness for Ta-Co alloy absorbers is based upon NILS enhancement, Threshold to Size (TtS) and balancing of diffraction order amplitudes. A 10 nm alternate line-space pattern with a pitch of 20 nm and 14 nm square contact holes with a pitch of 28 nm were considered for the simulation study using High NA 0.55 EUV lithography process settings. The through pitch imaging performance was evaluated using NILS, TCE and BFV as metrics. Ta-Co alloys allow for a reduction in M3D effects at smaller absorber thickness compared to a 60 nm TaBN absorber.", "Attenuated phase shifting masks (attPSM) for EUV lithography have shown the potential to improve the aerial image contrast through light and phase modulation and reduced mask three-dimensional (M3D) effects through thinner absorber. However, a robust optical design capable of generating almost identical performance for various patterns and feature sizes needs to be determined. The ability to identify and experimentally verify various mask absorber candidates is both challenging and expensive. Effective media approximation (EMA) identified material candidates have been shown to simplify the determination of material candidates through known optical constants of the constituent elements. An approach to engineer the desired optical properties and experimentally verify EMA modeling technique through multilayer thin films is presented. Mo \u2013 Ni multilayer films satisfying EMA requirement are deposited through RF magnetron sputtering. The verification of optical constants for multilayer films with 20%, 50% and 90% Ni volume fractions is performed at visible wavelengths through UV-Vis-NearIR variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE). EMA modeled multilayer absorber candidates are shown to have the flexibility in obtaining desired optical properties based on the layout-design requirements.", "In 2021 IRDS logic roadmap, required minimum contact/via pitch is 28 nm in 2025, which cannot be obtained by single exposure at 0.33 NA system using chemical amplified resist (CAR). To make the target possible, 0.55 NA system is the only way for single exposure. The relationship of resolution, roughness, and sensitivity has been known to be trade-off in CAR, and we tried optimizing them at 0.55 NA lithography simulation. For the optimization, not only resist material parameters, but also resist development parameters were adjusted. In addition, we conducted numerical simulation for line and space (L/S) pattern of metal oxide resist (MOR), which is expected as one of the breakthroughs for making narrower patterns. We set up a MOR NTD model and calibrated it by experimental data. The calibrated model is applied to the evaluation of the patterning performance including dose to size (DtS), roughness, and resist profile. Simulation results regarding a new wet development method for MOR to break through the RLS trade-off are introduced.", "The 7nm node is the first generation where EUV lithography has been employed to replace a few multi-patterning immersion layers in high-volume manufacturing. The insertion of EUV lithography in the 7nm node can simplify the production process, reduce the cycle time, improve performance, and enhance yield. However, in order to fully take advantage of these benefits, we need to overcome new challenges introduced by EUV technology. In this paper, we present how to integrate 193nm immersion and EUV lithography in production and optimize the critical steps in the process. Our 7nm product was initially taped out with full 193nm-immersion masks. When the immersion process stabilized with a decent yield, we taped out n EUV layers to replace 3n immersion layers in the product. To migrate our production from the immersion process to the EUV process smoothly, we started a few Lots with splits of the immersion and the EUV processes. Some wafers went through the full immersion lithography process and the rest of the wafers went through the hybrid lithography process with about n layers using EUV. At the end, we compared the Si data of the two processes. After a few iterations of tweaking, the EUV process can provide better performance and higher yield than the immersion process. In this report, we also provide examples of how the better CD control with the EUV mask can be achieved, the Edge Placement Error (EPE) can be reduced and the uniformity of the EUV back-end-of-line (BEOL) layer can be improved during EUV process development.", "Extending 0.33NA EUV single patterning to 28nm pitch becomes very challenging in terms of stochastic defectivity, which demands high contrast lithographic images. The low-n attenuated phase-shift mask (attPSM) can provide superior solutions for individual pitches by mitigating mask three-dimensional effects. The simulation and experiment results have shown substantial imaging improvements: higher depth of focus at similar normalized image log slope and smaller telecentricity error values than the best binary mask configuration. In this paper, the exploration of low-n attPSM patterning opportunity for pitch 28nm metal design is investigated. The lithographic performance of the low-n attPSM is compared to the standard binary Ta-based absorber mask. As well, the impact of mask tonality (bright-field vs. dark-field) on the pattern fidelity and process window is evaluated both by simulations and experiments.", "In order to improve logic via printing we propose staggered vias to effectively regularize randomly placed vias in a typical logic design. We accomplish this (i) by forcing via placement on a staggered sub-grid of the standard manhattan grid and (ii) by placing smaller fixed-size via Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAFs) on all remaining empty positions of the staggered grid. We devised a methodology to create such staggered via placement in a standard Place&Route (PNR) design flow and evaluated the concept on a 64-bit (64b) ARM core implementation through a PowerPerformance-Area (PPA) analysis. From a PNR run-time perspective and PPA analysis this looked a very viable implementation with little to no disadvantages compared to standard via placement. Finally, to experimentally test and compare staggered vias and against standard manhattan vias, we designed a via mask with both staggered and standard manhattan vias patterns and exposed them on an 0.33NA NXE3400 EUV lithography system. Analysis of experimental results on a 38nm via pitch show 40% smaller best-focus shift across the slit, and 20% smaller via-via CD variation for staggered vias compared to Manhattan vias with regular SMO.", "The use of a 4F2 cell configuration which enables higher densification is common in emerging memory devices. The pitch scaling and the robustness of these devices mainly rely on the patterning of the orthogonal array vertical pillar process. In this paper, we screen several lithography process approaches to optimize the 40nm pitch pillar patterning using single exposure EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography. The results show that with the optimized 40nm pitch process roughly 0.6nm 3-Sigma WCDU (wafer critical dimension uniformity) and 1.4nm 3-Sigma LCDU (local critical dimension uniformity) can be obtained post-litho for 21.1nm mean CD (critical dimension). Post-etch patterning with the best process shows 1.8nm 3-Sigma WCDU and 1.3nm 3-Sigma LCDU at 17.2nm mean CD. Smaller pitches have also been explored to identify the limits of the single EUV lithography process. Structures at 34nm pitch have shown high amount of pillar collapse. For 36nm pitch, on the other hand, a reasonable litho performance could be obtained with slightly boosted CD. The post-litho results show that with the optimized 36nm pitch process 0.4nm 3-Sigma WCDU and 1.4nm 3-Sigma LCDU can be obtained for 19.1nm mean CD.", "As overlay tolerances tighten node-over-node, the measurement and control of overlay has progressed from the low (spatial) frequent domain toward higher spatial frequencies. At present up to 3rd order in the (non-scanning) slit direction can be addressed on high end systems. With the introduction of an advanced distortion-manipulator on an ArFi immersion scanners a significant improvement in the spatial frequency of overlay control can be achieved. This actuator will now enable at least up to 9th order lens distortion manipulation and control in the (non-scanning) slit direction, with future extendibility to on-the-fly adjustments while scanning. The manipulator setup and distortion control is fully incorporated in the scanner software and allows for lens fingerprint optimization, better dynamic lens heating control, and scanner stability control to maintain overlay performance over time. Also an external scanner overlay optimization interface is made available that enables machine-to-machine matching within the immersion platform as well as for cross-matching to the EUV platform. Via this interface also high spatial-frequent process corrections can be send to the scanner. In this paper, we will show the capability of the scanner-integrated distortion manipulator on abovementioned aspects using on-scanner aberration metrology, and in-resist distortion and overlay metrology.", "With EUV lithography moved into volume production, it allows for a reduction of manufacturing complexity by minimizing the amount of pattern splits for critical layers. A key metric describing patterning capability , the total Edge Placement Error (EPE), scales with the technology nodes. As discussed in previous papers, overlay and OPC requirements are requested to scale faster than the EPE metric, in order to allow more room for stochastics in the total EPE budget. While the on product overlay (OPO) performance requirements continue to scale, these need to be met in a mix-andmatch mode of EUV and immersion DUV scanners. In this paper we will examine both EPE and OPO requirements for DUV and EUV scanners for advanced nodes. We will describe how multiple overlay metrology sources can be used to infer scanner corrections, how these systems are set up against a common reference and how we maintain this \u2018matched state\u2019 over time. As stated, these overlay improvements link back to the EPE budget and thus to its other components. We will describe how an enhanced view on EPE contributors will allow us to combine cross domain degrees of correction, during layer setup and control. Moreover, this EPE component breakdown will enable the ability to monitor this \u2018EPE state\u2019 by combining various sources of metrology; ultimately high spatial EPE variations may lead to a different scanner setup state. The need to describe the stability of all EPE constitutes warrants combining e-beam inspection systems with scanner, optical and SEM metrology to support diverse overlay, CD and control use models and process fingerprint mapping.", "We investigate the collisional radiative (CR) model of tin and heavier elements, to accurately predict their EUV emission spectrum to have a useful tool for the optimization of the source to obtain high output power and efficiency at 13.5 nm, as well as in 6 \u2013 7 nm region. Although, tin and heavy elements have a complex atomic structure and the emission occurs through a large number of fine structure transitions, their observed spectrum usually consists of few broad peaks, which are attributed to 4d-4f, 4p-4d, 4d-5p, and 4d-5f transitions. We show a simple representation of their wavelength from the investigation of theoretical and experimental spectrum.", "For finer linewidth patterning, 0.55 numerical aperture (NA) should be used instead of the existing 0.33 NA. In 0.55 NA extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), to alleviate the mask 3D effect and stochastic noise, which is stronger, it is necessary to develop an optimal phase shift mask (PSM) and multilayer mask for high NA. Mask structure is used PSM with composed of Ru-alloy/TaBO and multilayer composed of ruthenium (Ru)/silicon (Si), which is expected to be effective in mitigating mask 3D effect and improving imaging performance. The absorber reflectance was checked which is changed by variables such as pattern existence, target CD, and pitch ratio. In addition, by examining the relationship between the change in absorber reflectance and normalized image log slope (NILS), it was determined whether the mask structure for high NA was changed by the target pattern changes.", "Imec N3 logic design rules define a minimum via pitch of 36nm for a double patterning process. Enabling this pitch is crucial in terms of process time and number of masks involved. One method for extending 0.33 NA EUV is using advanced mask materials. Studies have shown that a low-n attenuated phase-shift mask (PSM) can improve EUV imaging performance, reduce mask 3D effects and improve optical contrast compared to the reference Ta-based mask. [1-3] In this paper, the impact of mask stack - Ta-based (binary or BIM) and low-n (PSM) - and mask tone - dark field (DF) vs. bright field (BF) - on a random logic Via layer will be evaluated. To pattern contact holes, we use negative tone development (NTD) metal-oxide resist process using the BF mask and positive tone development (PTD) chemically amplified resist process using the DF mask. Source mask optimization (SMO) was performed with and without subresolution assist feature (SRAF) as a resolution enhancement technology (RET). Optical proximity correction (OPC) was carried out on design clips using respective sources and mask rules at different mask tone. We show the optimum choice for this layer and present our recommendation based on current OPC simulations as well as some preliminary wafer data.", "Densification and reduction of lithographic features sizes keeping low defectivity is one of the biggest challenges in the patterning area. In order to extend 193 immersion capabilities and meet advanced applications needs, multi exposure image mode is a promising option for non-high volume manufacturing. It allows from a unique pattern with a fixed critical dimension (CD) and pitch, to obtain more dense patterns in a large surface without any process loop of standard flow, a huge benefit compared to litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE) approach. The study carried out explores this method with a specific design of pillars array printed using Negative Tone Development (NTD). The multi-image option relies on exposing multiple times the same initial pattern with a low image-to-image overlay. Based on intrinsic scanner performances, imageto-image placement error should be less than two nm. In this paper, many functionalities are explored to customize patterns from a single and unique mask design. One stake is to transfer (into silicon) a 2 mm * 2 mm pillar array design with a pitch divided by two, covering a wide surface on a 300 mm wafer and answering overlay and stitching requirements. Final results give well defined pillars which intra-wafer CD uniformity (3\u03c3) satisfies application process requests. By using a flexible multi-image mode, mask constraints (cost and quality) can be relaxed, i.e. with a larger pitch structure on the reticle than the targeted one, final feature can be achieved. This development can be extended to hybrid lithography such as NanoImprint Lithography (NIL) or specific applications such as optics.", "Discharge- and laser-produced plasma (DLPP) devices are being used as light sources for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) generation. A key challenge for both, DPP and LPP, is achieving sufficient brightness to support the throughput requirements of nanometrology tools. To simulate the environment of a hybrid DLPP device and optimize EUV output, we have developed an integrated HEIGHTS-DLPP computer simulation package. The package integrates simulation of two evolving plasmas (DPP & LPP) and includes modeling of a set of integrated self-consistent processes: external power source and plasma energy balance, plasma resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), plasma heat conduction, detailed radiation transport (RT), and laser absorption and refraction. We simulated and optimized DLPP devices using Xe gas as a target material. We synchronized the external circuit parameters, chamber gas parameters and laser beam temporal and spatial profiles to achieve maximum EUV output. The full 3D Monte Carlo scheme was integrated for detailed RT and EUV output calculations in Xe using more than 3600 spectral groups. The modeling results are in good agreement with Julich Forschungszentrum experimental data. Theoretical models, developed and integrated in HEIGHTS package, showed wide capabilities and flexibility. The models and package can be used for optimization of the experimental parameters and settings, investigation of DLPP devices with complex design, analyzing the impact of integrated spatial effects and working timeline arrangement on the final EUV output, and EUV source size, shape and angular distribution.", "We report the status of the CO2-Sn-LPP (Laser-produced-plasma) EUV light source development at Gigaphoton. It is the high power 13.5nm light source solution for the manufacturing of semiconductor pattern below 7nm. Our original technologies are a combination of a pulsed CO2 laser with Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser application and Sn debris mitigation with a magnetic field. Providing high EUV power with high operation availability is a requirement for the EUV light source system. With above technologies, we have demonstrated a collector mirror reflectivity degradation rate of less than -0.5%/Bp at an average power of 125W at IF during a week of operation. We also achieved an in-band power of 270W under dose-controlled operation and demonstrated a power scalability up to 365W. To achieve higher availability, we improved the two main factors that limit the operation availability, that are the lifetime of the droplet generator and of the collector mirror. We are developing a new long-lifetime droplet generator with an in-situ Sn fuel supply system. With this technology, we have demonstrated stable droplet generation continuously for more than 2000 hours. The mirror lifetime is determined by the reflectivity degradation of the multilayer coating, due to hydrogen blistering, oxidation, as well as sputtering, implantation, and deposition by Sn ions, Sn atoms, and Sn fragments. Since our magnetic mitigation scheme works effectively for lower energy ions, we developed advanced pre-pulse laser irradiation to suppress the generation of high-energy ions from the Sn plasma without loss of the high EUV Conversion Efficiency of ~6%. An in-situ shooting control system, which was developed for newly optimized laser conditions, remarkably improved the EUV energy and dose error 3\u03c3 by 50%. With this new shooting control technology, we demonstrated fragment-free EUV sample mirrors after a medium-term test at the EUV research source.", "The EQ-10 Electrodeless Z-pinchTM source uses Xenon plasma to produce 13.5 nm (\u00b11% BW) radiation. The source is used for metrology, mask inspection, and resist development. In this talk we will present modeling of the EQ-10 Z-pinch using the Trac-II radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) code. Specifically, we use RMHD calculations to explore development of the Electrodeless Z-pinch as a source of Blue-X (6.x nm) radiation. Critical to this study are the nonLTE effects on radiation physics and the equation of state. For this we rely on the FLYCHK collisional-radiative model to determine the radiative power loss. We also use the FLYCHK calculated emissivity to estimate the Blue-X power output. We revisit previous experimental attempts at obtaining Blue-X EUV radiation with neon gas. Having established a baseline of performance on our present Z-pinch system, we use RMHD calculations to scale to higher outputs of potential interest to the EUV community.", "Spin Orbit Torque (SOT) magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) offers the possibility to realize non-volatile ultra-high-speed technology. SOT-MRAM can also potentially reduce embedded memory footprint, which would inturn reduce silicon cost. However, there are certain challenges to overcome for SOT integration with logic. SOTMRAM needs a tall \u2018VIA\u2019 for the MTJ connection to the transistor. The height of this tall \u2018VIA\u2019 can vary from 60nm to 300nm for the N5 technology node. The VIA Critical Dimension (CD) depends upon metal width (30nm) which connects MTJ to read transistor. Thus, the aspect ratio needed for proper SOT integration is at least 10. This high aspect ratio is a major challenge for SOT integration, but it can be reduced (even down to 2) at the cost of SOT and MTJ stack integration complexity. On the other hand, keeping WL spacing constant and reducing WL width to facilitate increased MTJ connecting metal width (hence improve the AR for the same height) will increase the WL resistance. This WL resistance increment degrades WL delay as parasitic resistance is more problematic than capacitance at advanced nodes. In conclusion, while a tall VIA for SOT-MRAM has integration challenges due to the high VIA aspect ratio, mitigating this by means of wider VIA CD can potentially increase WL delay. Therefore, a comprehensive DTCO considering different bit-cells, SOT integration options and Memory performance is needed for SOT technology to be adopted at the most advanced technology nodes.", "In semiconductor manufacturing, yield and cost are important factors to predict and improve the productivity of manufactures. A yield prediction model and the corresponding cost of the ownership with advanced technology nodes beyond imec 5nm are proposed in this paper. In this study, the compact die yield data and the cost will be compared between imec 8nm, 7nm and 5nm technology nodes. With technology nodes scaling, the node-to-node scalability can be impacted by the process complexity, different number of layers, and chip size, etc. With proper process parameters, the yield per layer and the yield per chip can be extracted. In addition, the productivity and turn-around-time (TAT), also called cycle time (CT), can also be calculated based on yield and cost model with complex manufacturing process steps to improve the manufacturability and turnaround-time (TAT). The productivity can be easily evaluated by the yield prediction model since productivity and yield are inseparable in manufacturing. Based on the process assumption, the turn-around-time (TAT) can be precisely estimated by the result of the wafer process time including the time of each step provided by the imec database. As the scaling persists, growing complexity in semiconductor manufacturing gives rise to a concern on the yield and cost. We studied a yield model and the corresponding cost of the ownership for imec technology nodes to discuss their manufacturability. With technology nodes progression, the node-to-node scalability is shown to be impacted by the process complexity from the number of layers, patterning methods and chip size, etc. In addition, productivity and turn-aroundtime (TAT), also referred as the cycle time (CT), can also be estimated to be used as an important parameter to enhance productivity and optimize profitability in semiconductor manufacturing.", "This paper presents a new transistor design that enables scalability of a nanosheet field effect transistor (FET) architecture. By introducing an innovative patterning design for the nanosheets (a zigzag shape), the contacted poly pitch (CPP) can be reduced to a 30nm size. Semiconductor virtual fabrication was used to create virtual prototypes of this new device architecture and evaluate different process and design assumptions.", "Tuning the spectrum of a scanner\u2019s excimer laser light source is a well-known technique to achieve improved depth of focus (DOF) for an exposure. Previous studies have focused on the imaging improvement capabilities of readily available spectral shapes such as Gaussian E95 single peak width, as well as dual-peak spectral shapes where the spacing of the peaks can be varied. It is commonly known that adjustments in the laser spectrum must be carefully considered since exposure latitude (EL) can also be reduced as DOF is increased. By carefully engineering the laser\u2019s spectrum, DOF can be maximized with very little impact to exposure latitude. Undesirable speckle contrast can also be reduced as laser bandwidth is increased. Traditionally, these approaches have been used to improve DOF of thick resist applications such as CMOS image sensors. Other areas such as NAND Flash have introduced laser spectrum engineering (SE) to compensate for topography effects between periphery and array regions. Recently, advances in laser hardware have enabled new and unique spectral shapes to be used for imaging. In this paper, we explore the various spectral profiles possible on the latest Gigaphoton GT66A ArFi light sources. New applications of these spectrum shapes are considered for foundry logic-type levels. First, a representative 14nm-node logic layer is considered. Source Mask Optimization (SMO) is performed while various widths of spectral profiles are used as input, such as traditional E95 Gaussian profiles, dual-peak, and flat top. By accounting for the laser spectrum during SMO, common DOF can be improved by \u2265 20% without a noticeable decrease in exposure latitude. The SMO sources and optimized masks are also different from each other and the nominal cases, depending on the spectral distribution used. Next, we explore simultaneously optimizing the laser spectrum, source, and mask in an experimental SMO+SE. Spectra can be constrained to keep symmetric profiles about the 193nm center point. Improved lithographic performance can result from the application of programmable laser spectra combined with pixelated sources and inverse lithography (ILT).", "Ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a simple contact process that is attractive and promising process for high pattern fidelity, without blurring effect due to light scattering or acid diffusion in the resist. Specifically, complicated 3D patterns, fine 2D patterns, and fine 1D patterns can be formed in fewer process steps compared to those for optical lithography. On the other hand, there are fewer adjustment knobs for process tuning in NIL; therefore, it is necessary to introduce design restrictions customized for NIL to improve the process margin. Since pattern transfer is performed through filling of a resist having a finite volume, a design constraint considering filling property is required to reduce defect density and improve throughput. In this study, two types of design constraints are examined to address the NIL process margin problem. One is a NIL alignment mark design that satisfies both signal strength and filling characteristics. The other is a combination of the pattern coverage rule with wafer topography that achieves good filling characteristics under various substrate unevenness conditions. Experiment results were interpolated with NIL process simulations and common areas under various conditions were extracted to identify the design rules for achieving large process margins. By using a design flow that considers these rules, we believe that high volume manufacturing (HVM) yields can be increased considerably by reducing yield issues and reducing redesign loops.", "Curvilinear design layout is becoming increasingly prevalent in semiconductor manufacturing industry. One of the applications is Silicon Photonics. Silicon Photonics design layout requires the use of curvilinear shapes to minimize the loss of signal strength. Other applications include curvilinear Mask Proximity Correction (CL MPC), verification (CL MPCV), Mask Rule Checking (CL MRC), microelectromechanical system (MEMS), on-chip metasurface optics, etc. Curvilinear design layout poses new challenges to computational lithography tools that were developed mainly to handle Manhattan geometries. It has been found that the geometry-based error classification used in the Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) verification flow has its limitations to support curvilinear designs. In this paper, we present our innovative work of using Siemens EDA Calibre\u00ae OPCVerify Machine Learning (ML) Classify technology to classify error markers in the feature vector space instead of traditional pattern\u2019s vertices and edges geometries. There are five steps in our OPCVerify ML Classify: 1. use primary checks to output error markers, 2. design features and create feature vector kernels, 3. collect feature vectors at error marker locations, 4. prepare patterns with pre-knowledge of desired classify guidance and train ML model, and 5. apply ML classify model to classify error markers on full layout in the feature vector space. In our experiments, ML Classify is successful in classifying OPC verification error markers in curvilinear designs. A drawn silicon photonics layout with 837,072 raw error locations has demonstrated our ML Classify tool\u2019s capability to reduce the unique class count from 221,085 based on conventional geometry-based classify approach down to 51. We also developed further sub-classify feature which provides options to further sub-classify results by edge types, convex, concave, or straight line, and by polygon\u2019s internal width and external space to neighboring polygons. The 51 unique class count becomes 2493 after the further sub-classify process. This methodology is not only good for silicon photonics application, but also good for other curvilinear photomask applications, like CL MPCV, MEMS, on-chip metasurface optics, and in general even Manhattan designs.", "NAND flash memory is widely used as the primary storage medium with the development of IT technology. In order to increase the memory density and reduce cost per bit, Vertical-NAND (VNAND) technology has attracted attention. In VNAND technology, the cell array is formed in a vertical direction by stacking the multiple multi oxide/nitride layer deposition (MOLD) layer. As the number of stacked layer (Word-Line) is increased, however, several technical issues have been encountered such as miss-alignment between stacked layers, which is caused by MOLD shrinkage in memory process like etching and anneal. The mis-alignment leads to the bridge between word-line cut (WL-CUT) and channel hole (Ch. Hole), it causes a major failure in cell region. In present study, we proposed a novel automated system called Progressive Mis-Align Correction system (PMAC), which compensates for the systematic defect caused by misalignment between stacked layers. We also introduced a modelling method to estimate the degree of mis-align in unsampled regions using Random forest machine learning algorithm. In order to evaluate the performance, we applied the PMAC system to WL-CUT layer of 170-layer NAND product. We compared the turnaround time (TAT) and accuracy of PMAC system and the way of manual correction. We confirmed that the proposed system using a tool that has correction technology for each shape effectively reduced the turnaround time by up to 90% (14d to 2d) and the error of correction by up to 0.3nm. These results suggest that the PMAC system could improve the productivity.", "The throughput of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is a key factor in the cost of ownership of EUVL patterning at advanced nodes, and low dose exposure is a direct way to increase the wafer throughput. However, low dose exposure typically leads to poor CD uniformity and line-width roughness. In the paper, we investigate low dose EUV exposure via design and mask optimization, and experimentally show the methodology to achieve low dose EUV exposure while maintaining the process performance. The impact of mask CD bias, mask stack and the tonality on the exposure dose and the process performance will be discussed, together with the design retarget and OPC strategy.", "According to the Power-Performance-Area requirements in advanced technology node, we already scaled down poly pitch (CPP) and metal pitch (MP) which considered as main factors to form standard cell (SDC) area. However, in recent technology nodes, the scaling of CPP and MP started to slow down, due to the physical limitation. To continue to meet the requirements, combined with Design-Technology co-optimization (DTCO), the height of standard cell would become the main factor here, which we could reduce it by reducing the number of tracks. In this paper, we would introduce 3DIC as one of the design options for 2nm node to keep scaling by reducing the cell height with its specific 3D structure and inserted booster. Also, we would introduce the coming challenges as importing 3D-IC to 2nm technology node.", "We explore in this study imaging performance of horizontally oriented logic metal layer designs computationally, focusing on metal patterns with a pitch of 20nm (P20) and a tip-to-tip (T2T) range of 8- 35nm using 0.55 NA EUV single exposure. Simulations are performed by the method of source-mask optimization (SMO) using the TachyonTM software. The key assessed imaging parameters include the (normalized) image log-slope (NILS/ILS), overlapping depth of focus (DOF), and best focus (BF) shift. Simulation results show that traditional TaBN masks offer a reasonable overall contrast and DOF of both dense lines and through-pitch line patterns. Low-n masks offer benefits in contrast and dose. Low-n masks also show improvement in BF shift range, but such benefits vary with the extinction coefficient k as well as the pitch range and pattern selections. Other resolution enhancement techniques such as subresolution assistant features (SRAF) and bright-field imaging associated with metal-oxide-resists (MOR) also provide help to improve patterning performance. Metal designs with thick power rails have an impact on the contrast of neighboring patterns. Inner SRAF OPC and narrow power rails can effectively eliminate this impact. Patternable T2T size is type-dependent. Our study finds a flat ILS when T2T size is \u226515nm (for P20 lines) and a quick ILS drop when T2T size is < 15nm. It also reveals that complex T2T designs (e.g. staggered T2Ts) have lower contrasts. Additional care is needed in OPC other than avoiding such patterns in design. Our study confirms the potential replacement of 0.33 NA 3- to 4-time multipatterning by 0.55 NA single patterning.", "Source mask optimization (SMO) is one of the most widely employed techniques at 7nm technology nodes. As new lithography techniques develop, lithography metrics of SMO used in cost functions (CF) are also developing quickly. Besides the standard critical dimension (CD) and edge placement error metrics, image log-slope (ILS) and ILS-DOF are also significant, which are penalties in SMO CF. A novel contrast-aware SMO is proposed in this paper to improve ILS in current edge placement error (EPE) based SMO flow. The target ILS, an appropriate penalty weight and the cutlines which should be applied the specific process window metric should be adjusted in several SMO iterations. The corresponding mask optimization results based on the qualified SMO model may provide a qualified retargeting strategy at the same time.", "For 28 nm node semiconductor devices and beyond, more aggressive resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) such as sub-resolution assist features (SRAF), litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE), self-aligned double patterning (SADP), self-aligned quadruple patterning(SAQP), and source-mask optimization (SMO) are utilized for the low k1 factor lithography processes. The litho-to-etch pattern fidelity is extremely critical since a slight lithography pattern weakness (ex: photoresist (PR) thickness loss, profile roughness ...) may be worsened after etch process due to the pattern loading effect, which will then induce physical defects that affect the final electrical performance. Rigorous lithography simulation can provide a reference of pattern weaknesses to modify mask layouts; but it is incapable of full-field mask data preparation. The post-etch critical dimensions (CDs) with a high accuracy optical proximity correction (OPC) model has become an important component; but it requires massive wafer data of post-litho and post-etch CDs, and will increase the runtime of the OPC flow for OPC modelers. In our previous submission [1-2], we had brought forth an algorithm that utilizes multi-intensity levels from conventional aerial image simulations to assess the physical profile through lithography to etch steps, and proposed a novel litho-etch correction method without suffering the lithography process window of SADP process. In this paper, we have improved this methodology and introduced a new approach of virtual etch target (VET) with virtual etch target threshold to assess post-etch CDs for various applications of memory patterning (dense features by SADP or SAQP process) and logic patterning (random features of lines, trenches and holes) more efficiently. The results not only matched post-etch wafer data, but also agreed with post-etch process window. Furthermore, this methodology can be utilized in generic OPC and post-OPC verification procedures to improve final pattern fidelity for logic and memory products.", "Source Mask Optimization (SMO), which enables complex design geometries and improves lithography process window, is a key technology utilized in our hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturing. In this co-optimization technique, mask optimization has been extensively explored and well established in our community. However, source optimization of equal importance receives less attention even with a long history of development since 90s. In the source optimization, the light intensity from a source is generally perceived as a linear addition of intensity from each point source based on Abbe\u2019s method. The drawback on this common approach is that the computation is intensive and timeconsuming as it involves the convolution between the pupil function modulated by each point source and the input mask. Here we present an algorithm of calculating transmission cross coefficients (TCC) for each point source in an illumination source. By following the Hopkins\u2019s approach, the source TCC matrix can be interpreted as the summation of individual TCCs of point sources. Compared to the Abbe\u2019s source formulation, the proposed algorithm provides a simpler, faster and accurate source representation, which is believed to be beneficial to the source mask optimization.", "This work is evaluating Machine Learning (ML) architecture options for weak point detection methods embedded in Design for Manufacturing (DFM) signoff tools. As Deep Learning based models have been released into the customer design enablement space, we are investigating the tradeoffs between model simplicity, run time and prediction accuracy. With simpler model architectures, additional options for data augmentation become available that can potentially result in better model accuracy. For example, noise introduction in the training data set can help prevent overfitting and thus results in better model accuracy.", "Design rules are geometric constraints imposed on IC layout to ensure products can be manufactured at an acceptable yield. Designs are required to pass sign-off design rule check (DRC) before tape-out. Foundries rely on DRC to ensure designs they accept are manufacturable. DRC runsets must be accurate, complete, and reliable. DRC runset qualification is critical in technology node deployment and maturation. The number, complexity and variation of design rules grow dramatically with advancing technology nodes. This increases the QA challenge to ensure quality and accuracy of runsets and their interdependent rule operations. Traditional methods of migrating previous node QA patterns, manually crafting new testcases, and targeted-pattern generation leave gaps in advanced process node qualification coverage. We deploy a novel synthetic layout generation approach to produce large varieties of complex layouts with high design space coverage to thoroughly qualify runsets, make runset improvements and release quality PDKs. We employ guided random Monte Carlo layout generation with user-defined layout construction rules. User-defined rules inform DRC requirements and assign weighted priorities to guide layout design styles. We generate stress DR layouts and high pattern coverage, with DRC-clean patterns and with deliberate DRC violations, to validate expected DRC results and exercise entire rule decks. In this paper, we show how Synthetic Layout Generation is integrated into runset QA flows, automatically generating stress DR conditions that manual efforts often miss, expand layout pattern space coverage, and improve runset execution coverage leading to higher quality on-time PDK development, qualification, and release.", "Diversity of known hotspot patterns is important for hotspot detection and correction. Deliberate synthesis of hotspot patterns can improve such diversity. Machine learning generative network is a popular tool for image synthesis, but it should be trained with known hotspots anyway. We propose U-net hotspot generator. A key is to train the generator with CNN hotspot probability model, i.e. the generator is trained such that output is a variant of input image with high hotspot probability. The method allows any patterns, even coldspots, to be provided to the generator, which then yields their hotspot variants. Efficiency of hotspot generator is demonstrated through experiments.", "In this paper, we are presenting a smart and efficient methodology to select the most representative patterns on the wafer. Calibre-SONR is doing Smart down-sampling to patterns on the wafer based on their features and choose the most representative ones to be used in different applications. In addition, it gives the user the flexibility to choose the range of needed representative patterns to tune their models on. A comparison between SONR down-sampling and typical offthe- shelf down-sampling and clustering techniques is done. SONR gives better coverage to the unique patterns than other techniques and able to handle larger data sets.", "This paper demonstrates a new approach for hotspot detection in large design spaces. We present a new pattern matching technique, which is a multi-window pattern search that is deployed in a dynamic and precise way to search for similar patterns. Based on the matched locations the flow extracts and combines silicon awareness features and design level features to build comprehensive feature matrix that can be used in subsequent analytical analysis. The paper also shows the advantage of using this flow with respect to precise capture of hotspot and ~10X improvement on turnaround time for feature extraction compared with traditional methods. The output of this flow also facilitates and improves the data preparation process for machine learning model building.", "MB-OPC contains a fragmentation step, in which each polygon edge is divided into a number of segments. Simple empirical rules dictate how the edges should be divided. Fragmentation strongly affects MB-OPC in its quality and runtime since OPC correction is performed segment by segment. Refragmentation using random forest classifier (RFC) is proposed. A segment and its surroundings are modeled using a number of features, which drive RFC to decide whether a segment should be further divided or not. It complements rule-based fragmentation in that small number of critical segments, which are not short enough and cause longer MB-OPC iterations, are quickly identified. When refragmentation is applied in standard rule-based fragmentation and MB-OPC flow, maximum EPE is reduced substantially (from 3.8nm to 2.4nm) with very marginal increase in the number of segments (7k to 7,093), yet OPC iterations are reduced (10 down to 8).", "Data augmentation is a powerful technique in deep learning to increase the number of training data by using limited original data. We apply this technique to EUV lithography simulation based on convolutional neural network (CNN). In previous work, we developed a prototype CNN which reproduces the results of the rigorous electromagnetic (EM) simulations in a small mask area. The prediction time of CNN was 5,000 times faster than the calculation time of EM simulation. We trained the CNN by using 200,000 data which were the results of EM simulation. Although the prediction time of CNN was very short, it took a long time to build a huge amount of the training data. Especially when we enlarge the mask area the calculation time to prepare the training data becomes unacceptably long. The EM calculation time for 1,024 nm X 1,024 nm mask area takes 162 s. It will take a year to calculate 200,000 mask patterns. The training data of our CNN is the diffraction amplitudes of mask patterns. Assuming a periodic boundary condition, the diffraction amplitudes of the shifted or flipped mask pattern can be easily calculated by using the diffraction amplitudes of the original mask pattern. We apply this data augmentation technique to reduce the data preparation time for 1,024 nm X 1,024 nm mask area by a factor of 200. The accuracy of CNN is verified by comparing the CNN predictions with the results of EM simulation. Our CNN successfully reproduces critical dimensions and edge placement errors of line and space patterns.", "Subresolution assist feature (SRAF) insertion is an effective way to improve the printability and lithographic process window of isolated and semi-isolated features. State-of-the-art works resort to machine learning to reduce the computational cost associated with model-based methods. However, the result of SRAF probability learning, a probability map, cannot be directly treated as SRAFs. Inserting an SRAF to each layout grid predicted as 1 leads to design rule violations. Therefore, the SRAF probability learning model can only guide SRAF insertion and needs special handling to place SRAFs. For SRAF placement, we observe that placing SRAFs at probability maxima might be too greedy so that the SRAF prediction is masked to a certain extent. Therefore, we propose a novel methodology for SRAF placement over a machine learning generated probability map. First, a clustering-based method generates an initial SRAF inserted layout based on the given probability map. Then, a two-stage SRAF legalization strategy modifies the positions of SRAFs to be compliant with design rules. Experimental results show that given a probability map, our methodology can generate an SRAF inserted layout which guarantees design rule violation freeness while maintaining competitive PV band and EPE.", "Matrix-OPC is used to mathematically derive mask bias using mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) matrix. Since MEEF denotes the edge placement error (EPE) change of segment induced by unit mask bias of its neighbor segment, exact MEEF calculation requires lithography simulation before and after perturbing neighbor segments. Therefore, MEEF calculation is a computationally expensive process, which leads to matrix-OPC being applied to only some critical regions in a layout. We propose fast MEEF prediction using an artificial neural network (ANN). MEEF represents the effect of one segment on another, so polar Fourier transform signals extracted from both segments are used as input of ANN. Also, the distance between two segments and the direction of each segment is used as input of ANN. Predicted MEEFs are used to construct MEEF matrices and matrix-OPC is used to derive mask biases. Experimental results show that proposed MEEF prediction is 3.7 times faster than exact MEEF calculation, thus matrix-OPC with predicted MEEFs is 30% faster than matrix-OPC with exact MEEFs.", "With the algorithmic breakthroughs in machine learning, increasingly more applications have been developed for computational lithography. In this paper, a pixelated mask synthesis method including After Development Inspection (ADI) contour and mask feature generation, was proposed by utilizing deep learning technique. Two Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were constructed, the first network was for mask to contour prediction, and the consecutive network was to perform design to mask correction. A pix2pix model was first trained to learn the correspondences between mask image and paired ADI contour image collected on wafer, thus the capability of printing prediction can be established. The well trained mask-to-contour model was then implemented as the simulator component of machine learning mask correction (ML-OPC) framework. Next, another unsupervised GAN formed the front-end of ML-OPC framework to synthesize mask patterns from any given design layout. Generated mask patterns were eventually optimized through minimizing pixel difference between design target and corresponding contour generated by mask-to-contour model. The experimental results demonstrated that our ML-OPC framework can mimic conventional OPC model to produce exquisite mask patterns and contours.", "The goal of this study is to discuss the findings of experiments we conducted to enhance defect capture rate in the advanced nodes design-for-manufacturing flow. As a metric of manufacturing excellence, wafer fabrication units track and report defect density on a regular basis. Fabrication with a reduced defect density can produce a higher chip yield. In recent years, systematic defects resulting from design and process have been predicted to be the leading cause of yield loss. This could result in a large rise in manufacturing costs and time. As a result, they are highly undesirable, and it is critical to accurately identify them for root analysis of weak patterns. Unlike random process defects, systematic patterning defects may show characteristic design features and our goal is to leverage these to create a machine learning model that can efficiently identify and categorize these defects before they get into production. An inherent problem that we face is class imbalance: high confidence defect data constitutes a few thousand samples for maturing nodes and nondefects of the order of millions. Additionally, millions of records in the train, test, and inference datasets, even with reduced feature sets, can lead to a host of big data issues like insufficient memory, large experiment times, and lack of integrated development. In this paper, we discuss methodologies to handle the large volume, imbalanced data which led to 47% improvement in the defect capture and 100% improvement in the noise to signal ratio.", "Retargeting-aware Design for Manufacturability (DFM) via-metal enclosure checks are developed using supervised machine learning to identify critical weak points to aid layout fixing. The machine learning model is developed using a neutral network architecture. Seventeen localized layout features were extracted, including: side and line end via-metal enclosure, via spacing to the neighboring features, and metal coloring. The extracted features were used to form feature vectors to train and generate a machine learning-based model for predicting post-retargeting, via-metal enclosures. This method was demonstrated on 22nm layouts. Using a neural network with 2-hidden layers, the predicted via-metal enclosure versus the actual data correlate with an R2 of 0.91 and an RMSE 0.0067.", "The Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) variation on a die is a function of the die\u2019s location on the wafer. For example, the post CMP thickness and/or topography variations in the center die can be very different from those in the mid-radius and edge dies. Consequently, the number of CMP hotspots and the hotspot locations can vary from die-to-die on a given wafer. Most commercial CMP simulation tools in the Design for Manufacturing (DFM) field focus on predicting CMP topography and thicknesses for a single die on the patterned wafer, and do not have wafer level prediction capabilities. For CMP simulation to be more effective in process and layout optimization, CMP simulation tools should be able to accurately predict CMP performance at the feature-scale, within the die, and across the entire wafer. In this paper, we analyze CMP data from multiple dies on back end of line (BEOL) Cu interconnect levels and show the wafer level effects in a polishing process. We use the data to calibrate Cadence\u2019s integrated wafer level and die level CMP models and use the calibrated models to predict the CMP pattern dependencies on multiple dies across a product chip wafer. Finally, we show a comparison of the simulation to measured data.", "Automated image analysis and image classification system that employs machine learning has been developed and applied to the PWQ/FEM flow to enhance the Process Stability Diagnosis (PSD) solution, which can now handle a significant volume of wafer images while realizing a 4X reduction in time to results. Moving the task of image analysis and classification to the computer has the added benefit of avoiding person-to-person inconsistencies in classification. The data flow consists of an automated machine learning-enabled process window analysis system that relies on CDSEM images taken on a FEM or Focus/Exposure Matrix wafer. We report results based on CDSEM images containing both contact hole and line features. The system enables full-wafer SEM image auto-classification and process window characterization.", "With the technology node scaling to 5 nm, the forbidden pitch effect caused by destructive interaction between main feature and neighboring feature always leads to poor process window. Due to the small critical dimension (CD) and pitch of these features, forbidden pitches (FPs) become more sensitive in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Therefore, controlling of FPs are becoming more and more critical. With the purpose of providing a strategy of mitigating the negative effect of forbidden pitch, an optimization method of the mask structure is developed in this paper. For illustration, three optimal mask structures under quasar illumination conditions are given by the optimized method. The performances of these three structures are demonstrated by the numerical lithography simulator S-litho. The effectiveness and validity of the proposed method are demonstrated from above simulation results. Therefore, the mask structure provided by the optimized method has the potential to be an efficient candidate for mitigating the negative effect of forbidden pitch structure.", "In the mask data preparation (MDP) flow, it is necessary to verify that layout structures are correctly placed and that specific critical dimensions (CDs) are correct. Certain layout versions of Electrical Test (ETest) structures are placed throughout various locations of the frame data which will be sent for fracture and mask production. Within each ETest structure, there are many sub-structures and gauge points where we want to verify dimensions and locations in the post fractured data. The current preparation flow being employed is error-prone and time-consuming, considering that the entire verification process is done manually. To address this issue, we have utilized a novel pattern search methodology that can measure and report gauge locations relative to unique identifier pattern locations which can all be reviewed graphically on the actual mask data. A full inspection point kit is first generated by a developer using automation scripts which allow graphical gauge definitions relative to a unique identifier pattern per ETest location. A revision-controlled pattern library is created to define the test patterns to be measured based on the technology product. A user can then take this kit and run all post-fracture reporting of ETest structures per tape-out. Correspondence with the mask shop is also simplified and discrepancies are easily verified. In this paper, we will discuss in greater detail how this pattern-based approach and the utilization of pattern libraries help us in significantly reducing the possible errors and verification time. We will also review how the entire process which includes the location measurement and the reporting structure to the mask shop can be fully automated, hence, improving the productivity and the turn-around-time for the mask manufacturing process.", "Forbidden pitches (FPs) effect is directly related to the loss of process window, which is caused by the difference of diffraction orders of patterns in some pitches. This paper analyzes the FPs effects in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography based on the rigorous imaging simulation and process window evaluation. In the rigorous simulation, S-litho is used to analyze the normalized image log slope of test patterns from critical layer, which allow us to find the weak pitches. Then, the process windows of these test patterns are evaluated using the lithography simulator Proteus WorkBench. This can find out the accurate FPs from the range of weak pitches. Finally, the strategy of mitigating the negative effect of FPs is proposed with the help of source optimization. Unlike deep ultraviolet lithography, the difference of FPs between vertical and horizontal direction is presented in the paper. The simulation results have effectively been used design rules.", "As critical dimension (CD) shrinks, the spec of CD uniformity (CDU) is getting tighter. To ensure CDU requirement, OPC team is making great efforts on etch proximity correction (EPC) than ever. For a long time, EPC only considers aperture effect which is usually simplified as a width and space rule table. However, astechnical nodes ever-shrinking, microloading effect plays a much more import role than aperture effect and rule table is not suitable any more. As in microloading effect pattern density is the key factor, we studied the density effect on dense array patterns with fixed CD and pitch in this paper. Firstly we designed a series of test pattern for calibrating an etch model, then we refined a simplified density rule table from the good fit (R2 >0.94) etch model. Contrast to traditional width/space rule table and complicated etch model, this approach is convenient and effective on dense array patterns EPC.", "Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is one of the most important techniques in improving the resolution and pattern fidelity of optical lithography in the semiconductor industry. As the feature sizes and the process margin in nanometer technology become smaller, OPC models also need to be more accurate. However, improving the model accuracy often requires collecting more SEM data, which in turn results in a longer time for the entire flow. Therefore, an efficient method that can improve the accuracy of the OPC model while reducing the data collection time is crucial. Furthermore, machine learning has recently been applied to the lithography optimizations with some success, so it will be a useful technique to further optimize gauge sampling. This paper proposes an efficient OPC model gauge sampling flow using machine learning methods through data preprocessing, feature transformation and clustering to divide sample data into clusters and select a small amount of representative sample data from them to calibrate the model, achieving the same effect as using all data to calibrate. In order to test and verify the proposed approach, we use various types of patterns including line-space, contact hole, etc., to verify our results. By optimizing the gauge sampling flow, we can reduce the gauge requirements and modeling run time without sacrificing the accuracy and stability of the model.", "Beyond the 40nm technology node, layout weak points and hotspot types increase dramatically. Many hotspots can be detected by OPC simulation. However, in advanced nodes, OPC simulation suffers from a long turn-around-time (TAT) and is challenged to handle the additional design complexity. Therefore, in order to speed up the process and OPC development, an efficient OPC hotspot detection method is required. This paper presents a flow using Pegasus Computational Pattern Analytics (CPA) technology from Cadence to extract a comprehensive set of patterns to build a pattern bank from a layout source. We can then compare two or more different banks (diffing) to find new patterns which have not been processed before. OPC engineers can analyze these new patterns to check for any OPC issues instead of simulating a full chip. This flow provides a much higher efficiency and better performance while allowing the storage of pattern banks over time to build history and yield experience. Over time, each new layout introduced for OPC can be processed faster because more patterns have been added to the banks and less simulation time is needed.", "Today, we are at the dawn of the 5th disruptive innovation wave. This emerging fifth wave, the deeptech wave, builds on the convergence of technologies such as AI, material science, biology, semiconductors \u2026 to disrupt virtually every aspect of the physical world we live in. Semiconductors will be the core of many deeptech innovations thanks to their massive integration power, accessible mass production and low cost. To enable these deeptech innovations, Moore\u2019s law will have to continue to address insatiable demands for more computation and more storage. We will realize Moore\u2019s law by a multitude of approaches: continue traditional scaling, new devices, new switches, leverage the use of the third dimension, and paradigm shifts on how to build future systems. The challenges to bring these innovations to the market are huge. Therefore, we will have to approach this evolution through a major ecosystem, bringing together the right companies, the right R&D resources, perform this in leading-edge infrastructure, with the right funding and government support.", "The semiconductor industry has been extremely successful in integrating discrete components into billion-transistor chips. Future electronic systems will continue to rely on, and increasingly benefit from, the advances in semiconductor technology as they have had for more than five decades. Applications such as AI, machine learning, 5G, and even quantum computing, will not fulfill their promises without the continual advancements of semiconductor technology that is anticipated. Advancement of lithography has always been viewed as one of the most important, if not the most important, technologies that enables generations after generations of semiconductor technologies. With EUV and the upcoming high NA tools, it appears that there will be enough patterning resolution to pattern anything we want, unless we need to carve individual atoms. What is the future of lithography? What problems can lithography solve for the semiconductor industry? I will present industry and technology trends as a seed corn for discussion.", "Quantum computing is the grand challenge of the 21st century and is poised to revolutionizes our daily lives on a nearly unfathomable level. To truly understand the impact, we must first build a universal, fully error corrected machine capable of exploring the application space envisioned by both academic and industry. Numerous pathways have been identified and demonstrated to fabricate single, unique qubits using a myriad of platforms (superconducting, ions, nanoparticles, photons, etc\u2026). However, it is now widely accepted that a truly useful quantum computer will require millions of interconnected, identical qubits to perform fully error corrected, general purpose calculations. To that end, photon-based qubits offer a path to such a general-purpose machine by leveraging the mature silicon photonics high-volume manufacturing ecosystem. Creating quantum devices from silicon photonics components requires patterning innovation to bring leading-edge nanolithography to near macroscopic scale, a unique challenge for an industry where the future relies on progressive device shrink.", "A new generation of metrology tools has been recently released to the market, allowing extensive characterization of semiconductor samples thanks to massive measurements. The resulting substantial growth of measurement sets in size and number of descriptors made the data analysis with the traditional statistical techniques laborious, being unable to consider all data simultaneously. In this work, we propose an analysis method applicable to the massive measurement sets based on a machine learning technique, called Autoencoder (AE). The performance of the original AE model has been boosted in this work thanks to its regularization, by imposing orthogonality of its internal representation and by training only half of the model weights while the second half is deduced. Practically, once the model is trained on the data set of interest, it is used to study relationships between input variables through the chart of the circle of correlations. In this chart, input variables are projected as vectors into the compression plane where the angular distance between them will express their degree of correlation. The representation of massive measurements data through a condensed simple chart that still shows complex interactions between variables is in fact very efficient and facilitating the interpretation of measurements themselves. The experimental validation of the proposed method has been done with measurements of Contact Hole (CH) patterns acquired on samples manufactured with 3 different exposure conditions (underexposure dose, nominal exposure dose, and overexposure dose). The proposed data analysis technique allowed us to clearly identify the impact of the process conditions on patterns characteristics, such as their eccentricity, their geometry, and more. Our results indicated that in case of overexposure, an anisotropic distortion of the CH geometry is present, where \ud835\udc4c-axis is the major axis, with larger impact on the pattern surface as compared to the \ud835\udc4b-axis. This result has been also confirmed later through defect inspection, where we found that 94% of bridging defects detected occurred along the \ud835\udc4c-axis, while only 6% of bridging occurred along the \ud835\udc4b-axis. In conclusion, our results indicated that the proposed analysis technique is highly effective for the analysis and interpretation of massive metrology datasets, and that the dimensionality increase of the dataset has a negligible impact on this technique's performance.", "In the domain of advanced patterning, and especially at lithography steps achieve very small sizes becomes more and more crucial. This induces measurement challenges and thus requiring the development of new, precise and robust metrology techniques. To overcome the limited constraints of different techniques, one of the most promising approaches is hybrid metrology. It consists in gathering several metrology techniques to measure all the geometrical parameters which are processed them by an algorithm (mainly machine learning algorithm). This work stands out by using for deep learning a multi-branch neural network to increase the precision of predicts. With a particular attention made to the dataset generation and specific settings for each branch, we developed the potential of this approach which increase the precision of predicts.", "In case the process margin of the device is large and the defect tendency in the wafer occurs randomly, process monitoring were possible using limited sampling measurement values. Previous 3D structure metrology equipment (CD-SEM, ellipsometry, etc.) are not able to measure the entire structure of the wafer due to the speed limit. If the measurement location does not include a weak point, an error occurs in predicting the wafer defect rate. In this study, we propose a new method that can extract weak points from color maps obtained by high-speed inspection tools that can measure the entire wafer. We were able to reduce the process error by about 20% by weak point monitoring.", "The flatness of the silicon wafers used to manufacture integrated circuits (IC) is controlled to tight tolerances to help ensure that the full wafer is sufficiently flat for lithographic processing1. Chemical-Mechanical Planarization (CMP) is one of many processes outside the lithographic sector that will influence wafer flatness across each image lithographic exposure section field and across the wafer2. Advanced lithographic patterning processes require a detailed map of the wafer shape to avoid overlay errors caused by depth-of-focus issues1. In recent years, a metrology tool named PWG5TM (Patterned Wafer Geometry, 5th generation), based on using double Fizeau interferometry to generate phase changes from the interferometric pattern applied to the reflective surface, has been used to generate a wafer geometry map to correct for process induced focus issues as well as overlay problems2. In this paper we present Wave Front Phase Imaging (WFPI); a new patterned wafer geometry technique that measures the wave front phase utilizing two intensity images of the light reflected off the patterned wafer. We show that the 300mm machine acquires 7.65 million data points in 5 seconds on the full 300mm patterned wafer with a lateral resolution of 96\u03bcm.", "The semiconductor industry needs to fit ever more devices per unit area to improve their performance; hence a trend towards increasingly complex structures by varying material combinations and 3D geometries with increasing aspect ratios. The new materials used may be optically opaque, posing problems for traditional optical metrology methods. One solution is to use acoustical waves, which present the double advantage of not being hampered by optically opaque layers and allowing for penetration depths of 10\u2019s of \u03bcm at sub-\u03bcm wavelengths; which is considerably larger than most traditional optical methods (O(100 nm\u2019s - \u03bcm\u2019s)). Here, we present a novel acoustic metrology method using GHz ultrasound waves to measure deeply buried subsurface features (<5 \u03bcm). The concept consisted of a GHz acoustic transducer integrated above the tip of a custom designed probe, which is then scanned across a sample. The method uses non-damaging solid-solid contact without the need for liquid coupling layers \u2013 in contrast to conventional acoustical microscopy. This allows for the use of much higher acoustic frequencies, hence higher on-axis resolutions. The transducer is used in pulse-echo mode and a stage controller is used to move the probe for scanning. An experimental setup was built with a 4 GHz transducer and tested successfully on 1.5-2 \u03bcm size features buried below a 5 \u03bcm PMMA or 10 \u03bcm SiO2 layer, respectively. A good match was further obtained between the measurements and the model predictions. These results demonstrated the feasibility of the new method, opening new opportunities for metrology and inspection applications.", "We report on enhanced detection of strain waves in gold gratings, using a probe laser pulse tuned at and close to the surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) resonance of the gratings. The enhancement, of up to twenty times, is observed in the strain-wave-induced reaction changes and depends on the type of acoustic wave. For the surface acoustic wave, the enhancement of the optical reaction is greatest at the peak of the resonance, while strain-wave-induced reaction changes of other types of strain waves show their strongest enhancement when the probe pulse is tuned to the wings of the SPP resonance.", "In the past decade, EUV lithography has rapidly evolved, and has finally been acknowledged as a requirement for continued scaling. While there have been many improvements on the scanner side to improve resolution, throughput and performance, metrology and characterization have also played a significant role in enabling process maturity and yield. Now, an EUV process owner\u2019s toolbox contains infrastructure and methodology for stochastics-aware process window analysis (SA-PWA), and the subsequent data is a keystone for process transfer to high-volume manufacturing (HVM). However, the monitoring, metrology and analysis needed for SA-PWA is oftentimes at odds with the throughput metrics for HVM. At first, methods for detecting stochastic failures were developed by pushing existing tooling, such as critical dimension scanning electron microscopy (CDSEM), e-beam inspection (EBI) and Brightfield inspection (BFI), outside of its comfort zone to find these nanosized defects at sub-36nm pitch. On one hand, application of these methods improved yield at aggressive sub-36nm pitches. On the other hand, inspections are on the order of hours per wafer or days and the data requires rigorous manual analysis. There are some compromises to improve SA-PWA without sacrificing improvements to yield, but eventually throughput will plateau and become the rate-limiting step in an EUV process development cycle. Continued improvement requires innovative development of next-generation metrology tooling and software components for data analysis, and simplified, or better yet automated, SA-PWA.", "Background: Focus-exposure process window measurement and analysis is an essential function in lithography, but the current geometric approach suffers from several significant deficiencies. Aim: By clearly identifying the problems with the Geometric Process Window approach, a new process window measurement and analysis method will be proposed to address these problems. Approach: The Probabilistic Process Window proposed here takes metrology uncertainty into account and rigorously calculates the expected fraction of in-spec features based on settings for best dose/focus and presumed random errors in dose and focus. Using the fraction of in-spec features thus calculated, a much more rigorous determination of the trade-off between exposure latitude and depth of focus can be performed. Results: The Probabilistic Process Window approach is demonstrated on focus-exposure data generated from a standard extreme ultraviolet lithography process at three different pitches, showing the value of this method. Conclusions: The new Probabilistic Process Window approach offers clear advantages in accuracy for both depth of focus determination and best dose/focus determination. Consequently, its use is preferred both for process development applications and high-volume manufacturing.", "Background: Stochastic effects stated as the ultimate limit of EUV lithography are widely studied by resist suppliers, mask and metrology tool fabricants. Aim: Although the phenomenon is less explicitly visible, we want to highlight its presence in DUV through variabilities in critical dimension (CD), in shape and in position. These manifestations are not yield killers but may become reliability killers, if combined with some local overlay. Approach: Contour extractions are done from CD-SEM images to enable in-depth computational analysis of the data, to characterize local variabilities, alternatively to massive metrology solutions. This augmented computational metrology multiplies the volume of accessible CD data without requiring any supplementary tool purchasing, as they are already included within conventionally stored SEM images. Results: Contour extractions allowed to detect 5\u03c3 deviations from normal law on CD distribution from 1000 images. A set of complementary metrics quantities shape and size uniformities, as well as pattern displacement. It leads to a narrower process window where stochastic effects are minimized. Conclusion: Contour-based metrology offers complementary metrics, useful to characterize or center a process, increasing reliability by doing an extensive analysis of a fair number of CD-SEM images. Are these metrics capable of detecting early signs of process instability?", "Algorithms used for e-beam inspection and metrology need to deal with noise, blur, or other distortion sources. For metrology applications such as EUV resist patterns measurement, low electron dosage is desirable to minimize resist damage, as well as to improve turn-around time for massive metrology. However, under low dosage imaging conditions, the SEM images contain a substantial amount of noise and exhibit weak image contrast or blurry features. These factors lead to degradation of measurement precision and accuracy. Advanced image deblurring and restoration methodology becomes crucial to ensure high quality metrology performance. In this paper, we focus on a self-supervised approach to enhance SEM image quality under low dose imaging conditions. Self-supervised approach is highly desirable since it is expensive or sometimes impossible to obtain ground truth data for supervised learning. We demonstrate its capability of enhancing resolution of key features such as pattern edges while reducing the overall noise level. Comparable performance is achieved by enhancing a single frame averaged SEM image and the 4-frame averaged reference image. Performance metrics used for evaluation include CD precision, mean CD and distribution, as well as image quality metrics such as image sharpness, PSNR and SSIM.", "Microscopically, a rough surface (or any other feature) can be considered as a set of perturbations from the idealized surface. In reality, the microstructure of such a roughness may include spatial components some being smaller (subresolution) and some larger spatial frequency than the spot size of the SEM, and this should affect SE yields from such a target with respect to an ideal smooth surface. Yet to explore such influences by simulation, Monte Carlo SEM simulations are necessary but quite resource hungry, and thus somewhat limited in ability to include much fine detail, and with SEM simulation codes still being developed to include such effects easily, until now we typically simulate perfect smooth idealized structures. Other examples of such simulation resource-limited simplification of features could be etch halos at base of an etched feature, pits, bumps, craters, scratches or defects on or below the surface, CMP dishing, top corner rounding or footing at the base of a resist line or contact hole, or many other possibilities. We know these will add signatures to the simulated image, but it is important to understand how important are they to achieving realistic results.", "The aggressive reduction of semiconductor device dimensions drives many improvements in optical wafer metrology. Currently, chips with device feature sizes below 10 nm are in production which requires robust overlay metrology with sub-nm precision. We will present a compact dark-field Digital Holographic Microscope (df-DHM) that is able to measure overlay on small metrology targets from visible to infrared wavelengths. The coherent amplification and the aberration correction capabilities that is offered by df-DHM allow robust overlay metrology even on weak targets that are covered by absorbing layers. Measured data will be shown that demonstrate the capabilities of this metrology concept.", "Overlay is a critical parameter for any semi-conductor foundry, with a direct impact on the fabrication yield, on the quality, and on the performances of the product. Being able to full the overlay constraints has also a direct in influence on the capacity to scale down and to integrate vertically. In addition, the shift of semiconductor applications into more demanding markets such as spatial and automotive leads to higher specifications for the process control. In the semiconductor manufacturing, the overlay is usually measured optically using dedicated targets in the scribe lines. However, targets differ from the product by their dimensions of an order of magnitude larger and by their position up to a few millimeters far from it. This can lead to residual errors and mismatches in the correction sent to the scanner, thus lowering the fabrication yield and the global product quality. For years, many SEM in-device overlay techniques have been published, however they are generally related to new generation of SEM imaging and metrology equipment and require a new dedicated target. In our case, the ambition is to extend the usage of our current CD-SEM tool park. To do so, an on-device and target-free overlay measurement process has been developed. It is based on sub-pixel contour extractions from CD-SEM images and on the use of the design. From a single image, contours of the two layers of interest are extracted from the SEM image and a custom algorithm calculates the overlay as a difference of the realigned design centroids. This dedicated algorithm allows extracting various overlay measurements from one image and enables a production friendly implementation. To evaluate the performances of this method, it has been applied on the patterns of a SRAM with scanner-programmed overlay. The measurements are compared to the conventional optical measurements. On a basis of thousands on-device measurements, the developed method showed a promising 95% rate of successful measurements. Good correlation between the optical model and the CD-SEM measured overlay on the SRAM has been demonstrated, reaching a coefficient of correlation of 0.99 on a pattern where conventional centroid or CD based overlay are limited. Finally, the flexibility of the method to measure various patterns with an ease of recipe creation is shown. Contour-based metrology offers the capability to extract highly valuable information from SEM images while keeping the layers differentiation. The proposed measurement process, being automated and requiring relatively low human inputs is a promising solution for a SEM on device overlay metrology suitable in a high-volume manufacturing environment.", "3D heterogeneous integration is an evolving segment of the world semiconductor industry roadmap to enable improvements in device performance beyond Moore\u2019s law expectations. These \u201cMore than Moore\u201d (MtM) performance enhancements have the potential for realizing dramatic improvements in communication bandwidth, design flexibility that enables new system architectures on-chip or at the wafer level, and overall cost reduction. 3D heterogeneous integration strives to increase electrical connectivity through pitch and contact dimensional scaling to enable <10\u03bcm pitch solder bump scaling, and sub-micrometer hybrid Cu/dielectric fusion bond connectivity. Integration options include wafer to wafer (W2W), pick-and-place (P&P), and die to wafer (D2W) assembly strategies. Enhanced process capability and systems architecture imposes new overlay (OVL) metrology challenges to address variable silicon substrate thickness, stressinduced wafer or die distortions, and tight OVL error specifications. In this work, we will cover the OVL trends and challenges surrounding this evolving segment. We will cover different OVL aspects such as accuracy, measurability, reproducibility, and throughput and discuss their impact on pre and post-bonding error budgets.", "In this paper, the rAIMTM (robust AIM) overlay target was investigated in terms of the stability versus the POR AIM\u00ae (Advanced Imaging Metrology) target used for imaging-based overlay (IBO) measurement at after development inspection (ADI). The targets were designed using KLA\u2019s MTD AcuRate\u2122, metrology target design software that performs simulations based on the optical properties related to relative permittivity and permeability about the material of each of the layers. Using advanced device layers, we studied the performance of the POR AIM target versus the newly designed rAIM target for imaging-based overlay measurements. For each target, we quantified the optical contrast, kernel signal, correctable modeled terms, total measurement uncertainty (TMU), and overlay (OVL) residuals from the modeled data through various wavelengths inside the Moir\u00e9 effect regime in the case of rAIM. We demonstrate that there is an OVL measurement performance improvement using the rAIM target versus the POR AIM target. The measured optical properties of the rAIM target and comparison to the POR AIM target will be presented.", "With the advent of 45nm and below technology nodes and EUV lithography, the need to identify the chemical composition of defects is of paramount importance. The defects of concern range from 10nm to 500nm, which the current batch of molecular analytical tools cannot address adequately since the indications are that most of the defects detected on photomasks are organic in nature. In this paper, a relatively new nanoscale technique called infrared photoinduced force microscopy (IR PiFM), which combines atomic force microscopy (AFM) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy with ~ 5 nm spatial resolution, is introduced. By utilizing a state-of-the-art tunable broadband IR laser (tunable from ~550 to < 4000 cm-1 with ~ 3 cm-1 spectral width over the entire range), truly nanoscale PiF-IR spectra that agree with bulk FTIR spectra can be acquired; PiF-IR spectra can be used to search the existing IR database to unambiguously identify the different chemical species (both organic and inorganic molecules) of sub-20 nm defects and monolayer residues via their IR signatures. PiFM images at fixed wavenumbers associated with the different chemical species provide chemical mapping in real space with ~ 5 nm spatial resolution, clearly illuminating multi-component defects and existence of residues. The paper will show how the nanoscale hyperspectral PiFM data can provide unambiguous and speedy feedback to process engineers engaged in advanced lithography.", "We propose a new Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) system which consists of a dedicated electromagnet and a sensor for inspecting next generation memory, such as Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (STTMRAM). Conventional MOKE system is able to measure a magnetic hysteresis loop at a specific point by detecting the polarization rotation angle with changing the magnetic field intensity with the precision of less than 0.1deg on the reflected light. However, it takes several tens of seconds for measuring each point. We have demonstrated that inspection throughput of more than 1 wafer per hour with 2um pixel resolution can be achieved using proposed method called SCAN MOKE.", "The reflective-mode EUV mask scanning lensless imaging microscope (RESCAN) is a synchrotron-based platform dedicated to EUV mask inspection and review at the Swiss Light Source. It is based on coherent diffraction imaging (CDI), which allows retrieving both the phase and the amplitude information of the mask surface. RESCAN has been successfully tested on masks with programmed phase and amplitude defects. A metrology method that can not only detect defects and contamination, but can also determine the material of the defects, can be a powerful tool to help identify the root cause of the defects. Here, we explore the possibility of leveraging the ability of RESCAN to detect the complex amplitude of the sample to distinguish surface defects of different materials. We fabricated a sample with random logic-like absorber patterns and pillar defects on top of a Mo/Si multilayer. We show our experimental results that show the defects of different materials exhibit specific contrast and phase values. This method can be used not only to detect the masks defects but also to identify the defect materials to a limited extent.", "We present an automated application for defect detection and classification from ZEISS MultiSEM\u00ae images, based on Machine Learning (ML) technology. We acquire MultiSEM images of a semiconductor wafer suited for process window characterization at the imec iN5 logic node and use a dedicated application to train ML models for defect detection and classification. We show the user flow for training and execution, and the resulting capture and nuisance rates. Due to straightforward parallelization, the application is designed for the large amounts of data generated rapidly by the MultiSEM.", "A high-throughput e-beam monitoring strategy was developed for capturing advanced DRAM storage node (SN) defects after etching process, when high-aspect-ratio (HAR) structure is involved. With this novel approach, two types of defects, SN-bowing-short and SN-open, were captured with solid signatures. In this study, two wafers with the same structure at different technology nodes,1A and 1B, were used. To enhance the defects signal, back scattered electron (BSE) mode was used to enhance the material contrast for the bottom of HAR holes. With improved BSE image quality, SN-bowing short type was caught using defect detection based on traditional array mode detection. SN-open, however, is more challenging because of its smaller dimension and HAR, resulting in an extremely narrow detection window of image gray level difference between normal storage node hole and the defective one. In order to capture this type of defect, an die-to-database (D2DB) comparison system for e-Beam inspection was applied to address this critical defect and its wafer signature was revealed with extremely high throughput and sensitivity.", "Background: Measuring and subtracting SEM noise from a biased measurement of roughness leads to an unbiased roughness measurement. This unbiasing procedure becomes harder as the noise in the image increases. For low image signal-to-noise ratio (below about 2), unbiased roughness measurement becomes less reliable. Aim: It is important to understand the mechanism for the sensitivity of unbiased roughness accuracy to linescan signal-to-noise ratio in order to look for ways to improve unbiased roughness measurement for very noisy images. Approach: Using a combination of mathematical analysis, simulations, and experimental data, the role of pixel size and pitch in the signal-to-noise ratio sensitivity are explored. Results: All evidence points to the correlation of edge detection noise to true edge position as the cause of the errors in unbiased roughness measurement for very noisy images. For small pitch patterns, changes in feature edge position caused by feature roughness changes the linescan slope, which changes the sensitivity of edge detection to SEM image noise. Conclusions: Smaller pixel sizes and larger feature sizes are less sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio effects described here. For any algorithm used to measure unbiased roughness, the impact of linescan signal-tonoise must be carefully assessed.", "ABSTRACT The introduction of new three-dimensional (3D) architectures in future logic and memory devices present new challenges for process metrology and control. Where there is a need to recess only one material type out of a superlattice (SL) layer stack, such structures all have in common the fact that the recess is hidden in the stack. Currently, process control in this field heavily relies on expensive, slow, and destructive metrology such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). In this work, we use the high voltage Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique in combination with the Elluminator\u00ae improved Back-Scattered electrons (BSE) technology for better imaging efficiency to demonstrate the ability to measure cavity recess from top-down SEM images. We present case studies both in logic and memory domains. In Horizontal Gate-All-Around (H-GAA) Nanosheet and Forksheet logic devices, the SiGe layer is recessed in a Si/SiGe SL stack. In 3-Dimensional memory devices, we present results on Poly-Si recess metrology in Poly-Si/SiO2 SL stack, Molybdenum (Mo) recess metrology in a Mo/aSi SL stack, and TiN recess metrology in a 3DSCM stack used for memory word line. For the evaluation of the proposed recess metrology technique, several wafers with modulated recess amounts were measured using SEM technology at several high voltage landing energies (LE). BSE signal and advanced image analysis algorithms were used to build a prediction model and quantify the recessed amounts using an edge-based analysis. TEM metrology was used to validate the measurement based on the top-down high LE SEM images. We demonstrate that by using high voltage LE, in combination with enhanced BSE efficiency and advanced image analysis algorithms, we can investigate hidden layers in the stack, identify the recessed material edge, and measure accurately the cavities of interest, thus ultimately providing an inline, non-destructive, and statistically representative metrology solution for such advanced technology nodes. This new application will help chip manufacturers to characterize their processes faster and provide an HVM monitoring and control solution.", "Metrology challenges surrounding nanosheet structures used in next generation semiconductor devices based around Forksheet and Gate-All-around Field Effect Transistors include procuring measurements in the planar directions, such as critical dimensions, as well as in the vertical direction, such as sheet and recess thicknesses. Subsurface Scanning Probe Microscopy (SSPM) can be used to distinguish and measure features that are buried beneath opaque layers. In this work, we investigate if SSPM can contribute to this challenge and can be used to solve the inverse problem. It is shown that qualitative agreement between modelling and experiments is good, when the experimental contact conditions are sufficient. Quantitative measurements, however, are still out of reach.", "Over the past few years, on product overlay (OPO) challenges have become serious yield limiters for the latest technology nodes, requiring new and innovative overlay (OVL) metrology solutions. OVL metrology systems must have excellent measurability capabilities to cover as many different layers as possible, minimize any systematic contribution to measured OVL and demonstrate low residuals and high correlation to AEI SEM and AEI in die overlay (IDO). OVL metrology system manufacturers are required to introduce new target designs, tool hardware (HW) and advanced algorithms to keep up with said challenges. The paper will present optical OVL solutions per segment: foundry, logic, DRAM, and 3D NAND. We will review various new technologies developed in the last year that improve the OVL measurement systems\u2019 performance to meet the above challenges. We will see how the new innovative targets improve measurability and accuracy on imaging-based overlay (IBO) and scatterometry-based overlay (SCOL\u00ae). Then, we will review new hardware components designed to improve measurability and overall fleet matching. Lastly, we will discuss how advanced machine learning (ML), multi-wavelength (MWL) and signal-weighting algorithms improve measurability, accuracy, and overall measurement performance.", "One of the many constrains of High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (High NA EUVL) is related to resist thickness. In fact, one of the consequences of moving from current 0.33NA to 0.55NA (high NA) is the Depth of Focus (DOF) reduction. In addition, as the resist feature lines shrink down to 8nm half pitch, it is essential to limit the aspect ratio to avoid pattern collapse. The direct consequence of such a situation is that a resist thickness of 30nm, usually used for 32nm pitch dense line/space (LS), will not be suitable for 16nm pitch, where the target thickness is expected to be 15nm thickness or less to ensure a similar aspect ratio. The question we need to answer is how the resist thickness reduction will impact the various metrology techniques needed to properly set up a process. To address this question, a set of wafers using both Chemical Amplified Resist (CAR) and Metal Oxide Resist (MOR) at different thicknesses and with different types of underlayer have been generated for LS patterns at 32nm pitch. We first investigated the impact of film thickness by scanning electron microscope (SEM) on the imaging of CAR resist lines. To start with, our current Best-Known Methods (BKM\u2019s) were used to acquire the SEM images. As resist thickness decreases, noise level and image contrast are observed to degrade dramatically. Such an image quality degradation may directly impact the quality of the CD measurements both in terms of accuracy and precision. In this paper we investigated the thin resist wafer set described above using various techniques, such as Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope (CD SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Low Voltage SEM (LV SEM), scatterometry, Pattern Shift Response (PSR), and optical defect inspection. The impact of the resist thickness is estimated for each approach, and optimal settings were investigated to minimize the relative impact on metrology. Our results indicated that, in most cases, alternative operation conditions and BKM settings, sometimes drastically different from the usual operation condition, must be used to guarantee the metrology requirements. Our results show that, despite the impact of thinning resist materials, it is possible to find appropriate settings to strengthen the metrology quality output.", "Background: Lithography advancements require resist layer thickness reduction, essential to cope with the low depth of focus (DOF) characteristic of high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet lithography (HNA EUVL). However, such a requirement poses serious challenges in terms of resist process metrology and characterization, as patterns in thin resist suffer from low contrast, which may affect the performance of the edge detection algorithms used for image analysis, ultimately impacting metrology. Aim: Investigate e-beam imaging using low landing energy (LE) settings as a possible way to address the thin resist film metrology issues. Approach: A low-voltage aberration-corrected SEM developed at Carl Zeiss is to image three thin resist thicknesses and two different underlayers, at various LE and number of frames. All images are analyzed using MetroLER software, to extract the parameters of interest [mean critical dimension (CD), line width roughness (LWR), and linescan signal-to noise-ratio (SNR)] in a consistent way. Results: The results indicate that mean CD and LWR are affected by the measurement conditions, as expected. Imaging through landing energy unravels two opposing regimes in the mean CD estimate, the first in which the mean CD increases due to charging and the second in which the mean CD decreases due to shrinkage. Additionally, the trend between LE and linescan SNR varies depending on the stack. Conclusion: We demonstrated the ability of low-voltage aberration-corrected SEM to perform thin resist metrology with good flexibility and acceptable performance. The landing energy proved to be an important knob for metrology of thin resist.", "To understand extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography performance of various materials (resists, underlayers etc) or processes (bake, development etc.) in terms of process window (PW) and defectivity, we typically use e-beam based tools (e.g., CDSEM) or optical inspection and defect reviews. The optical inspections can scan large areas quickly to pick up potential defects but give little information about the defect\u2019s morphology. The e-beam inspections provide us with metrology information (CD, PW etc.) and detailed defect characteristics, but is very slow. To connect this gap, i.e., to be able to make high-level projections about process window variations and probable defectivity while scanning small area quickly, we need an intermediate analysis methodology bridging optical inspection and CDSEM analysis. With this objective, we present a new data analysis methodology for understanding process variations and probabilities of developing defects, by performing statistical analysis of the local CD variations for line/spaces patterned using EUV lithography. The local CDs obtained from a CDSEM image are assumed to follow the normal distribution curve. The deviations from the distribution i.e., the outlier local CD data, represent potential bridge and break defects and can help identify the probabilities of obtaining these defects for a process, material, condition etc. The outlier counts are obtained by performing statistical hypothesis testing (e.g., generalized extreme studentized deviate test) of the local CDs. Additional metrics such as p-value of the Shapiro-Wilk hypothesis test for local CD distribution are also measured to quantify the degree of normality of the distribution. Using these metrics, we compared different resists, underlayers and L/S pitches to demonstrate the novel utility of this data analysis method in understanding process variations and finding probable defects. We also demonstrate the validity of this analysis method by correlating the obtained outlier count with the standardized line roughness measurements and defectivity counts.", "In this work, a novel spectral interferometry technique called vertical travelling scatterometry (VTS) is introduced, demonstrated, and discussed. VTS utilizes unique information from spectral interferometry and enables solutions for applications that are infeasible with traditional scatterometry approaches. The technique allows for data filtering related to spectral information from buried layers, which can then be ignored in the optical model. Therefore, using VTS, selective measurements of the topmost part of an arbitrarily complex stack are possible within a single metrology step. This methodology helps to overcome geometrical complexities and allows focusing on parameters of interest through dramatically simplified optical modelling. Such model simplifications are specifically desired for back-end-of-line applications. Three examples are discussed in this paper: monitoring (i) critical dimensions of a first metal level on top of nanosheet gate-all-around transistor structures, (ii) the thickness of an interlayer dielectric above embedded memory in the active area, and (iii) critical dimensions of trenches on top of tall stacks in the micrometer range comprising many layered dielectrics. It was found that, in all three cases, data filtering through VTS allowed for a simple optical model capable of delivering parameters of interest. The validity and accuracy of the VTS solution results were confirmed by extensive reference metrology obtained by traditional scatterometry, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.", "A unique challenge has emerged in the Channel Hole process module of advanced 3D NAND manufacturing: control of the lateral silicon nitride recess post Channel Hole etch. A novel mid-infrared critical dimension (IRCD) metrology has been developed on a platform suitable for fab production. Compared traditional optical critical dimension (OCD) technology based on ultraviolet, visible, and near-IR light, the IRCD system exploits unique optical properties of common semiconductor fab materials in the mid-IR to enable accurate measurements of high-aspect-ratio (HAR) etches with high Z dimensional fidelity. Utilizing the mid-IR wavelength range, a robust and unique measurement methodology is demonstrated to measure the lateral silicon nitride recess that occurs post channel hole etch due to etch bias between silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. IRCD metrology is proven to have higher unique sensitivity for lateral silicon nitride recess than other inline non-destructive metrology techniques.", "As lithography patterning focus tolerance shrinkage in advanced production fab, defocus due to scanner wafer table or pre-layer contamination has been considered as a yield-loss killer and wafer scrap contributor. Traditionally, we can only apply a fixed by-wafer/by-zone spec to monitor leveling performance, lacking flexibility for further defense system design or root-cause analysis. In this paper we develop a comprehensive solution to capture focus/chuck spot in a high-volume manufacturing environment. This algorithm can automatically detect and categorize defocus spot into focus and chuck spots. Meanwhile, this algorithm produces an overlapped map for back-tracing pre-stage contamination and regularly send an alarm in customized schedule to prevent serious yield loss.", "Historically, the development of high-density ICs has been a series of challenges, and we have overcame them and finally succeeded in mass production. However, the time from initiating product development to mass production is increasing, and moreover, it is taking longer than ever to reach maximum production yields. In this manufacturing environment, reducing development and yield ramping-up time is the most important factor in maximizing productivity and profit, and the key solution for this is MI technology. However, in order to respond to next-generation semiconductor products based on complex 3D structures, MI technology is going beyond the requirements especially for highly localized and non-destructive monitoring of 3D profiles. In this paper, we will discuss the evolutionary direction of these MI solutions. First, we will define the MI challenges that come along with the structural difficulties of new product, and review the changes in technology that have evolved in each field to overcome them. We will also explore the limitations of these technologies and see what new methodologies can be nominated to overcome them. We'll also look at what technical elements are required for HVM and what lessons can be learned from the examples in real production. Finally, we will propose how semiconductor MI technology should change its role through new innovations.", "Modern overlay metrology instruments have evolved into systems that provide large amounts of data points (up to 4 overlay targets/sec). Traditionally, this data has been analyzed using models that are based on physically expected parameters. They are typically derived from translation, rotation and magnification (both symmetric and asymmetric) at reticle and wafer level. The resulting coefficients of these models can be directly fed into the scanner to correct overlay errors. As overlay requirements have become more stringent, higher order corrections have been enabled, ultimately leading to corrections-per-exposure (CPE) where no model is used at wafer level. Instead, a different correction at reticle level is allowed for each field. Although this approach has been extremely successful for overlay control purposes, it is increasingly difficult to interpret the resulting models and appreciate the underlying root causes for the overlay corrections as well as for the overlay residuals. This is especially true for new lithographic technologies where all contributors to overlay errors may not be fully characterized yet. In order to gain more insight into the root causes of these overlay errors, we have proposed a model-less overlay analysis technique [1]. In this paper we will apply this method to understand the impact of wafer stack on overlay through wafer heating in EUV lithography. Wafer heating-induced overlay signature is a typical example where the conventional overlay models cannot properly describe the wafer signature and only CPE models can be used to adequately correct. By comparing the signatures of highly reflective (resulting in little wafer heating) with highly absorbing (resulting in more wafer heating) wafer stacks, more insight is gained into the factors that contribute to the overlay corrections.", "Aberration is one of the contributors to edge placement error (EPE) variation and overlay error in the scanner system. In the EUV system, aberration-induced wavefront errors can have a much bigger impact than the in a DUV system due to significantly reduced wavelength and heating effect from illumination energy loss through reflective optics. Although in-situ metrology of the scanner system can extract wavefront information accurately and it can be feedbacked for aberration control, dynamic heating effects during long-time full-field exposures and tool-to-tool performance gap by aberration variation in high volume manufacturing (HVM) should be directly monitored on the wafer patterning result for reliable process control. This study aims to identify the feasibility of aberration monitoring on the wafer by using an e-beam metrology tool. Simulation work is performed first for source adjustment and the selection of generic designs of aberration-sensitive patterns of dark field Ta-based EUV masks. For quantitative analysis, the wavefront phase error is directly modulated (dialed-in) in the EUV system, and a wafer is exposed for each modulation condition. The wavefront error induced by the modulated aberration is extracted from measured CD data, using an optical simulation model. We finally discuss the correlation between the extracted aberration and the modulated wavefront error. Based on the result in this work, we investigate the feasibility of the potential application of e-beam metrology on dynamic aberration variation in HVM.", "The performance of image-based and diffraction-based overlay metrology depends on the quality of optical signal returning from the buried mark. A desirable class of hard mask materials are the metal-based hard masks. The challenge with metal-based hard masks is that they are typically opaque in the visible range. To enable overlay metrology, a costly process integration scheme replaces the opaque material over the overlay target, while another detects residual topography propagating through the film. Here we discuss the progress towards the fully automated Scanning Probe Metrology tool that combines surface and subsurface channel information in a single image to measure overlay through opaque films.", "A recently introduced novel concept ellipsometry, characterized by its unique derivation process of directly extracting the polarization information from the hologram image on pupil plane, has been evaluated experimentally targeting for the application to OCD and overlay tools. With an improvement of splitting the hologram on the pupil, this self-interferometric pupil ellipsometry (SIPE) has gained the capability of measuring all of Stokes parameters (S0-S3) throughout the incident angle of 0 to 72 degrees with omnidirectional orientation. A prototype system incorporating SIPE technology has been fabricated to conduct the performance test with patterned test samples for overlay and CD evaluation, the result of which exhibits the sufficient sensitivity to dimension variation and superior repeatability for practical use. The measurement of thousands of ellipsometric data on pupil only takes tens of milliseconds at the most, realized by leveraging the advantages of self-interferometry that does not have any rotating elements in optics. The experimental result demonstrates the consistency with the simulation results based on TEM data within entire pupil. In the front-line of advanced semiconductor manufacturing, the main obstacles to OCD application, low sensitivity and parameter coupling, have been evaluated, which indicates good prospects with SIPE technology.", "High aspect ratio (HAR) structures found in 3D NAND memory structures have unique process control challenges. The etch used to fabricate channel holes several microns deep with aspect ratios beyond 50:1 is a particularly challenging process that requires exquisitely accurate and precise control. It is critical to carefully analyze multiple aspects of the etch process, such as hole profile, tilt, uniformity, and quality both during development and production. X-ray critical dimension (XCD) metrology, which is also known as critical dimension small-angle X-ray scattering (CD-SAXS), is a powerful technique that can provide valuable insights on the arrangement, shape, and size of periodic arrays of HAR features. XCD is capable of fast, non-destructive measurements in the cell-area of production wafers, making XCD ideal for in-line metrology. Through several case studies, we will show that XCD can be used to accurately and precisely determine key properties of holes etched into hard mask and multilayer oxide / nitride (ON) film stacks. We show that the measurement of hole tilt can be achieved without the aid of a structural model using a fast tilt methodology that provides sub-nanometer precision. Measurements were performed across several production wafers to determine the etch uniformity and quality. Particular attention was given at the edge of the wafers to account for large variation observed.", "Optically opaque materials present a series of challenges for alignment and overlay in the lithography process flow. We demonstrate the efficacy of picosecond acoustic microscopy (PAM) in generating 2D lateral images of structures embedded under opaque layers, including the potential of PAM to generate 3D images by analyzing scanned z planes.", "Critical dimension uniformity (CDU) control using dose correction is well established and has relied on traditional polynomial models like Zernike and Legendre for a long time. As process margins are shrinking and CD (and CDU) control becomes a significant contributor to edge placement error (EPE), the dose correction models need to be enhanced to represent the systematic behavior of the fingerprints more precisely. In this paper we show that many CD signatures over the exposure field or over the wafer cannot be corrected efficiently using classical polynomials. As the CD signatures can come from a variety of processes like etch, CVD, polish, or deposition, a flexible model approach is required. Furthermore, making the right decision when choosing the correct model order of the classical polynomial based model is complicated as we need to handle the balance between the degrees of freedom and minimizing the residuals. With this problem statement in mind, we introduce a novel radial basis function (RBF) modeling approach for dose corrections that can correct a wide range of signatures. The new modeling approach is verified on real CD signatures on product, reducing CDU significantly. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach can make the life of the engineers easy again, as there are no prior decisions about model type and order needed.", "Improvements on on-cell overlay is necessary to suppress misalign induced defects. Precise and accurate on-cell overlay measurements are strongly demanded, however, we are facing limitations on conventional CD-SEM based on-cell overlay measurements, such as unexpected overlay bias. To mitigate drawbacks of top view based on-cell overlay measurements, we present voltage contrast based overlay measurements (VCBO) which utilize specially designed cell patterns with combinations of programmed misalignments on scribe lanes, measured by defect inspection equipment, eP5 [1]. We successfully demonstrate the first defect based overlay measurement on DRAM device and a potential of 27% in-die overlay gain is shown. Also, we display overlay process margin at about ~1000 points on wafer. As a definite standard of on-product overlay measurement, this technology will be used for advanced misreading correction (MRC). We believe that the technique would be widely used and become necessary in near future.", "State of the art after-develop (ADI) overlay is measured with multi-wavelength micro diffraction-based overlay techniques. A micro diffraction-based overlay target consists of two pairs of gratings, with the same pitch in the top and bottom layer. The gratings in the top layer have a bias offset with respect to the bottom layer in the positive or negative direction. When illuminated, +1st and -1st order light is diffracted. The asymmetry in the intensity of these signals contains the overlay information. In this paper, ADI overlay is measured with a new dark-field target design for ADI overlay. Like a micro diffraction-based overlay target, it consists of pairs of gratings in the top and bottom layer. Instead of a bias offset between top and bottom gratings, different pitches are used resulting in a continuous-bias throughout the grating pair. When illuminated the diffracted light contains moir\u00e9 fringes, in which the overlay is stored in the phases. This technique has improved accuracy and robustness by design, because it is immune to symmetrical process changes like stack height variations and grating imbalance. Additionally, it shows more stable behavior through wavelength, both in signal strength and overlay. These characteristics make it possible, with a single wavelength, to achieve similar or better performance than micro diffraction-based overlay using a multi-wavelength solution, resulting in higher throughput. This is demonstrated on Samsung\u2019s latest memory node where on average an 21% reduction is achieved in the 3sigma of the mis reading correction with a single-wavelength phase-based overlay measurements, compared to multi-wavelength micro diffraction-based overlay measurements.", "At the 3D-NAND analysis site, the variation in the channel hole shape of the entire laminated structure is evaluated threedimensionally by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to determine the etching conditions in each stacking process. Then, the feedback is given to the stacking process. In other words, quick observation has been required to evaluate the channel hole shape and the layer number accurately in association with each other. The current observation method identifies all the layers by counting manually. However, there is a concern that the observation time will increase due to the miniaturization and multi-layering of devices. As a solution to this problem, we have devised the method to determine a designated layer by joining together Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI) and SEM. CSI has capability of nanometerorder height measurement to identify the target layer. To move SEM field of view (FOV) to the designated layer accurately, CSI height map is converted to the XY coordinates of SEM stage by homography transformation. We introduced a new common specimen holder between CSI and SEM to reduce the position error caused by the difference of instruments. Experimentally, the accuracy of XY directional FOV movement in the SEM after coordinate conversion was verified. It was confirmed that the target FOV movement accuracy of 256-layer was achieved by using the common holder. We have the prospect of a new method that can observe the designated layer with high throughput rate because highly accurate data measured by CSI in Z-direction can be acquired.", "As semiconductor industry moves to advanced node, capability to well-control On Product Overlay (OPO) becomes a major task force in HVM environment in recent years. In order to continuously sustain OPO at better production level for critical layers, processing on one dedicated immersion (IMM) scanner is a traditional method to meet the quality purpose. However, the tool dedication method impacts IMM scanner throughput and therefore increases cost of ownership for the manufacturing. The ability of smoothly de-stacking the process layers to other IMM scanner without heavily losing OPO performance levels up the full-route productivity, hence enables the cost down opportunity. In this paper, we present a run-to-run APC control methodology and demonstrate the capability to well predict the model terms for inline production scenarios.", "In recent years, advances in semiconductor technologies have resulted in the continuous shrinkage of the process window required to fabricate a device, and specifically, the shrinkage of the overall overlay budget of the critical layers. Among other variables, a key contributor of wafer-to-wafer overlay variations is scanner alignment strategy. In high-volume manufacturing (HVM), the reduction in alignment mark count can lead to productivity improvement, however, that tradeoff impacts the scanner alignment layout and overlay model performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of an in-line production experiment and simulation results to evaluate overlay performance by cooptimization of scanner alignment mark count, layout for High Order Wafer Alignment (HOWA) model.", "The device shrinkage, associated with the latest nodes, comes with tighter overlay budgets. To meet the tighter overlay budgets unconstrained metrology of the device itself is often used to feed the growing complexity of the control loops with dense intra- and inter-field data. ASML\u2019s Self Reference (ASR) In-device metrology has been demonstrated on Front-End-Of-Line (FEOL) and used successfully in High Volume Manufacturing (HVM). In this work we will demonstrate for the first time accurate, robust and reproducible after-etch ASR-based in-device measurement capability for new applications: Active Cut and Storage Node Contact layer. Finding a robust and cost-effective metrology solution is challenging on Active to Active cut, due to low signal strength for any device metrology technology. To be able to measure the overlay of the Active to Active cut currently a special wafer with under-etch is needed, to enhance the contrast. This extra process step and the need for a sacrificial wafer make the approach expensive, difficulty breaking between Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU) and Overlay, not easier for high order correction and not suitable for HVM. In this work we successfully introduce for the first time the method of ASR-based recipe setup for Active cut layer to remove this extra process step. Middle-End-Of-Line (MEOL) storage node contact layer currently no other after etch measurements are possible at this process step which makes the ASR-based measurement capability even more valuable. The speed and accuracy of this method, combined with an integrated after-development and after-etch control loop, is predicted to bring yield gains over the wafer.", "As processes become more complex, and more operations are needed to fabricate individual levels in a sem iconductor chip, the ability to leverage the wealth of information to fully monitor and control the process has become of critica l importance. In this work we extend the application of design-aware fabrication process models to more operations. While one could expect that the process models become more accurate with respect to the target of interest, one of the main benefits of applying this technique is that it further decouples the individual influences that every process step imposes to different designs at different stages of the fabrication process. These results have significant implications on how this methodology can be used to improve process monitoring, a nd in the future extend to process optimization and design specific process control.", "Difficulties in availability of important metrology test artifacts is being addressed with a new advanced metrology patterning reticle, AMAG7, which makes available again and updates the suite of key metrology diagnostic and experimental content to the industry previously provided by SEMATECH AMAG. New content covers a broad range of scale regimes from the absolute resolution limits of iArF lithography up to 1um for comparing to larger scales, and including new use cases which have evolved since previous AMAG reticles such as features for contour metrology, EPE, two-level gratings and more. The main grating content of lines, trenches, holes, dots and many variations thereof, is in form of 547 huge 0.8mm gratings measurable by any type of CD measurement tool in discussion in the metrology sector including CD-SAXS with large spot sizes but also by any other tool type with smaller sampling areas, resulting in new IP-neutral test vehicles to enable full open collaboration across the industry. This poster will introduce the newly-designed AMAG7 pattern and demonstrate the achievable lithography and possible test artifacts that can be enabled.", "In semiconductor inspection and metrology on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, image noise affects the results of inspection and metrology. Image accumulation is effective for denoising but slows image grabbing duration. To get low noise images in high throughput inspection and metrology, we developed a novel denoising algorithm that converts a lowaccumulated image into a clean image like a high-accumulated image. Noise2Noise is one of the image denoising technologies by deep learning for natural images. In this method, clean images are not required for training because the Noise2Noise model is generated with pairs of original images and noisy images created by artificially adding Gaussian noise to the original images. It is more practical than other deep learning methods because collecting clean images is usually difficult. On the other hand, Noise2Noise doesn\u2019t perform enough in SEM images because the noise on the SEM image is not Gaussian noise. To solve this problem, in this study, we analyzed SEM noise characteristics by changing SEM conditions to create the artificial SEM noise. Furthermore, we developed the novel denoising algorithm which is based on Noise2Noise but is specialized to train the artificial SEM noise. We confirmed the improvement of the roughness precision of the proposed method compared to the deep denoise model trained using simple artificial noise. We discuss the impact on throughput advantage of inspection and metrology by applying the proposed method in NGR3500.", "Semiconductor manufacturers are increasingly motivated to reduce overlay (OVL) target size. The scribe line area is in high demand, especially as width reduction efforts persist. Furthermore, since overlay control challenges require a higher sampling density, there is a growing need to place ultra-small targets inside the active chip, especially for devices with a large area. One of the main challenges of this new reality is producing smaller cell (grating) sizes to form smaller overlay targets, while maintaining compatible measurements to the standard target size of the same design. To overcome this challenge on typical scatterometry-based overlay (SCOL\u00ae) targets, we describe a method developed to perform the preliminary evaluation on a standard cell size of 8\u03bcm. This method selects a scalable setup by predicting performance on a 3-5um cell with the same target design (TD) parameters. This allows chipmakers to qualify the OVL measurement during process development on standard size targets, with the confidence that the optimized measurement conditions will be carried over to the smaller targets, saving time and real estate. However, even for scalable designs, target size reduction necessarily forces some size-performance tradeoffs: factors that are negligible for a standard target size can have significant impact on a scaled-down version of the same target design. In this paper we analyze these factors, show how they relate to measurement indicators, and present a method to apply such indicators toward setup selection. For each setup candidate this method can provide predicted performance and measurability as a function of cell size, a powerful tool for target area reduction.", "Among metrology tools in the semi-conductor manufacturing, critical dimension scanning electron microscopes (CD-SEM) are the most broadly used, especially due to their high resolution, low destructivity, and high throughput. Contour metrology on CD-SEM images has become essential for characterization, modelling, and control of advanced lithography processes. In particular, OPC model\u2019s accuracy can be highly improved using contours metrology. One of the issues when dealing with CD-SEM metrology is that the results are noise sensitive. Moreover, diminishing noise in CD-SEM acquisition leads to resist shrinkage due to exposure time increase. In addition, post-treatment of these shrinkage effects requires compensation algorithms such as artificial intelligence (AI)- driven algorithms, that are another contributor to the error budget of metrology systems. There is thus a need for an accurate, robust to noise, and purely deterministic edge detection algorithm. In this article, we evaluate the benefits of relying on a model-based contour extraction approach for performing measurements. This approach is applied onto both synthetic and experimental CD-SEM images with various patterns (mostly 2D) and noise levels to assess the influence of image integration (frame number) on the contour detection and CD measurement. We demonstrate that a model-based contour extraction algorithm is able to precisely characterize SEM-induced 2D resist shrinkage. We observe that this model-based approach is more robust to noise than standard algorithms by 21% on synthetic data and by 36% on experimental data. Another way of seeing it is, while keeping the same precision, a model-based contour extraction approach can significantly reduce the requested image frame number. The benefits of adopting this approach range from reducing the shrinkage effects to improving SEM image acquisition time. Eventually, no step of shrinkage modelling calibration nor AI-driven image post processing are needed which implies a gain on simplicity and avoids modelling errors.", "As the semiconductor industry rapidly approaches the 3nm technology node, on product overlay (OPO) requirements have become even tighter and, as a result, reduction of residual overlay errors have become more important and challenging. Metrology performance enhancements are required to meet these demands. Using angle-resolved pupil imaging, Scatterometry Based Overlay (SCOL\u00ae) is a unique overlay metrology architecture that includes massive multi-signal analysis to enable improved accuracy and residuals reduction. In this paper we present a new Rotated Quadrupole (RQ) illumination pattern for SCOL metrology systems designed to enable broad measurable landscape coverage, support additional target design pitches with smaller target dimensions, and improve tool-to-tool matching (TTTM). These improvements enable the SCOL measurement system to provide higher measurement accuracy, reduce residuals error, and improve robustness to process variation. In this paper we will cover theory, some use cases, and measured results.", "As 3D NAND advanced technology moves to increasingly denser storage capacity, the film stacks required to create these devices correspondingly increase in quantity and height, creating additional manufacturing and yield challenges. This is especially true for photolithography and specifically for on-product overlay (OPO) control.[1] Multiple sources of process variation impacting overlay need to be considered, controlled, and optimized to yield functional products: complex alignment and overlay schemes, etch tilt effect for deep, high aspect ratio contact etch processes, high order in-die stress overlay, and more. Traditional lithography feedback control is insufficient to cover all these sources of process variation and requires a potentially high Pi-run rate and rework rate, which in turn results in higher costs and lower revenues. Generally, data feedforward is the right solution to handle large lot-to-lot (LxL) overlay process variation. However, as more variation factors interact in the 3D NAND manufacturing processes, a simple feed-forward methodology is insufficient to keep OPO in spec. One critical challenge is that when the alignment and overlay reference layer are not the same, feed-forward will over-correct based on alignment [2]. Further, as other sources of variation may come from different layers and components, feed-forward from only one single layer becomes inadequate for accurate, robust, and optimal OPO control. In this work, we deploy a methodology and corresponding system to provide a feed-forward solution for critical layers. With a workflow from the latest generation 5D Analyzer\u00ae data analytics solution, inline OPO is simulated with this new feed-forward strategy. A run-to-run (R2R) system is deployed and validated in a real manufacturing production line. Finally, we observed inline OPO results have improved 50%, and the rework rate has been reduced to <10%.", "In the SADP process, the final spacer line roughness is the key challenge for good pattern transfer. To understand how each process step contributes, the role of roughness in different frequency ranges (Low, Middle, High) is extremely important and it was thoroughly analyzed using unbiased power spectral densities. In this way, it was possible to observe that the deposition step introduces Low to Middle frequency LWR. By tweaking the thin film stress levels during deposition, it is observed that LWR of the final CD of the spacer line can be improved further after the etch step. Applying proper etch step tuning, the etch power condition optimization can reduce line wiggling (responsible for Low frequency LER), while gas flow adjustment can minimize residue from re-deposition (and therefore improve Middle frequency LER). Using the insights in frequency range enabled rapid reduction of LER and LWR by focusing the development methods in both deposition and etch.", "Accurate alignment sensors are needed for tight overlay requirements. The interplay of alignment sensor lens aberrations and process variations (such as layer thickness variation or line width variation) can produce position measurement errors. We propose a new method called TIAS (two-beam imaging alignment sensor) where we can achieve high accuracy even in the presence of lens aberrations. It has added benefits of high image contrast and greater depth of focus. We confirmed the aberration robustness of TIAS by our experiment. TIAS technique is not only applicable to alignment sensing but also to image-based overlay (IBO) measurement.", "As a part of the semiconductor manufacturing process, an overlay measurement instrument is used to inspect overlay accuracy after exposure. The overlay measurement results are not only used to evaluate accuracy, but also to optimize exposure processing by calculating various offsets based on the measurement results and feeding them back to the exposure system. Increasing the number of overlay measurement points can help identify and compensate for local distortions including EPE (edge placement errors). However, it is not practical to perform overlay measurement for all wafers and all regions, therefore the better strategy for is performing correction through combining predicted results with actual measurement results. Canon is working with Macronix to develop the VMOM (Virtual Machine Overlay Metrology) system for predicting overlay measurement results. The VMOM method uses machine learning to study large amounts of data to derive the relationship between overlay error results and exposure system process variables that cause overlay error. A VMOM model was developed using 3D-NAND process data and overlay prediction accuracy and exposure process optimization were evaluated. This paper reports the development status of the VMOM system and the practical effects of the system.", "In advanced lithography, controlling overlay budget is critical, and how to control on production overlay(OPO) quality well as 100% measurement sampling in high volume manufacturing fab will be an impossible mission. Nevertheless, most of HVM fabs encounter with almost the same problem for low sampling lot, wafers, even less measurement points by reason of facility and Fab space issue and cost. No matter how critical overlay need, the advanced process correction (APC) maintaining the overlay performance under 10%~15% lot base sampling with 4 wafers may be the limitation in most of HVM fabs. Base on the 100% measurement conception and possibility, CXMT begin to study ASML cMetro (computation Metrology) possibility through measuring uDBO in Yield Star and combining with scanner leveling information, coming to catch overlay issue wafers and make sure overlay quality as 100% sampling measurement. To achieve this, conventionally, users try to study process possibility in leveling information between with overlay behaviors under the immersion critical layers. To identify the layer strategy and program successful, how to input and build-up cMetro modeling is reasonable and the monitor result is anticipated catching inline overly issue lots under cMetro prediction will be vitally important, no matter going through scanner leveling data method or combining with uDBO measurement as HDOM model. However, this approach will be time-consuming in the beginning due to not only several leveling condition and spilt are necessary, but also need to collect SSO (sampling scheme optimization) or sparse map and high dense map in uDBO measurement. Aiming to speed up the turnaround time, CXMT focus on layers with warpage experience and define the lots & wafers & map sampling to find the correlation. As a results, cMetro HDOM model monitor is possibility to hold up the issue overlay lots even under real inline measurement sampling for 10~15%.", "As the technology node shrinks, the systematic defects such as the missing and extra pattern are generated in the process of cell patterning. The defect such as the extra and missing pattern can lead to a critical failure on device. Subsequently, the systematic defect in the UBE could be an etch-gas path on proceeding the etch process and cause the quality degradation of device. In this paper, we propose an automated system to inspect the systematic defect in the cell array with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image and the physical design. The method consists of conversion, matching, and detection. In the conversion method, the SEM image is converted into the layout using image processing such as noise reduction, segmentation and contour tracing. In the following matching method, gradient descent optimization is used to match the coordinate of layout converted from the SEM image with the coordinate of physical design. In the final detection method, the defect is detected by inspecting the patterns of two layouts. On the test of 2,500 data, we confirmed that the accuracy improved from 97% to 100% as a result of comparing the engineer's visual inspection method with the proposed method. In addition, the turnaround time (TAT) is improved by approximately 40 times. The proposed system is currently applied to DRAM products and used for the field of design for manufacturing (DFM) and manufacturing process.", "The random error has been increased relative to the systematic error in overlay misalignment, as the Critical Dimension(CD) of semiconductor-design shrinks to under the 20 nm on DRAM and single-digit nanometer on Logic. The random error comprises diverse factors including non-lithography context, which caused by intricate process other than the scanner itself, hence it\u2019s hard to control through conventional control methods using control knobs of scanner . In this study, we show that how effectively control and reduce on product overlay(OPO) error through making the most use of the conventional control knobs aided by machine learning. In addition to showing improved results, we address that conventional overlay feedback control with weighted moving average(WMA) can give rise to fluctuation of OPO error over entire wafer area, especially on the edge of wafer, due to the lack of control capability or flexibility. As a result, we show that 15.7% of OPO error can be trained and predicted for in-fab data and OPO has been improved from 2.29 nm to 2.08 nm or 9.2% on average over 5-steps of 1,201 lots with simulator.", "As device dimensions continuously shrink in semiconductor manufacturing, even tighter overlay control is indispensable to secure good device yield. Using traditional optical overlay metrology via scribe-lane marks it is challenging to achieve good intra-field high-order process correction (iHOPC) due to the limited mark count and uneven mark distribution. Also the scribe-lane based metrology may not fully represent the in-device behavior in some cases. In order to achieve improved accuracy and precision of in-device overlay control, new metrology methodology solution is required. In this paper, three complementary overlay metrology techniques \u2013 high voltage scanning electron microscope (HV-SEM), optical scatterometry critical dimension measurement (SCD), and traditional scribe-lane based optical overlay metrology \u2013 were adopted for in-device overlay improvement. In 3D NAND device production, in-device overlay measurement is getting more challenging due to the thicker or complex film stack. Though both HV-SEM and SCD are able to measure in-device patterns via capturing buried structures, their different tool principles make them suitable in different situations. Through applying non-zero offset (NZO) overlay compensation at photo exposure, the in-device overlay performance can be enhanced by iHOPC, which is enabled by incorporating high-density in-device sampling measurements from HV-SEM and SCD into traditional optical scribe-lane optical overlay measurements. The improved overlay performance was demonstrated for different process layers in this study.", "Overlay is one of the critical parameters and directly impacts yield. Due to high metrology cost, only a small number of wafers are measured per lot. To this end, virtual metrology (VM) aims to provide valuable information about the nonmeasured wafers with little to no additional cost. VM leverages historical per-wafer measurements from exposure tools and processing equipment collected at previous process steps to report overlay on every wafer. As data-driven approaches gain more adoption in the semiconductor manufacturing, machine learning (ML) is a natural choice to tackle this task. In this paper, we present the strategies of learning overlay prediction models from exposure and process context data as well as the steps for achieving desired prediction performance, including data preparation, feature selection, best modeling methods, hyperparameters tuning and objective. We demonstrate our methodology on a large HVM dataset under stable APC conditions.", "Critical Dimension measurement in the final slider-level fabrication is essential in the development and manufacture of magnetic read/write heads for hard disk drives (HDD). It validates the device level geometry that plays a dominant role in the magnetic performance of the writer and provides critical feedback to the wafer-level head fabrication process control. Measurement at the slider-level affords the true Air Bearing Surface (ABS) view of the real device that can only be approached by the destructional cross-section at wafer level [1,2]. While the large set of CDSEM images of writer ABS at slider level enables an excellent statistical view of wafer uniformity, it also poses special challenges to the metrology due to a substantial number of variations from the upstream wafer process. The large structure variations observed at the sliderlevel is particularly prevalent in the initial development phase where large DOE (Design of Experiment) are designed to produce intended structure variations, and low process maturity yields large unintended variations among the devices. A traditional metrology used in such a variant data set requires extensive tuning or even a set of separate solutions with each solution in the set only applicable to a small subset of the variations. However, this approach is inefficient and demands high engineer resources. In this work, we use a machine learning based metrology approach to process the large set of magnetic writer device images at the slider level. For the current study, we use a model-based solution that was trained with deep learning (DL) using a dataset from 4 different head designs. The model aims to retrieve precise boundaries of the head to perform accurate measurements. We demonstrate the progressive robustness of the model-based solution by expanding the training set to measure the CD of writer poles with different designs and large process variations due to the intrinsic wafer level structure variation and the image distortions from the slider fabrication process. In addition, we will demonstrate the efficiency of the Deep Learning (DL) based solution in comparison with traditional metrology and manual measurements on the same set of data.", "In order to achieve pattern shrinkage of the memory device, the manufacturing process is getting more complicated and the production period is getting longer. Therefore, the methodology of predicting fab-out electrical die sorting (EDS) test results from in-fab metrology (CD, Optical CD, Thickness, etc.) data is becoming increasingly important. In this study, we propose a novel methodology to improve the fab-out EDS prediction of memory device with in-fab metrology data. Since fab-out EDS results of memory device are binary data consisting of pass or fail at the chip level, indices based on binary classification are suitable for verifying correlation between in-fab metrology data to fab-out EDS results. However, in memory device production, the number of pass chips is much larger than that of fail chips. So in this case, the data imbalance of the pass/fail chip ratio in memory semiconductor production can lead to distortion of binary classification indices such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. We modified the accuracy equation of binary classification to compensate for distortion of binary classification indices due to data imbalance, allowing us to determine chip-level in-fab production specifications (specs) more accurately. We also confirm that the fab-out EDS prediction error has decreased 37.5% when using new in-fab production specs determined by our effective accuracy equation.", "Circuit designs are becoming denser and more complex in advanced semiconductor process technologies. The foundry process windows are becoming smaller and smaller which increases sensitivity to wafer surface defects. These defects should be detected early to resolve the root causes and eventually help to improve the yield. Wafer defects are still often inspected manually while the defect counts can reach into the millions. It takes a long time to analyze and review the results while the identification of the root causes may be less accurate and buried in noise. In this paper, UMC advance research teams, in collaboration with the Cadence DFM team, utilized the Pegasus Computational Pattern Analytics (CPA) software to develop an enhanced inspection flow. This flow includes defect data preprocessing, classification, filtering, and reduction of huge data volumes to create visible and easy to review results. By finding more accurate root causes, we could reduce process develop time and finally improve wafer yields.", "A variety of middle-of-line lithography overlay (OVL) and process window (PW) parameters have been monitored using PDF Solutions Design-for-InspectionTM (DFITM) in 14nm FinFET technology. The DFI system, which incorporates voltage contrast (VC) electron beam (e-beam) technique on PDF Solutions knowledge based test structure designs, has proven to assist lithography overlay control and process diagnostics, covering process loops of epitaxy, metal gate (MG), contact on active (M0A), contact on metal gate (M0P) as well as segmentation cuts of M0A and MG. In-line eBeam scans are performed after Contact CMP, and OVL and PW parameters are extracted from the curve fitting of VC signals responding to misalignment values. For each process module, dedicated test structures with different layout attributes are designed and placed on the wafer to characterize OVL and PW sensitivity to feature density, geometry and substrate doping. In this work, the concept of DFI system, with specific illustration of DFI M0A to MG OVL measurement to assist inline OVL control and process fix is reported. Although eBeam-based Voltage Contrast techniques traditionally have been used to detect Open and Short failures, and cannot be used to directly measure critical dimensions (CD) of patterned features, the DFI system is designed to monitor integrated process window (PW) variation introduced either by an intentional process split or an unintentional process/tool drift in production line. The results presented below demonstrate DFI capability to assist in-line OVL and PW control for yield enhancement, production monitoring, and excursion prevention.", "Understanding contributors to critical dimension uniformity (CDU) is becoming ever more important. We propose a systematic CDU breakdown into contributions that can be attributed to local CDU, intra-field CDU, field-to-field CDU, intra-lot CDU and lot-to-lot CD variations using smart metric definitions. We checked the CDU breakdown on synthetic data as well as on real DRAM production data. Comparing our CDU breakdown to results from nested ANOVA made with statistical software packages, we could verify that the results were very close, while our calculation method was orders of magnitude faster.", "Predicting the best preforming overlay marks for a set of layers in a new technology process flow would provide a powerful tool, which could potentially streamline the time consuming measurement process search for the optimal overlay mark. This is challenging because integration of the next generation of transistors and interconnects is becoming increasingly complex, so evaluating overlay mark performance in isolation yields partially valuable results. We show how process emulation can be used to evaluate overlay marks in conjunction with optical simulations for the critical patterning levels, and only the marks that perform well in simulation are allowed on the final mask, thereby predicting the best overlay marks for a particular technology. To make this methodology useful, it is important to cater each analysis to the specific materials being used, their optical properties, and the integration scheme of the technology. This is done as follows: (a) the optical properties of the materials being used are extracted using standard metrology tools, (b) the process flow of an existing technology is emulated, (c) an initial optical model is created with the inputs for settings like wavelength and focus form the metrology tool configuration, (d) the images from the overlay tool for the existing technology are analyzed to calibrate for unknowns such as numerical aperture and coherence, and finally, (e) the calibrated model is used on future technology flows to evaluate the performance of overlay marks. We will illustrate the validity of this methodology using specific examples and highlight its predictive capability.", "In recent years, the 3D NAND stack has continued to expand rapidly in the Z direction with tighter process windows, while deck-to-deck overlay faces increasing measurability and accuracy challenges. Meanwhile, thick opaque hard mask (HM) has been utilized in several layers, thus downgrades a lot of mark contrast and introduces large process variation (PV). To meet tightened overlay requirements, KLA\u2019s Metrology Target Design (MTD) assisted by simulation analysis has become an important part of the holistic overlay improvement solution set. Compared to the conventional target design simulation process in which the target stack is built up with a standard template, in this work, a customized template was designed to fit actual mark behavior. Using this new template, more accurate simulation to measurement (S2M) matching was demonstrated, which makes the new target design more reliable. With this added benefit, the newly designed target achieved desirable residual improvement with better on-product overlay (OPO) performance. In the case of the challenging thick opaque HM layer, target segmentation and CD/Pitch optimization by simulation also significantly improved mark contrast and OPO using the newly designed mark. Along with contrast gain, the robustness against large PV of the simulated mark was increased by quantifying comprehensive PV on product wafers. Furthermore, with the verification of the measured data, simulation data can be used to establish a more thorough representation of the process characteristics and parametric sensitive virtual metrology, targeted to meet the goals of maximizing overlay accuracy in the 3D NAND process.", "In scanning electron microscope (SEM) image simulation, it is necessary to consider the charging of electron beam irradiation, which can be computationally intensive. Therefore, we have developed a neural network-based algorithm to generate SEM images by inputting the shape and material properties of semiconductor devices, after which various preprocesses are applied to the physical parameters to improve the accuracy. The contrast and visibility of the generated images are then compared with simulation results that are not included in the training dataset. As a preliminary result, we found that the physical parameters that affect charging, such as the relative permittivity and electron mobility of the material, can be predicted. The effect of acceptance is also considered in the training process to reproduce the changes in image quality depending on the type and arrangement of detectors.", "Overlay metrology plays a significant role in process and yield control for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing. As the On-Product Overlay (OPO) in advance nodes is reduced to a few nanometers, a very small margin is left for measurement inaccuracy. We introduce a multi-wavelength (spectral) analysis and measurement method, capable of characterizing overlay inaccuracy signatures on the wafer, and quantifying and removing the inaccuracy portion of the overlay measurement, resulting in a more accurate measurement, better process control, and yield enhancement. This method was applied to SK hynix\u2019s advanced process production wafers, demonstrating an enhancement in accuracy over single-wavelength based overlay measurements.", "A double patterning Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch (LELE) process developed in a test vehicle for Back End of Line manufacturing is investigated using rigorous, physics-based three-dimensional computational models. The wafer topography consists of TiN, SiO2, Spin-on-Carbon, Spin-on-Glass (SOG), over which the photoresist patterns are printed. The lithography step of the LELE flow is simulated using PROLITH, and the etching steps are simulated using ProETCH, a new dry etch simulator developed at KLA. Two clips that are spatially close to another and present in the photomask layout for the first and second lithography steps are considered to investigate the impact of etch process conditions on etch bias. We found that the final etch bias during the LELE processes is dominantly induced during the etch of SOG. The tapered profiles induced during the SOG etch process are due to the polymerization by CFx radicals produced in the plasma. The effect of varying the neutral-ion-flux ratio on the etch bias is investigated. Etch process development for SOG needs to balance multiple targets to avoid defect formation.", "It has long been understood1 that in photolithographic mini-environments, acetic acid reacts with residual ammonia to form salts that cause haze formation on the scanner optics. It also induces cosmetic defects (satellite defect) on the surface of the photoresist. The acetic acid is generated in multi-function chemical filters, where PGMEA (a photoresist solvent) undergoes hydrolysis in the acidified media used to remove bases, producing PGME and acetic acid. Acetic acid is difficult to measure in the gas phase at parts-per-billion levels, requiring either costly and cumbersome mass spectrometers that are unsuitable for deployment in a production environment, or ion chromatography, a labor-intensive, off-line technique commonly performed off-site by a third-party analytical services lab. In this manuscript, we report on a novel AMC monitoring solution for measuring acetic acid, PGMEA, PGME, NH3, and other VOCs (volatile organic compounds). The heart of the system is a real-time laser-based analyzer based on a new analytical technique called Broad Band Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (BB-CRDS). The VOC monitoring system has several features which make it well-suited to AMC measurements in the production environment: ultra-trace measurements of a variety of VOC species; 24/7 operation without user intervention; little to no consumables; unparalleled accuracy without the need for calibration. The AMC system also consists of a high performance 8-port multiplexer, monitoring the photolithography bay at STMicroelectronics - Rousset fab. Here we report on acetic acid and PGMEA levels observed in several track tool and scanner minienvironments, over a period of several months.", "In modern DRAM processes, there are some critical layers that are particularly challenging for overlay (OVL) control. The conventional method of metrology target design for these challenging layers is to verify target performance using simulation based on the specific, final device process. After full simulations, target measurability issues can be encountered where the limited, available solutions (open hard mask, create topography, etc.) are costly and high risk. However, in DRAM new product R&D, there is always some tolerance for process tuning. The use of virtual Archer\u2122 OVL measurements in metrology target design (MTD) can simulate metrology performance for these potential process splits, helping to find a good balance between process options and metrology performance. A significant improvement in target contrast for imaging-based overlay (IBO) is demonstrated by simulation on one of these challenging layers after process optimization as compared to the baseline (BSL) process. In this paper we will present the virtual MTD detailed flow and design considerations to achieve an optimized process and target design. The contrast of a key performance indicator (KPI) is improved by more than 30%, enabling OVL measurability of the challenging layer in new processes.", "There is widespread recognition in the industry that as the design rule decreases, the number of airborne molecular compounds that can drive defect formation is increasing at an exponential rate [citation: IRDS 2020]. The vast majority of these new critically important AMCs are volatile organic compounds. These VOCs are difficult to measure in the gas phase at the parts-per-billion and parts-per-trillion levels that are needed for the tight process control requirements of advanced design rules. In this paper, we report on a novel AMC chemical metrology solution for measuring critical VOCs that are relevant to the photolithography cell. The heart of the system is a real-time laserbased analyzer based on a new analytical technique called Broad Band Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (BB-CRDS). The VOC monitoring system has several features which make it ideally suited to AMC measurements in the production environment: ultra-trace measurements at ppb levels without the need for calibration, 24/7 operation without user intervention, and negligible consumables. The analyzer was integrated into a state-of-the-art multiplexer to monitor ten VOC species in the photolithography cell in a modern semiconductor fab. We report on multiple observations made, including transient solvent leak events, multifunction chemical filter performance, and baseline characterization of AMCs inside track tools.", "As the development technology of 3D NAND advances, it becomes increasingly important to measure the mid and bottom profiles of High-Aspect Ratio(HAR) hole or line structures. To estimate the HAR structure profile, SEM is generally used to measure the bottom CD using a high acceleration voltage, but there are cases where the measured CD does not represent actual bottom CD of the structure. To solve this problem, we propose a method of inferring the actual depth at which the measured CD is located by examining the CD change according to the change in the accelerating voltage of the electron beam and the inclination of the incident beam. After inferring the CD measured from the actual hole and line structure, the method was validated on samples with geometrically known structures. It is expected that the method approached in this paper can be used for 3D microstructure measurement using SEM technology in the future.", "PDF\u2019s electrically testable structures, called Characterization Vehicles\u2122 (CV\u2019s), have been extremely successful in characterizing printability windows of the leading- edge technologies for the last 15 years. We have been able to demonstrate clear correlations between the electrical misalignment data and product yield for several technology generations and these CV\u2019s have been employed in all leading foundries. However, their placement is limited to the scribe lines and in many fabs they are tested only at the end of wafer processing. We have conducted many experiments that demonstrated their accuracy vs. the cross-sectional TEM and concluded that the final edge placement error (EPE) does not always correlate to in-line overlay measurements, and often exceeds by far the allowable tolerances, leading to the product yield loss. With the multiple patterning schemes and recently EUV, there is a clear need to fully characterize the EPE budget in the technology development and, if this information is available in-line, use this information for process control by feeding it back to the scanners. Over the last 8 years a new technology called Design For Inspection\u2122 (DFI) has been developed and already proven in all major foundries. Specially designed test structures are placed within the product die in place of the filler cells and dummy fill without any area penalty, as well as in the scribe lines, which allows for the EPE monitoring with sub-Design Rule designs. All DFI structures are tested with a custom (designed and manufactured by PDF) eBeam voltage contrast tool with a very high speed and sub-nm resolution for the EPE characterization. The new vector scan eProbe-250 tool is capable of testing billions of DFI structures sites with a speed up to 5 billion sites/hour on a single wafer. Contrary to the typical eBeam machines, it utilizes the gray scale data from the tool to allow for the marginality extraction (soft failures which may have significant reliability impact). This allows for extensive Design of Experiment (DoE) to be performed to fully characterize the EPE and other process marginalities. This DFI methodology has been enthusiastically received by not only foundries but also leading fabless companies and more than 20 tape-outs of MultiProduct Wafers (MPW\u2019s) and actual product wafer scribes have been already executed proving the value of this methodology from the 14nm down to 5 nm nodes. This methodology has been currently applied to the EUV characterization where the overlay and local LER variations contribute the most to the EPE budget.", "Airborne chemical contaminants (AMCs) in the lithography cell are responsible for yield-impacting issues such as scanner haze and wafer defects. Detecting and monitoring these chemicals in real-time is critical in IC fabs. Many technologies have been deployed to monitor AMCs, but many of them are not production-worthy solutions that meet the stringent sensitivity and throughput requirements driving Moore's law. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated AMC monitoring system, Picarro SAM (Sample. Analyze. Monitor.), that detects a variety of chemicals in real-time from multiple locations in a lithography cell. Multiple scanners, track tools, and reticle stockers are monitored 24X7 for excursions of critical inorganic AMCs such as hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide, as well as volatile organic compounds such as acetic acid, PGMEA, NMP, siloxanes, etc. that impact the performance of the lithography process. The SAM system integrates sensors based on Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) with a high-performance sampling system. While CRDS is an established technology to detect critical inorganic AMCs, here we demonstrate the ability to measure several critical VOCs using a new technique called broadband CRDS. SAM monitors contaminants in various parts of the scanner and track with multiple sampling tubes extending to a hundred feet or more to accommodate remote areas of the process tool. The SAM system is a fast, easy-to-use, production-ready analytical tool to monitor trace VOC and inorganic contaminants in the parts per trillion to low ppb range within seconds that helps engineers take corrective actions much faster than ever before.", "Current best practices for the extraction of critical dimensions (CDs) from microscopic images requires semiconductor process engineers to analyze images one by one, which is tedious, prone to human bias, time-consuming and expensive. Automated CD extraction using machine learning methodologies is an approach to accelerate and improve the accuracy of this process. Deep learning convolutional neural nets specifically can be used effectively for image segmentation and identification of different material regions; however, providing enough annotated data for training and testing is an ongoing challenge. Here, we demonstrate a method where only one sample image is needed for the neural net to learn how to extract the CDs of interests. The methodology is specifically demonstrated for extracting CDs from a metal assisted chemical etching process. Each experimental SEM image is automatically measured in about 45 seconds. The extracted CD measurements are within 4 nm (<5% error) of the human measured CDs. This automated extraction enables process engineers to improve the accuracy of their metrology workflow, reduce their total metrology costs, and accelerate their process development.", "The metrology FOUP (M-FOUP) is a self-contained metrology tool in a wafer carrier. This metrology concept, which was designed and manufactured by SEMILAB, is actively being evaluated in GLOBALFOUNDRIES. The M-FOUP system consists of a controller (MCONTROLLER), which controls multiple M-FOUP measurement units. Each independently operated M-FOUP unit utilizes a multi-point spectroscopic reflectometry technique, which can be used for many thickness applications. The self-contained metrology device has advantages over traditional film thickness measurement tools including reduced cost, significantly smaller footprint, and increased availability. In a previous article we focused on the technical details of the M-FOUP unit such as the overall design, the temperature distribution, charging/discharging routine, typical spectra, and typical wafer map. The focus of this work is on integrating the M-FOUP system into a semiconductor fab environment. This requires a high-level orchestration of multiple fab systems including the automated material handling system (AMHS), real-time dispatching (RTD) system and the MFOUP system itself. The management of the metrology jobs and data collection using M-FOUP from a point of view of Manufacturing Execution System (MES) are discussed.", "In a leading-edge high-volume manufacturing fab, lithographers focus on searching for a suitable alignment layout strategy to cover process-induced overlay variation. However, how to minimize scanner cross-chuck overlay impact also draws attention due to WPH loss from chuck dedication. In this paper we evaluate a novel algorithm to analyze lithography scanner process/metrology data and introduce a new KPI called \u201cmodel accuracy\u201d for alignment sampling layout strategy creation, which takes into account robustness index as wafer-to-wafer/chuck-to-chuck variation. Combined with simulated overlay performance, an optimal alignment layout strategy is recommended for a maximum coverage of cross-chuck overlay, which leads to maximum productivity.", "One of the most critical challenges in the lithography process is to effectively control all critical patterns over the full exposure field, across wafer, and from lot to lot consistently. ASML\u2019s advanced dose-control solutions have been widely adopted to control CDU of critical patterns. A new high-order dose-control capability is introduced with extended controllability over a larger number of patterns to mitigate the stochastic effect and optimize dies-in-spec performance. Traditionally, designed marks or patterns are placed in the die for dense metrology sampling required for the advanced high-order dose-control applications. However, this method has a few disadvantages especially for logic foundry use cases. For example, the designed marks are often not identical to random logic critical patterns, thus leading to a situation in which marks are controlled well while device patterns are not. In-die placement of the designed marks normally imposes constrains in device layout, which is not acceptable in some cases such as large-die layouts. A preferred approach would be to measure directly on device-critical and/or weak-point (WP) patterns. But this brings up another challenge in metrology of device WP patterns. With conventional CDSEM the amount of data points is limited by the tool throughput. WP patterns are typically 2D patterns, with normally a high noise contribution from local variations (due to resist stochastics) and metrology. Thus to suppress the local variations, averaging of many local measurements of 2D WP patterns is preferred. This requires a high throughput e-beam metrology tool capable of making massive amount of inline measurements within a given cycle time. To address these challenges, we have developed a method of using yield-limiting device patterns to directly control dose and thus improve CDU. Close to 100 WPs per in-die location have been selected with a dense die coverage to minimize the contribution to global CDU from the local variations and metrology noise. A high-speed e-beam metrology tool is used to measure all the selected WP patterns. A CDU budget breakdown (BB) has been analyzed to identify and quantify CDU contributors, such as reticle fingerprint, OPC error, local CDU, metrology noise, etc. Different in-die WP sampling and dose-control methods are studied in this work to achieve optimal CDU correction while keeping the metrology cycle time under control for HVM implementation.", "Direct self-assembly (DSA) can form periodic fine patterns by the repulsive forces between different polymers. As one of the candidates for next-generation lithography, it has been evaluated for semiconductor manufacturing processes for the past 10 years1-11 . Reports of DSA processes using Chemo-epitaxy show many line-and-patterns formed using lamellas and few hole patterns using cylinders. The reason why it is difficult to form a hole pattern is that the direction of line-and-space misalignment is one-dimensional, whereas in the case of a hole, it is two-dimensional, so dislocation defects are likely to occur and process control is difficult. On the other hand, the pitch of hole patterns in semiconductor devices is shrinking year by year, and in the future it may not be possible to form them all at once even with EUV (Extreme ultraviolet) lithography. Therefore, it is expected that there will be an increasing demand for shrinking patterns using DSA additionally. In this presentation, we report on the method of forming a hole pattern by the chemo-epitaxy process and the process condition setting, and discuss the possibility of application to the semiconductor process.", "Imprint lithography is an effective and well-known technique for replication of nano-scale features. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) manufacturing equipment utilizes a patterning technology that involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. The technology faithfully reproduces patterns with a higher resolution and greater uniformity compared to those produced by photolithography equipment. Additionally, as this technology does not require an array of wide-diameter lenses and the expensive light sources necessary for advanced photolithography equipment, NIL equipment achieves a simpler, more compact design, allowing for multiple units to be clustered together for increased productivity. Previous studies have demonstrated NIL resolution better than 10nm, making the technology suitable for the printing of several generations of critical memory levels with a single mask. In addition, resist is applied only where necessary, thereby eliminating material waste. Given that there are no complicated optics in the imprint system, the reduction in the cost of the tool, when combined with simple single level processing and zero waste leads to a cost model that is very compelling for semiconductor memory applications. In this review paper, we touch on the markets that can be addressed with NIL and also describe the efforts to further improve NIL performance. In addition, we describe recent efforts to develop pattern transfer processes that can be used to address edge placement error. As a final topic, we describe Canon\u2019s efforts in developing a sustainable future and touch on how new methods can be applied to reduce waste and enable environmentally friendly solutions.", "NanoImprint Lithography (NIL) is not a novel technology anymore1 but huge progress has been achieved for its industrial introduction since its first reporting. One of the main evolutions concerns the use soft stamp media2 ,which is now a standard technology. EVG introduced this technology with a full wafer imprint solution (the size of the stamp corresponds to the size of the wafer to print)3 and results obtained since five years are at the state of the art. Repeatability, uniformity, sub-50nm resolution and high aspect ratio patterns are addressed at the same time4\u20136 . Nevertheless, some challenges still remain, as e.g overlay7 and in particular the distortion phenomenona 8 , which contribute to the remaining overlay next to global translation and rotation. This study is focused on distortion effect which appears during NIL process using flexible backplanes and its minimization by using different materials. A polymer backplane is compared with a glass backplane which are used as carrier to the soft stamp material. A dedicated methodology to precisely measure this distortion is implemented to remove global alignment signature. Distortion signature is firstly evaluated with a standard soft stamp material and process of reference already established. Distortion fingerprint mapping is obtained for each wafer. Thanks to this mapping, a monitoring distortion plot is extracted, in order to follow the evolution of the distortion depending on wafers (wafer-to-wafer) and lots (lot-tolot). This study highlights that the use of a glass backplane developed by EVG clearly allows to improve the distortion in terms of magnitude but also of stability.", "Imprint lithography is an effective and well-known technique for replication of nano-scale features.

DRAM memory is challenging, because the roadmap for DRAM calls for continued scaling, eventually reaching half pitches of 14nm and beyond. For DRAM, overlay on some critical layers is much tighter than NAND Flash, with an error budget of 15-20% of the minimum half pitch. For 14nm, this means 2.1-2.8nm. DRAM device design is also challenging, and layouts are not always conducive to pitch dividing methods such as SADP and SAQP. This makes a direct printing process, such as NIL an attractive solution. The purpose of this paper is to review the performance improvements related to edge placement error (EPE) for NIL. Key EPE components include overlay, local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) and global critical dimension uniformity (GCDU). In this work, we review each component, summarize current capability and present a roadmap for improving EPE to meet future generations of DRAM devices.", "Scaling the cell size of phase change memory (PCM) is crucial for reducing reset current and enabling energy-efficient switching. Because memory arrays have a regular pattern, block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) is uniquely suited for reducing patterning costs for future nanoscale PCM. Here, we realize the fabrication and electrical characterization of a PCM array with Ge2Sb2Te5 phase change material featuring 20-nm cells patterned by DSA. Our confined cell PCM devices with ~20 nm bottom contact diameter switch at ~150-200 \u03bcA, while maintaining a resistance on/off ratio of ~10. We also discuss some factors for further consideration for improving the limited endurance of such nanoscale confined cell PCM. Our demonstration would inspire further reduction of the PCM cell size below 10 nm using high-\u03c7 block copolymers, thus paving the pathway towards ultrahigh density memory.", "The application of curvilinear masks for DUV lithography has demonstrated benefits over Manhattan masks for improved process window, mask consistency, sidelobe printing control and MRC. However, the prior high cost of using curvilinear masks has limited the usage to critical areas and prevented its broader adoption in production. With recent technology advancements, multi-beam mask writers are capable of meeting specifications of advanced patterning nodes, and curvilinear masks can now be extended to advanced EUV lithography generations. ILT is known for its advantage of creating a patterning-optimized curvilinear mask through field operations. It has been used to solve the most challenging lithography problems with superior quality. Computational costs have previously limited widespread ILT deployment to only the most advanced production mask synthesis flows. To create curvilinear masks for full-chip layout, a faster curvilinear OPC solution for less critical regions will be a valuable complimentary option to curvilinear ILT. In this paper, we will present a hybrid curvilinear mask solution with ILT and Curve OPC for full-chip EUV layers. Results of full-chip EUV in lithographic performance and runtime will be compared among different solutionsincluding traditional Manhattan OPC, Curvilinear ILT and hybrid machine learning (ML) ILT plus Curve OPC. Another important factor of curvilinear mask advancement is data volume. We will present our Curve OPC solution with Cubic Bezier curve to control the data volume of curvilinear masks. The mask write process is playing an increasingly important role in overall manufacturing flow. Therefore, we also present an extended mask synthesis flow utilizing a mask error correction (MEC) solution for curvilinear masks written by a multi-beam writer.", "MBM-2000, the latest multi-beam mask writer of Nuflare Technology, Inc. (NFT), have achieved reasonable writing time in mask fabrication of 3nm semiconductor technology node, which demand small curvilinear patterns in EUV masks and curvilinear OPC patterns in optical masks. For less line edge roughness and better pattern fidelity, however, the demand of lower dose sensitivity resists keeps increasing. In such a situation, the beam exposure time can be the main bottleneck of the writing time. In order to meet the demand, NFT has developed MBM-2000PLUS, which achieved high beam current density of beamlets \u00d71.3 larger than MBM-2000. As the result, the writing time became constant up to 170 \u03bcC/cm2 exposure dose condition without confinement by beam exposure time. Even at the region of exposure dose confinement, the writing time became 20% less than MBM-2000 at 200 \u03bcC/cm2 dose condition. In addition, charge effect reduction (CER), which is an electron optics system reducing resist charge effect, has been upgraded from MBM-2000 for improving image placement accuracy. Furthermore, MBM-2000PLUS inherits pixel level dose correction (PLDC) function from MBM-2000 as the solution for less edge placement error and better pattern fidelity. In this paper, those features of MBM2000PLUS are highlighted including improvement of pattern fidelity by PLDC function. In order to verify PLDC, a new methodology of quantitative evaluation of pattern fidelity using sine-shape pattern is introduced.", "Helical structures with novel optical and mechanical properties have been demonstrated and are commonly used in different fields such as metamaterials, microfluidics and cell scaffold. None of conventional fabrication methods has the throughput or flexibility required for patterning large surface area with tunable pitch. In this paper, we report a novel method for high-throughput volumetric fabricating helical structures with tunable shape based on multiphoton polymerization (MPP) using single-exposure, self-accelerating beam with adjustable rotating intensity profile. The lightfields are generated based on high-order Bessel modes and an analytical model is derived to describe the generation and propagation of light-fields. The method is used to fabricated micro-helices with different pitches and handedness in SU-8 photoresist. Beam splitting and galvo-scanning can be implemented in the system. The fabrication of large-scale helical matrices is demonstrated. Compared to point-by-point scanning, our method increases the fabrication throughput by orders of magnitude, paving the way for adopting MPP for mass production of functional devices in many industrial applications.", "The feature dimensions of integrated circuits are becoming smaller and the fabrication, metrology and inspection is becoming harder to be fulfilled. Fast-writing of long respectively large nano-features with Scanning-ProbeLithography and their inspection with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is a challenge, for the accomplishment of which the Nanofabrication Machine (NFM-100) can serve as a beneficial experimental platform for basic research in the field of scale-spanning nanomeasuring and nanofabrication. The NFM-100 has an integrated tipbased system, which can be used as an AFM as well as for Field-Emission Scanning Probe Lithography (FESPL). The combination of both systems offers the possibility to fabricate and analyze micro- and nanostructures with high resolution and precision down to a single nanometre over a large area of 100 mm in diameter in a single configuration without tool or sensor change. Thus, in contrast to conventional optical inspection and alignment systems, the NFM-100 offers the potential for full lithographic and metrological automation. For FESPL, the implemented active probes enable an in-situ inspection capability, a quantitative mapping at unprecedented resolution, as well as an integrated overlay alignment system. In this paper, the basic set-up of the NFM-100 as well as the capability of the system for long range AFM scans and FESPL is demonstrated.", "Improved performance and package form factors are shifting traditional designs toward higher density and 3D vertical integration concepts. The introduction of finer RDL lines/spacings provides higher performance but reduces the options for integration and electrification design rules at the package and substrate levels due to potential parasitic electrical effects. In this work, we evaluate high-performance chemically enhanced positive-tone photoresists tailored for high-resolution fine-pitch RDL and \u03bc-bump/\u03bc-pillar fabrication to achieve high aspect ratios and employ maskless exposure to demonstrate their patterning performance. Resolution testing, focus position, and exposure matrices, including resist sidewall profiles, are discussed with respect to 2/2\u03bcm line/space (L/S) requirements and beyond for heterogeneous integration designs.", "Imaging capability of surface plasma based nano-patterning is discussed in this article. The imaging capabilityof 1:1imaging ratio is the basis, which is different with the interference lithography with the frequency multiplicationontheimage plan. In this article, \u201cSuperlens\u201d is discussed. The imaging capability evaluation is based on the rigorouselectromagnetic modelling of Finite Element Method. Theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation are given, detailedimpact evaluation of a variety of important parameters to the imaging capability is presented.", "The inner spacer process is a critical step in gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet FET device fabrication and SiN is the most common material to be deposited after the indentation of the SiGe layer of alternative Si/SiGe layer structure. This gap filling process demands for highly uniform growth in order to minimize transistor variability, the lateral open feature of the indentation brings new challenges to conventional deposition technologies such as low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). In this work, we propose an analytical model of SiN deposition to predict the profile evolution of both LPCVD and PECVD, which can help process tuning and understand the influence of the multi-layer geometry and process condition on inner spacer growth performance in a more efficient and economical way. Experimental results reveal that the filling effect of LPCVD is significantly better than that of PECVD, simulation results also validate this. We also compare simulations with experiments, by comparing the model output with original SEM image, satisfactory matching between the two profiles demonstrates the validity of this model. Moreover, we set the SiGe layer thickness to be 10nm, 20nm and 30nm, and SiGe indentation as 10nm, 30nm and 50nm. Simulation reveals that the geometry has significant impact on the deposition performance. When the indentation is less than 10nm, both LPCVD and PECVD exhibit good SiN coverage. However, when indentation is deepened from 10nm to 30nm and 50nm, for PECVD, void firstly forms in 10nm thick SiGe layer and the necking effect tends to form larger void in 20nm and 30nm thick SiGe layers. For LPCVD, however, SiN grows more uniformly within and outside the cavity, and only very narrow gaps form in the cavity.", "The new generation of 10nm node DRAM devices have now adopted EUV based patterning techniques. With further shrink in design rules, single exposure EUV processes will be pushed further using advanced photoresists and new mask types. However, in absence of high NA EUV lithography ready for high volume manufacturing (HVM) until at least 2025, acceptable local CD (critical dimensions) uniformity and yielding process windows at low exposure dose are a challenge for single exposure EUV. Further, for EUV implementation in sub-32nm pitch DRAM capacitator patterning applications, multi-patterning techniques must be explored. In this paper, EUV based double-patterning techniques have been demonstrated to pattern honeycomb array contact holes and pillars. The processing utilizes two EUV masks, using simple angled line space patterns. We have explored two different types of double patterning options: litho-freeze-litho-etch (LFLE) to pattern contact holes and litho-etch-lithoetch (LELE) to pattern pillars. In the absence of high NA EUV, these processing techniques are useful to pattern tight pitch (e.g., 32nm) contact holes/pillars for newer generations of DRAM devices. Another key objective of this paper is to present a set of metrology characterization methods to enable proper process optimizations.", "Continued momentum in the development of EUV photolithography toward high volume manufacturing has increased photoresist purity requirements that accelerate improvements in resolution, sensitivity, and line edge roughness. Previous research indicates 1,2,3 that the composition of photoresist materials is a major contributor to stochastic effects as semiconductor device critical dimensions decrease. Photoresist is a mixture of small molecules of PAG (photo acid generator) and quencher, and large polymer molecules, whose molecular weight can pose significant challenges to filtration and purification operations. It is critical to maintain the compositional balance, stability, and uniformity of photoresist to ensure expected lithographic performance. Contamination control (filtration + purification) technology is important to maintain a material\u2019s purity, removal of undesired species, to improve lithographic performance. This paper describes research to develop a new filter evaluation method to understand and assess interactions of filters with photochemicals. The study investigates the ability of various filtration materials to improve polymer uniformity in an EUV polymer analogue. This study also demonstrates the efficacy of optimized filtration design to capture different contamination sources and improve polymer distribution uniformity, providing recommendations to reduce contaminants and their impact on stochastic issues.", "Here we present a methodology for identifying and characterizing nanoscale sites in EUV photoresists which deviate from the mean composition by 3\u03c3. The methodology is based on Nano-Projectile Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) operating in the in the event-by-event bombardment detection mode. Nanoscale analysis is achieved by probing the surface stochastically with a suite of individual nano-projectile impacts where each nano-projectile samples a volume 10-15 nm in diameter and up to 10 nm in depth. For each impact the coemitted secondary ions are collected, and mass analyzed, allowing for the analysis of co-localized moieties. We applied this method to study the changing film composition in an EUV resist and isolated measurements with a probability below 0.3%. By examining these measurements, we can identify rare sites on the surface that may correspond to molecular aggregations in the surface. In a developed film, the mass spectrometry measurements showed that the photoacid generator, PAG, cation displayed decreased homogeneity on average with increasing exposure dose. The effect was more pronounced in the sites with probabilities below 0.3%, where the measured intensity of the PAG cation in these sites was over 2-fold larger than the mean. Thus, we attribute these nanoscale sites to aggregations of PAG within the top 10 nm of the film. These rare sites may be important in defect production and film stochastics.", "In chemically amplified resists (CARs), it is known that catalyst diffusion is accelerated by the deprotection reaction. However, the mechanisms that drive this enhancement are not yet known as it is difficult to probe local changes in polymer chemistry and density during the reaction, as well as their effects on catalyst diffusion, through experiments alone. We examine catalyst diffusion in a model terpolymer CAR, both in the presence and absence of reaction, using a combination of experiments and atomistic simulations. From experiments, we find that deprotection rates are faster than film densification, and that reaction enhances long-time catalyst diffusion lengths by a factor of four. From simulations, we find evidence that catalyst mobility is enhanced in recently reacted regions of the terpolymer. These results provide insight into the origins of accelerated catalyst diffusion during reaction, and will be utilized in the development of physics-informed models of CAR systems.", "In photoresist processing a prebake is traditionally used after coating the photoresist on a wafer to drive off solvents in the resist, resulting in a more stable film. In comparison to other stages of the lithography process (e.g. the conditions of exposure and post-exposure events), limited attention is paid in the prebake optimization for the EUV application. In this work, investigation is done to clarify its role for the case of chemically amplified resists (CAR). Compared to the earlier DUV application, this resist is used at significantly smaller thicknesses and has a significantly different composition in terms of photo acid generator (PAG) and quencher types and concentration. In a first screening, a commercial CAR material \u2013 coated on Si \u2013 was investigated towards contrast changes at different prebake temperatures. It was found that lower temperature can result in adhesion failure when substrate conditions are not optimized for adhesion. With proper adhesion promotion however, it was found that prebake temperature could be lowered significantly or even omitted, without clear change in contrast. Using model resists in combination with residual gas analysis (RGA), it was found that the use of photo-decomposable quencher could be responsible for maintaining contrast to lower bake temperatures. In a second investigation, an assessment towards outgas risk was done when using resists at lower prebake temperatures in EUV scanner environment. Finally, the printability of commercial CAR was tested on the NXE3400 EUV scanner at different prebake temperatures. This was done by coating the CAR on two available underlayer materials: spin-on-glass and deposited underlayer. Results show that the prebake temperature could be reduced or even omitted without a clear deterioration in process window, line edge roughness and defectivity. It was found that proper choice of underlayer material could even improve slightly the printing performance at lower prebake condition.", "New photoresists are needed to advance Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Tailored design of efficient resists is impossible without a fundamental understanding of EUV induced chemistry. In EUV resists, due to the high energy of the incident photons, most of the chemistry arises from the emitted electrons and not the EUV photons themselves. The absorption of an EUV photon by a resist film leads to the emission of primary electrons, which, through a cascade of inelastic scattering events, cause excitation of molecules and subsequent emission of secondary electrons. The electrons may travel up to tens of nanometers before losing their kinetic energy via collisions which initiate chemical reactions. Because the electrons are playing a leading role in EUV patterning, initiating chemical transformations, it is important to characterize their generation, transport, and energy distribution. Previously, we demonstrated a suite of experimental techniques capable of characterizing EUV absorption, electron yield, and electron attenuation length of resist materials. In this work we demonstrate how to experimentally investigate the energy spectrum of those electrons via EUV photoelectron spectroscopy of thin films. We explore how different elements or functional groups may change the energy distribution of emitted electrons, aiming to understand how to control the electron cascade.", "The dissolution (including the formation of transient swelling layer) of a resist polymer is key to the realization of ultrafine patterning. However, the details of the dissolution of resist polymers remain unclarified. In this study, the swelling and dissolution kinetics of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS) film in pure water and alkaline aqueous solution were investigated. PHS is a typical backbone polymer (a dissolution agent) of chemically amplified resists. By changing the length of alkyl chains of amines, the swelling and dissolution kinetics of PHS were observed. Their dependences on the film thickness of PHS and the concentration of amines were discussed.", "Photoresist metrics such as resolution, roughness, CD uniformity, and overall process window are often aimed to realize the full potential of EUV lithography. From the view of the materials supplier, improvements over the aforementioned metrics can be achieved by optimizing the functional materials used under the resist. The underlayers can significantly enhance the resist performance by providing appropriate adhesive forces to the patterned features, counterbalancing the tendency of pattern collapse, and improving the resist/substrate compatibility. In this study, we introduce spin-on-glass (SOG) underlayers that can provide adhesion to resist through different mechanisms, including covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, and Van der Waals force. The underlayers were characterized in depth to understand their coating quality, adhesion to resist, and surface energy. The EUV lithographic performance was evaluated by applying chemically amplified resists (CARs) directly onto these SOGs for line/space features at the target pitch sizes of 30 nm and 28 nm. The lithographic evaluation indicates that the patterning performance strongly depends on resist/underlayer adhesion. By appropriately adjusting the resist/underlayer adhesion, we can realize 28 nm pitch printing with defect-free depth of focus larger than 300 nm and unbiased line-width roughness around 2.2 nm. The plasma etch rate of the SOGs were also evaluated to assess their pattern transfer performance.", "In extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), underlayers have been introduced to improve process window, stochastic printing failures, LWR and even photo-speed. As a result, studies about chemical and physical interactions at resist-underlayer interface have been reported and appropriate designs of silicon based hardmasks and thin organic underlayers for EUVL have been proposed for recent years. EUV underlayers are required to have not only chemical moieties for EUV specific functions but also proper physical properties. The thickness of underlayer has continuously shrink down to a few nanometers to reduce dry etch burden for effective transfer of small patterned features to substrates. In this paper, we report noticeable property variation of an organic underlayer thin film by confinement effect upon thickness reduction. We investigated the thickness effect on key factors, such as film density, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), film Tg and surface energy, and consequent impact on EUVL performance while chemical composition of underlayers were not altered.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is crucial to achieving smaller device sizes for next-generation technology, although organic resists face substantial challenges, such as low etch resistance, which limit the resolution of smaller features. Area-selective deposition (ASD) is one potential avenue to improve pattern resolution from organic EUV resists by selectively depositing material on one region of the resist, while preventing material deposition on an adjacent region. We therefore evaluate the compatibility of various organic EUV resists with area-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes, including considering the effects of photo-acid generator (PAG) and EUV exposure on polymer properties and selectivity. The thermal stability of thin resist materials at the TiO2 deposition temperature (125\u00b0C for 60 minutes) is confirmed with water contact angle and atomic force microscopy. Upon TiO2 ALD from TiCl4 and H2O, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry reveals successful TiO2 deposition on poly(tert-butyl methacrylate), poly(p-hydroxystyrene), and poly(p-hydroxystyrene-random-methacrylic acid) polymers, regardless of PAG or EUV exposure. However, TiO2 inhibition is observed on poly(cyclohexyl methacrylate). Thus, we demonstrate that EUV polymers can serve as either the growth or non-growth surface during TiO2 ASD, an insight that can be used to enable resist hardening and tone inversion applications, respectively. These results serve as a basis for further ASD studies on EUV resist materials to improve pattern resolution in next-generation devices.", "In this study, a molecular resist capable of high-resolution patterning with excellent sensitivity was pursued by introducing a metal atom into a small molecular fluorinated core. After selecting the phthalocyanine (Pc) unit as a molecular framework, exhibiting excellent chemical stability and etch resistance, fluorinated alkyl and aryl moieties and zinc atoms were incorporated into the framework to complete the synthesis of Pc-based EUV resists. Analyses of the recovered compounds were performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT IR), and ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy to confirm that the structures of the desired materials were secured properly. Through the electron-beam lithographic experiments, it was verified that all the thin films composed of the three Pc materials lost their solubility by interacting with high-energy electrons to form negative-tone images. When EUV lithography was carried out on ZnPc-A, which has linear perfluoroalkyl moieties, 40 nm-sized patterns were formed at the relatively small energy of 34 mJ/cm2. From the synthesis and lithographic characterization results, it can be assumed that fluorinated metallophthalocyanine materials can be considered EUV resist candidates. However, for highresolution patterning, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate film thickness and adjust the processing parameters, including the adhesion to the substrate.", "In this work, imec and Zeon introduce the resist with new concept and report the lithography performance. Zeon has developed a new resist (ZER02#05M) in order to improve both resolution and lithography performance because conventional Zeon resists generated worse resolution and kissing(C/H)/pinching(L/S) defects at tight pitch by top loss. The lithography performance at hexagonal contact hole (C/H) patterns with ZER02#05M is presented at ADI. For P40nm hexagonal C/H pattern in ADI by new resist, the lithography performance at CD17.5 nm in hole CD was achieved at the exposure dose of 92 mJ/cm2, giving a LCDU of 2.74 nm. It at CD18nm in P38nm hexagonal C/H pattern was resolved at 105 mJ/cm2, with a LCDU of 2.95 nm. t at CD18nm it at CD 17nm in P36nm hexagonal C/H pattern was resolved at 92 mJ/cm2, with a LCDU of 4.12 nm. Entire results with ZER02#05M could improve LCDU compared to ZER02#04DM, especially at larger CD. Additionally, patterning performance in AEI with 05 which did not optimize polymer properties could transfer patterns well and enhance LCDU compared to ZER02#04DM.", "The improvement of EUV photoresists is a key enabler for the deployment of High-NA EUV lithography and future technology nodes. Research in this field is supported by a joint research program between PSI and ASML. This program is dedicated to supporting the EUVL community with the development of materials by carrying out resist screening experiments with the EUV interference lithography tool at PSI, with an emphasis on resolution improvement towards reaching High-NA EUV scanner specifications. The tool enables high-resolution patterning without limitations in terms of chemical outgassing or contamination and is, therefore, an effective method for the testing of novel EUV photoresists. In this work, we consider the progress monitored in the second half of 2021. We describe the exposure tool as well as the updates made to the resist characterization metrology implemented at PSI. Resist performances are quantified with regards to resolution, linewidth roughness, and sensitivity. We show an overview of the current development status through a comparative study of different resist platforms. Recent results show chemically amplified resists (CAR) and non-CAR printing 12 nm and 11 nm lines/spaces features, respectively. Limitations of each platform are displayed and general progress and perspectives are discussed to lead the way to higher resolution results.", "Single exposure EUV patterning for lower pitches (below 32 nm L/S) proves to be challenging and dependent on a series of factors including exposure tool related parameters such as illumination conditions but also material related parameters such as sensitivity to EUV photons and resist chemistry. While the industry is focused on developing a set of universal exposure conditions that can be applied to all resist systems, material suppliers must constantly enhance the exposure mechanism of the resists in order to support further advance in technology. The multi-trigger concept involves a reaction that will only occur when multiple elements of the resist are initiated concurrently and in close spatial proximity in order to enable the catalytic reactions. In high dose areas the resist behaves like a traditional CAR, whilst in low dose areas, such as line edges, the reaction is second-order increasing the chemical gradient. Effectively there is a dose dependent quenching-like behaviour built into the resist, enhancing chemical contrast and thus resolution, whilst eliminating the materials stochastics impact of a separate quencher reducing roughness. The multi-trigger resist (MTR) presented consists of a novel multi-trigger control molecule and a crosslinker, which represent the resist matrix, together with a photoacid generator (PAG). Here we present results from work focused on the enhancement of the high-opacity MTR resist. The absorptivity of the resist can be increased by replacing the standard crosslinker with a high-opacity crosslinker. The absorptivity of the crosslinking molecule can itself be changed by varying both the number of attached photo-absorption groups and by varying the specific choice of the high opacity group. Other modifications to the crosslinking molecule, which are presented, include reducing the steric hindrance of the molecule by changing the structure. The high-opacity crosslinker molecules have been synthesized and then formulated into the MTR resist. We report results obtained using the new MTR system containing this high-opacity cross-linker with a variation of process conditions, and with formulation variations. The lithographic performance of a formulation containing this crosslinker, at pitch 32nm patterned on an NXE3400 is presented. The sensitivity of the resist can be increased by 25% by varying the length of the crosslinker arm whilst keeping other factors such as the number of high opacity groups constant. Furthermore, we have also investigated increasing the activation energy of the self-quenching aspect of the MTR system. In the case presented, MTR8 has a higher activation energy than MTR2 and MTR4. Having a higher activation energy is predicted to allow the introduction of a post exposed bake (PEB) to increase crosslinking and reduce pattern collapse, whilst simultaneously preserving the self-quenching behaviour. We will present results which show using a higher activation energy molecule (MTR8) results in a minimisation of Z-factor and LWR, when increasing the PEB temperature by 10 degrees compared to MTR4. Pitch 32nm dense line spaces can be patterned at a dose of 49.5mJ/cm2, a line width of 15.5nm and an biased LWR of 3.69nm. Pitch 28nm dense patterns can be patterned at a dose of 59mJ/cm2, a line width of 12.5nm, and a biased LWR of 3.91nm. These resist formulations have also been used to pattern 25nm diameter pillars on a 40nm pitch with a dose of 50mJ/cm2, and a CDU of 2.98nm. High photospeed approaches, which have patterned p24 and p28 lines and p34 hex pillars at sub-30 mJ/cm2 doses are also introduced", "Scissionable polymers are polymers that will depolymerize under different stimuli including acid, base, and free radicals. These polymers have been investigated in the development of photoresists and other degradable materials. This work focuses on the poly(phthalaldehyde), PPA, a family of scissionable polymers. The PPA backbone consists of acetal linkages that are very sensitive to acids. Upon exposure to acids, the polymer chain depolymerizes to its corresponding monomers. This depolymerization behavior makes PPAs excellent candidates as photoresist materials. Several new PPA photoresists are being explored in this work.", "Characterizing chemical changes in photoresists during fabrication processes is critical to understanding how nanometric defects contribute to film stochastics. We used Nano-Projectile Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NP-SIMS) to evaluate the nanoscale homogeneity of components in positive-tone extreme ultraviolet resists. NP-SIMS was operated in the event-by-event bombardment/detection mode, where a suite of individual gold nanoprojectiles separated in time and space stochastically bombard the surface. Each impact ejects secondary ions from a volume 10-15 nm in diameter and up to 10 nm in depth allowing for analysis of colocalized moieties with high spatial resolution. Individual partially exposed EUV resists were analyzed after light exposure, postexposure bake (PEB), and development. Results showed an expected increase in protonated quencher versus exposure dose, while after development we observed increased abundance in the remaining film. The latter we attribute to poor solubility in the developing solvent. Examining the photoacid generator, PAG, we found decreased PAG cation abundance versus exposure dose in the exposed films, likely due to photodecomposition of the PAG cation. Moreover, after development we observed decreased homogeneity of PAG ions, which we attribute to preferential extraction caused by ion-exchange interactions with the developer. We found that the insoluble moieties persisting on the surface after development were relatively rich in the protecting group, likely due to uneven deprotection of the polymer. Overall, NP-SIMS allows to characterize the resist at the nanoscale and identify conditions that lead to defect formation.", "Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) aqueous solutions has been used as a developer for chemically amplified resists (CARs), dissolving polymer with polar groups generated by exposure. Although the dissolution kinetics of CARs has been widely studied, it is necessary to understand molecular-level information such as interaction between polymer chains, to consider the dissolution of thin and minute resist films that are used nowadays. In this study, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to study the state of PHS chains in TMAH aqueous solution. The effect of the concentration of each ionic species on dispersion of PHS chains was investigated using solutions whose base concentrations were changed by two methods: dilution with pure water and neutralization with acid. PHS chains were well dispersed as the base concentration and ionic strength of the solution increased, while they aggregated as these two factors decreased. We also studied the dissolution behavior of PHS films under nearly identical conditions using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The dissolution of the films was also affected by the two factors described above. In addition to this, with the decrease in the above two factors, we observed formation of large swollen layer as we have reported in the past. We assumed these effects on dissolution of films were mainly due to the acid-base equilibrium at the solid-liquid interface.", "The next-generation extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tool, i.e., the high-numerical aperture (NA) ASML EXE system is now under preparation. As a consequence of the 0.55 NA, EXE scanners decrease the depth-of-focus (DoF) drastically, which requires much thinner photoresist thickness. However, a thinner photoresist process causes line edge roughness (LER) increase. Therefore, roughness mitigation is one of the key elements of high-NA EUV process development. We have studied how to heal LER of thin photoresist processes by illumination and mask. Rigorous simulations were conducted by Sentaurus EUV lithographyTM (S-litho EUV) software provided by Synopsys on a calibrated stochastic Inpria metal oxide resist (MOR) model to adopt the correct photoresist parameter set. Unbiased LER values were experimentally measured on half pitch (hp) 14 nm and 24 nm line and space (LS) as a function of normalized image log slope (NILS) and photoresist film thickness. 24nm hp on 0.33 NA corresponds to 14nm hp on 0.55 NA from the viewpoint of k1 factor (~0.57). NILS of these LS patterns was varied by changing illumination (dipole and annular). By comparing the experimental LER values on silicon with the simulated results, we predicted the LER performance of high-NA EUVL on 14nm hp LS pattern. In this research, we will discuss the better material condition for reduced LER of fine LS pattern at high-NA EUVL.", "Virtual fabrication is used to evaluate the performance of interconnects (line and via resistance, capacitance, etc.) across pitches compatible with either EUV single exposure or SADP for three different process flows: single damascene, dual damascene, and semi-damascene (subtractive metal etch). The effects of process variation for the three flows are also investigated to determine the relative importance of process flow, variation, and scaling when moving toward aggressive pitch interconnects.", "In this paper, an active area cut approach using a self-aligned double patterning process for advanced DRAM was studied using virtual fabrication. The mandrel critical dimension, mandrel line edge roughness, mandrel overlays and spacer thicknesses were selected as input process variables in the virtual DOE to investigate their sensitivity to the final fin cut head to head (HTH) critical dimension (CD) and its uniformity (CDU). For the mean CD, the study illustrates that maximum mean CD can be obtained at a combination of mandrel CDs when the mandrel overlays approach a value of zero. The overlay of mandrel 1 in both the X and Y direction appears to have a stronger impact on the mean CD than the overlay of mandrel 2. We determined that the mean HTH CD decreased 0.44 and 0.93 nm, respectively, when the spacer 1 and spacer 2 thickness were increased by 1 nm. Our simulations also show that CDU is strongly impacted by the mandrel line edge roughness (LER), at a sensitivity of 1.16 nm / 1 nm. The lowest variation and maximum mean CD can be obtained using particular combinations of mandrel 1 CDs and spacer thicknesses. Overlays do not impact the final HTH CDU. From our study, we can provide clear guidance to developers about the relationship between process parameters and final HTH CD and CDU, showing that the integrated process should be centered at particular conditions to obtain an optimal process window.", "This paper reports the readiness of key EUV resist process technologies using Metal Oxide Resist (MOR) aiming for the DRAM application. For MOR, metal contamination reduction and CD uniformity (CDU) are the key performance requirements expected concerning post exposure bake (PEB). Based on years of experience with spin-on type Inpria MOR, we have designed a new PEB oven to achieve contamination mitigation, while keeping our high standard of CDU. The new bake oven was introduced in our coater and developer and evaluated using line/space patterns. As described in the results, exceptional CD uniformity was realized while exceeding the metal contamination specification. The new plate design also enabled a 30% reduction in dose-to-size without degradation of CDU when applying higher PEB temperature. Another challenge for the DRAM application in particular is pattern collapse as applied to pillar patterns. By optimization of several parameters, the pattern collapse margin extended the minimum CD by 13.8%. The result was achieved with a combination of SiC in place of SOG for under layer, thinner resist film thickness and a modified resist material, MOR-B. Finally, to achieve target yield performance, defectivity reduction is also an important task towards MOR application. An integrated approach is needed to realize scum free patterning because if metal residuals remain in the open space, they can cause yield-killing defects. By analyzing possible root causes of defect sources, we attempt to eliminate etch-masking scum layer present after conventional developer processing. By applying a post develop rinse including novel hardware for defect reduction, bridge defects were reduced up to 19% with new the technology.", "The application of metal-oxide resist (MOR) for mass production is highly expected since MOR has an advantage of higher resolution. However, the metal components itself has a high risks of metal contamination and the defects based on metal components. Therefore, control of defects is more important than conventional chemically amplified resist (CAR). In this paper, reduction of defect densities are examined by latest technologies in the coater/developer. As results, on pillar pattern, many fall-on and scum defects were observed and majority of them were transferred to underlayer by etching process. In order to reduce the fall-on and the scum defects, three possible solutions were proposed. First, the latest resist supply system was designed for MOR. In addition, particles emitted from the latest supply system was reduced compared to the conventional system. Second, improvement of purity of the developer solution contributed to the reduction of fall-on particles. Third, application of the optimized rinse after development reduced 12% of the scum defect on the pillar pattern after lithography. It contributed to 19% (single bridge) and 18% (multi bridge) reduction after etching process. Furthermore, the optimized rinse reduced the single bridges on the line and space (L/S) pattern by 14% after etching process. These proposed three technologies are expected to be utilized for high volume manufacturing.", "Stochasticity is a major contributor to the resolution limit of fine mechanics and optical imaging, which is also an obstacle for achieving cutting edge EUV lithography performance. The root cause of stochasticity comes from the pattern edge random variation within the resist after exposure due to low contrast. High substrate adhesion is also very fatal as it further aggravates the variation at the substrate due to increased interaction, leading to stochastic failures. In this paper, Stochastic Area Thickness (SAT) and Dynamic Stochastic Area Thickness (DSAT) are used to evaluate the stochastic interactions. High optical foot exposure is proposed instead of conventional low substrate reflectivity to reduce SAT. Adhesion control by acid/quencher loading is proposed to minimize the stochastic interaction between resist and substrate.", "Defect source reduction in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) photoresists is a critical requirement to improve device performance and overall yield for a seamless transition to high volume manufacturing, especially for technologies in the 3 nm node and beyond. This is particularly true considering the increased influence of stochastic imaging defectivity in EUV relative to prior lithographic technologies. Filtration is one of the key enabling technologies to maintain a material\u2019s purity and therefore enhance process performance, beginning when the photoresist is manufactured, and continuing until the photoresist is dispensed on a wafer. We have previously presented a novel filtration technology development to maximize filtration efficiency for specific contamination sources and reduce defectivity in EUV photoresists. In this paper, further results and possible defect reduction mechanisms will be updated and discussed to address stochastic issues, specially variability of polymer molecular weight distribution in EUV CAR (Chemically Amplified Resists) photoresists.", "We discuss the importance of resist loss in resist calibration under multi-patterns and put it into resist calibration flow. The work is based on the exposure-focus data matrix which includes a mass of CD values obtained by experiments with step-variation setting of exposure and focus in ArF lithography. We focus on the Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) between experiments and simulations for calibration. The model after calibration with only CD values including could predict that the RMS is low to 2nm for single pattern, and to 5nm for several pattern. However, the cross section image predicted by the aforementioned model is not correspond with the experiment scan imagery. The resist loss adding to flow could improve that and increase the model predictability. Most importantly, it will be shown that calibrated resist models based on several patterns data could predict the resist profile of the other patterns.", "EUV chemically amplified resists (CAR) use a copolymer containing highly-polar poly hydroxy styrene (PHS), which is believed to easily aggregate and form gel-like polymers. These aggregates likely generate microbridge defects, an important yield detractor in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing. Improvements in EUV photoresist quality and a reduction in on wafer defectivity require more selective removal for this specific contamination source. Earlier presentations have demonstrated the benefit of effective removal of gel-like polymers in ArF immersion photoresists using photochemical filters with functionalized membrane technology [1]. In this paper we introduce a new filter technology for gel-like polymer removal in EUV photoresists. This contamination control technology demonstrates improved efficiency for removing partial, highly polar chemicals and fine particles that cause gel-like polymers over previous filter generations. The filter also improves on wafer defect counts.", "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is an indispensable device in inspection of photoresist and etched Si patterns. On the other hand, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation offers high resolution in lithography fabrication. Owing to the application of EUV, the feature size of photomask produced by electron beam (EB) lithography is reduced as well. The reduction of feature size made the information extraction from SEM image difficult due to the technical limitation. This proceeding reports a strategy to extract the information of line-and-space pattern. The main step classification of line, space and edge class was realized by unsupervised machine learning \u2013 hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering can integrate the brightness and coordination information in classification, and thus the classification ability of it is better than image thresholding. Furthermore, the classification result was used in prediction for etching pattern. The precision and recall of prediction were verified by confusion matrix.", "Continuous shrinking of semiconductor manufacturing node requires smaller critical dimension (CD) and higher pattern density, but also a better control of pattern local variability such as local CD uniformity (CDU). Thus, improving the process stability has been shown to improve local variability. Shrinking makes also crucial to control the process-specific patterned defectivity, with a more demanding defect detection and removal effort, which will depend on the mask level and stack materials. Therefore, integrating a new process in a recently installed immersion lithography cluster requires a thorough study of the influence of the track parameters in the specific process flow, as well as the use of last generation optical defectivity inspection, review and classification tools. In this work, we present the main results in the cooptimization of CD control, CD uniformity and after development inspection (ADI) of defectivity in a PTD immersion lithography process. The mask used is a gate layer targeting 42nm dense lines using a trilayer with topcoat lithographic stack.", "Removing metallic contaminants from the photochemical supply chain is critical for the creation of high yielding, highly reliable semiconductors. Metallic contaminants may lead to various types of defects, such as cone defects, that can result in significant yield loss and degraded long-term reliability. This makes control of metallic contaminants even more critical in advanced photolithography processes, where the device reliability demands metal contaminants at parts per trillion (ppt) levels. Previous work3 demonstrated the ability of two purifiers, PurasolTM SP and SN, to reduce the metal contaminants in a variety of organic solvents. In this paper we will discuss our continued work to reduce contamination sources that can contribute to defect formation in photolithography applications.", "Still acknowledged as a peculiarly challenging module, the Dual Damascene (DD) in via-first approach is constantly the object of an improvement effort, through many ways: I) testing new materials, II) tuning the coating/baking recipes and III) varying the scanner illumination conditions. The extensive characterization involved, in this case, a KrF 4-layer stack, in which the under-layer gained the role of both vias-filler and flattening material, thanks to the evaluation of many parameters like the introduction of a multi-bake route and the variation of the film thickness. The stack, customized to guarantee the etch feasibility, implied: the usage of a hard mask to allow the digging selectivity, a Bottom-Anti-Reflective-Coating (BARC) to avoid any back-reflection coming from the Silicon oxide substrate and the PhotoResist (PhR) on top. Evaluating different illumination modes, this study demonstrated how the tuning of the Numerical Aperture (NA) and of the \u03c3 values can be a feasible solution to decrease the swing effect entity; being it responsible, in most cases, for large dimensional variations when encountering small film thickness intra-die biases. Process Window (PW) and Depth of Focus (DoF) were analyzed thanks to the usage of properly designed test vehicles, to check the definition of the expected structural dimensions. This gave the opportunity to improve the Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU), always remaining a key topic, especially when dealing with devices addressed to the automotive market.", "Selective etching of several hard-to-etch materials is achieved by cyclic repetition of conversion into volatile organometallics followed by volatilization. A feature of this etching technology is the processes of adding volatility to these materials by converting the surface of the materials into intermediatory generated organometallics with thermal stability; one key point is stabilizing materials for the organometallics, and the other is a reaction pathway via inherently stable organometallics. In layers of Co metal, one hard-to-etch material, a specific oxidation state of Co in the Co oxidizing first step avoids the reaction pathways that generate a mixture of multiple organo-cobalt complexes in the following step. For La2O3, another hard-to-etch material, an organo-lanthanum complex generated in the ligand adsorbing first step is immediately stabilized by a stabilizer. The surface-modified layer composed of the resultant stabilized organo-lanthanum complex prevents the ligand species from diffusing deeply and from increasing the modified layer thickness. The following step, in both cases, is rapid thermal annealing by infrared (IR) irradiation to remove the surface modified layer without decomposition. The etched amount increases as the number of cycle repetitions increases with high selectivity.", "Through\u2010silicon via etch (TSV) is critical to current and future advanced packaging schemes. For heterogeneous integration approaches in particular, where modular components are tightly packed together, these processes play an integral role. While etch processes for silicon appear well understood and the frontiers of plasma etch have led us to advanced cyclic processes for device fabrication such as atomic layer etching, TSV applications are fundamentally different due to their relative size and aspect ratio targets. Unlike small-scale etching, TSV feature etching has not shown exponential change over time. To achieve TSV targets such as high etch rate, high aspect ratio, and clean profiles to support filling, known solutions are employed such as cryogenic wafer temperatures, alternative hard mask schemes, and extremely short gas cycle times; these solutions require specialized equipment and/or a more complex integration scheme. We explore the creation of high-aspect ratio, diffusion-limited TSV etches with high PR selectivity (<50:1) and high aspect ratios while simultaneously aiming for a high etch rate all while using non-cryogenic temperatures and a standard photoresist mask. A focus on sidewall profile and sidewall damage is maintained.", "In this work, we present two different approaches to pattern Ru metal lines at a metal pitch of 18 nm, by making use of self-aligned double patterning (SADP) in combination with EUV lithography. The first and more conventional patterning approach is to define the 18 nm pitch gratings into a hard mask by means of SADP, which is consequently transferred into the Ru layer by means of direct metal etch. The second and more innovative approach consists of a combination of direct metal etch and damascene filling of Ru. This so-called mixed flow is a patterning-friendly approach which enables the integration of self-aligned cuts and vias. We will share the schematics as well as the results for 18 nm pitch Ru gratings on 300 mm Si wafers for both approaches. Finally, we will discuss and demonstrate the enablement of selfaligned cuts and vias for the mixed flow, which makes this patterning flow a promising alternative to standard damascene patterning for future interconnects at sub-20 nm metal pitches.", "As technology nodes continue to scale down, maintaining roughness and defectivity during the pattern transfer becomes more challenging. For the smallest features, Metal-Organic Resists (MOR) are preferred due to their better selectivity than Chemically Amplified Resists (CAR). However, MORs are usually negative tone resists. Primarily based on defectivity reasons, dark field Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) masks are strongly preferred over light field EUV masks. Therefore, the MOR resist is more suited for pillar patterning than hole patterning. The purpose of this paper is to show that exposing pillars with MOR and converting them into holes can yield better roughness and defectivity than patterning holes with CAR directly. A similar comparison is done for the tone reversal of lines and spaces. It is shown that the Local Critical Dimension Uniformity (LCDU) of holes and the Line Edge Roughness (LER) of lines/spaces are well conserved throughout the tone inversion process.", "Selective plasma etching among different dielectric materials is crucial to the manufacturing of advanced logic and memory devices. For instance, in self-aligned contact (SAC) etching, achieving highly selective SiO2 etching over Si3N4 is essential. By contrast, in self-aligned multi-patterning (SAMP), selective Si3N4 spacer removal over SiO2 and Si is necessary. To effectively control the relative etch rates of various dielectric materials, etch gas chemistry optimization [for instance, see J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 36, 040601 (2018), J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 34, 041307 (2016)., J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 35, 01A102 (2017), etc.] has been extensively investigated. On the other hand, hardware capabilities such as direct current superposition (DCS) and must also be considered for their effects on plasma physics and plasma-surface interactions. In this study, we examine the etch behavior for various dielectric materials e.g. SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k dielectrics in a TEL dual-frequency CCP chamber. Specifically, we focus on the gas ratio and DCS effects in a CF4/H2/Ar plasma. Contrary to the monotonically decreasing etch rates for SiO2 and low-k vs. increasing H2/CF4 flow ratio in accordance with decreasing F/CFx density ratio, the experimental blanket Si3N4 etch rate exhibits a local maximum at H2/(CF4+H2) = 15%. Chamber-scale plasma simulations using the Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM) indicate that the HF density is peaked at almost the same gas ratio. In addition, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal hydrogen\u2019s role in modifying the Si3N4 surface through N-H bond formation, thereby creating a hydrophilic surface on which HF adsorption is enhanced. Finally, computed reactant flux trends also demonstrate that the effect of DC superposition (DCS) on the relative orders of various ion and neutral reactant fluxes to the wafer is significantly weaker compared to that of the H2/(CF4+H2) flow ratio. This suggests that the application of DCS aimed at differential charging mitigation is not expected to induce major changes in inherent material etch selectivity. These fundamental learnings provide insights to guide process development and optimization for common dielectric etch applications.", "This paper demonstrates a full-chip OPC correction flow based on deep-learning etch model in a DUV litho-etch case. The flow leverages SEM metrology (eP5 fast E-beam tool, ASML-HMI) to collect massive data, automated metrology software (MXP, ASML-Brion) to extract high quality gauges, and deep-learning etch modeling (Newron etch, ASML-Brion) to capture complicated etch behaviors. The model calibration and verification are performed using a combined data from a test and real chip wafer to ensure sufficient pattern coverage. The model performance of Newron etch is benchmarked against a term-based etch model, wherein Newron etch model shows significant accuracy improvement in the model calibration (<50% for test patterns and <35% for real chip pattern). The Newron etch model is proven stable with a comparable performance in the model verification. Particularly, strong loading effects from underlying sublayer are observed in the full chip wafer, and effectively captured by the Newron etch with a sublayer-aware model form. The calibrated Newron etch model is successfully applied in a model-based etch OPC tape-out with new mask design rules but the same litho-etch process conditions. Compared to the term-based model, Newron etch also shows significant accuracy improvement.", "The development of new technologies and advanced nodes is capitally intensive due to process design strategies that involve dependent unit processes with different yields and performances. This has led to the exploration of model-based optimization to cut the cost and time of recipe creation; however, computational optimization of semiconductor processes is quite challenging due to multi-dimensional parameter spaces and limited experimental data. SandBox Studio\u2122 AI is a computational tool that automatically builds a hybrid physics-based and machine learning model that can be used to predict optimal process recipes and explore novel process changes such as different incoming mask geometries and step durations. Herein, we show the utilization of SandBox Studio\u2122 AI to build a computational representation of a cyclic etch and deposition process of a high aspect ratio channel etch with the following detrimental effects \u2013 bowing, resist over-etching, clogging via deposition, and twisting. The model was calibrated to a synthetic data set of thirteen experiments with five varying process parameters. Then, an optimal recipe was predicted that minimized the observed detrimental effects. The model was then used to explore different incoming mask geometries and step durations to improve the recipe even further. This capability is made possible by the software\u2019s foundational physics-based model and is not possible using conventional statistics and machine learning based tools.", "Switching of phase change memory (PCM) materials between crystalline and amorphous phase with electrical pulses and optical properties make it an important candidate for storage class memory and neuromorphic computing. However, PCM materials can be sensitive to air exposure during integration, therefore in-vacuo RIE and encapsulation is important to provide the required oxygen diffusion barrier. Low temperature SiN deposition can be used for low thermal budget integration schemes provided a good film conformality is achieved and damage or etching to the PCM elements is mitigated. In this work, ammonia- (NH3-) free, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) SiN films deposited at 40\u00b0C (microwave plasma) and 200\u00b0C (inductively coupled plasma), are compared and wet etch rates and optical properties are evaluated. NH3-free SiN films were deposited using SiH4, N2, H2, and Ar as source gases. Tuning the plasma parameters during encapsulation we observed simultaneous selective etching of GST and controlled SiN film deposition. Hydrogen and argon addition to the plasma mixture provided the main control knob for in-situ GST trimming during deposition, avoiding any type of elemental or structural damage to the GST films.", "In this talk we present core technology solutions for EUV Patterning and co-optimization between EUV resist and underlayer coating, development and plasma etch transfer to achieve best in class patterning performance. We will introduce new hardware and process innovations to address EUV stochastic issues, and present strategies that can extend into High NA EUV patterning. A strong focus will be placed on dose reduction opportunities, thin resist enablement and resist pattern collapse mitigation technologies. CAR and MOR performance for leading edge design rules will be showcased. As the first High NA EUV scanner is scheduled to be operational in 2023 in the joint high NA lab in Veldhoven, Tokyo Electron will collaborate closely with imec, ASML and our materials partners to accelerate High NA learning and support EUV roadmap extension.", "As conventional pitch scaling is saturating, scaling boosters such as buried power rail (BPR) [1-4] and its extension to backside power delivery (BSPDN) [5, 6] could provide 20% and 30% area gain [7], respectively. BPR can also help to improve SRAM design [8] and is a building block in novel architectures such as CFET [9, 10], for technology scaling beyond the 3 nm CMOS node. The two main features of BPR technology include: (i) the introduction of BPR metal within the fin module (fig. 1). Metal insertion in front-end-ofline (FEOL) has a risk of tool/wafer cross-contamination. Ensuring that BPR metal is fully encapsulated during contamination critical processes such as epitaxy, is therefore, essential. A proper choice of metal limits the risk of device performance/reliability degradation from metal diffusion & mechanical stress. (ii) The addition of VBPR via connections from M0A contact level to the BPR lines. Its challenges include high aspect ratio (AR) patterning, achieving low resistance (R) and reliable contact with BPR. This paper reports an overview of BPR/Via-to-BPR (VBPR) module development and metallization options at BPR and VBPR.", "Buried power rail (BPR), a novel integration approach for further device scaling, brings in new patterning needs and requirements, the most importantly, the challenging middle-of-line (MOL) patterning process steps. In this paper, some of the critical plasma dry etch development processing results for the FinFET device flow with BPR integrated are presented. Mainly, the study was focused on plasma dry etch development of high aspect ratio Via contact to BPR metal (VBPR) and Trench contact etch (M0A) to the source/drain (S/D) device region. We demonstrate the short-free M0A (no attack on the neighboring gates) contact etch to the S/D, with the high etch selectivity values obtained in case of the dielectric SiO2 trench etch to the thin Si3N4 liner (deposited over epitaxial S/D), and subsequently the high selectivity values during SiN liner etch to the underlying S/D (SiN liner etch results in 0nm epitaxial film loss). Patterning of high aspect ratio (HAR) Via consisting of the multi-stack, SiO2/SiN/SiO2/SiN dielectric, landing on the bottom BPR metal was achieved, with the target critical dimension (CD) required to avoid shorting to the adjacent gates. Additionally, we report our learnings on how choice of buried power metal (W, Ru and Mo) impacts the etch requirements, i.e., the etch challenges associated by using Ru and Mo as a replacement for standardly used W metal.", "In order to fully utilize the potential of the latest and greatest scanner overlay performance capability in a manufacturing environment, all other (process-induced) overlay contributors should be well understood and eliminated where possible. While overlay penalties that slowly vary across the wafer and/or within each exposure field can easily be corrected with the available scanner correction knobs, this is less likely going to happen for overlay signatures that manifest themselves on a much shorter length scale. We refer to length scales that are comparable to the floorplan of the integrated circuit itself. A deep understanding of these process induced overlay contributions is required to take away their root causes. Several non-scanner overlay contributors are known that may have an impact on the scanner exposure field overlay performance. Of course, the quality of the mask itself plays an important role. Mask writing errors correlate one-to-one with the on-wafer overlay performance. Local stress effects may contribute to the intra-die overlay performance too. We extensively addressed the layer stress impact on the intra-field overlay in an earlier publication. In that work, an interesting observation was made. The etch-induced overlay contribution turned out to be largely independent of the layer stress in which the pattern was etched. The conclusion was drawn that the etch-induced overlay penalties can be optimized separately from layer stress related overlay effects. In this work, the focus will be on the etch-induced overlay penalties only. We addressed the etch-induced overlay impact already before. Surprisingly, the etch-induced overlay penalties showed up in every exposure field despite the fact that the etch tool itself is not exposure field aware. For the use-case we investigated, the magnitude of the etch-induced intra-field overlay penalty was around 1-nm. This comes close to the scanner baseline overlay performance. A relation was found with the pattern density distribution and a dependency with the etch tool settings was observed. We identified the Spin-On-Glass and/or Spin-On-Carbon (Hard Mask) etch as the potential root cause. A hypothesis was proposed that was in line with the experimental observations. In this experimental work, we have continued the investigation by validating the hypothesis proposed earlier. Since the hypothesis was based on the pattern density distribution within the exposure field in combination with the deflection of ions due to surface charging effects, both the mask and the etch tool recipe settings per layer have been changed. We show that the etch-induced intra-field overlay penalties can indeed be controlled by changing the etch tool recipe settings per layer. However, the underlying mechanism turned out to be different from what we expected. In the current paper, we will present a new concept that much better explains all the experimental results we have obtained so far. Based on this new understanding, we experimentally demonstrate that etch-induced intra-field overlay penalties can be mitigated by optimizing the etch tool recipe settings.", "Identification of optimal recipes for multi-step and cyclic etch processes where the outcome of each step depends on the progression of the previous steps is a major challenge. Selecting the order and duration of each step is typically performed by a tedious trial and error process where the number of experimental trials scales exponentially with process complexity. Here we present a simulation-based methodology that significantly accelerates the process. We use limited experimental data taken at various process conditions, which may include pressure, gas type, gas flow rate, power, bias, and time to calibrate a step-aware reduced-order physics-based etch and deposition model. This model is used to generate predictions with steps permuted in any desired order and duration. The calibrated model predicts ordering, timing, and possible cycling of each step to achieve desired etch targets. The methodology is demonstrated on a multilayer stack with three possible steps, including etch and deposition. It is shown that the total number of experiments required for the proposed methodology is significantly less than that required by standard methods like full-factorial design of experiment. We also demonstrate how the etch data and the resulting calibrated model can be used to determine the optimal etch recipe for different aperture and/or mask geometries without having to perform further experiments.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has been used for mass production for several years. Now the resolution limit of current 0.33 NA single exposure has been approaching. To enhance the resolution limit, high NA exposure tool has been developing. At the limit, not only the stochastic failures1, but also patterning trade-off has been becoming challenging. In this paper, to overcome the patterning trade-off of LS and CH, several approaches were demonstrated for both CAR and MOR. As for chemically amplified resist (CAR), to overcome the patterning trade-off of line and space, two different approaches were demonstrated. One was a developer rinse process optimization, and the other was a top deposition treatment during etching process. By using the two approaches, pitch 24 nm LS patterns were successfully transferred. As to CAR CH patterning, a new shrink technique during etch process was successfully tested for sub 15 nm hole patterning. No missing hole detected at 12 nm hole size by voltage contrast metrology. For tighter nodes, spin-on metal oxide resist (MOR) have been considering to be used because it offers a series of advantages. It has high sensitivity and resolution because of its high photon absorption and simple reaction mechanism. It also inherently has a higher etch resistance which enables resist thickness thinner and collapse margin higher. Spin-on process of MOR is expect to contribute high productivity which is essential for high volume manufacturing (HVM). Because defect reduction is one of the key points to enable MOR process for HVM, continuous investigation of defect mitigation has been done. For pitch 32 nm LS, the mitigation was confirmed by fine optimization with the combination of the etch process and the implementation of new under layers. As to pitch 28nm line and space, optimized illumination gave better defect process windows. Moreover, a new wet developer process was successfully proposed to prevent pitch 36 nm hexagonal pillars collapse during wet development with 25% higher EUV sensitivity."], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
