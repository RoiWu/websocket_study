For high volume manufacturing of semiconductor devices, significant improvement of resolution and sensitivity is required for successful implementation of EUV resists. Performance requirements for such resists demand the development of entirely new resist platforms. Cornell University has intensely studied metal oxide nanoparticle photoresists with high sensitivity for EUV lithography applications. Zirconium oxide nanoparticles with PAG enabling sub 30nm line negative tone patterns at an EUV dose below 5 mJ/cm2 show one of the best EUV sensitivity results ever reported. In this paper, recent progress in metal oxide nanoparticle photoresist research will be discussed. Several studies regarding composition investigation and new metal element study are reported.", "This study describes the use of a novel ultra-high sensitive \u2018metal resist\u2019 for use in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Herein, the development of a metal resist has been studied for improving the sensitivity when using metal-containing non-chemically amplified resist materials; such materials are metal-containing organic\u2013inorganic hybrid compounds and are referred to as EUVL Infrastructure Development Center, Inc. (EIDEC) standard metal EUV resist (ESMR). The novel metal resist\u2019s ultra-high sensitivity has previously been investigated for use with electron beam (EB) lithography. The first demonstration of ESMR performance was presented in SPIE2015, where it was shown to achieve 17-nm lines with 1.5 mJ/cm2: equivalent in EUV lithography tool. The sensitivity of ESMR using EUV open-flame exposure was also observed to have the same high sensitivity as that when using EB lithography tool. Therefore, ESMR has been confirmed to have the potential of being used as an ultra-high sensitive EUV resist material. The metal-containing organic\u2013inorganic hybrid compounds and the resist formulations were investigated by measuring their sensitivity and line-width roughness (LWR) improvement. Furthermore, new processing conditions, such as new development and rinse procedures, are an extremely effective way of improving lithographic performance. In addition, the optimal dry-etching selective conditions between the metal resist and spin-on carbon (SOC) were obtained. The etched SOC pattern was successfully constructed from a stacked film of metal resist and SOC.", "Strong interest has recently developed among the researchers in the use of metals in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography photoresists [1, 2] aiming to simultaneously achieve the resolution, line-width roughness and sensitivity (RLS) requirements for 10nm technology node and below and have the highest productivity with low exposure dose requirements (below 20mJ/cm2). In this paper two different metal containing resists (MCR) are discussed: the first one uses metal oxide nanoparticles (NP) bonded with ligands as an alternative non chemically amplified EUV photoresist; the second one introduces a metal species (the sensitizer) into a conventional chemically amplified EUV photoresist. In both cases, the metal is added to the resist system to increase the absorption of EUV photons as well as increase the generation of secondary electrons, thereby making more effective use of the dose. The initial work is focused on manufacturing compatibility, concerning metal cross-contamination, outgassing and hydrides formation risk. Next, lithographic performance is evaluated with respect to the RLS requirements by patterning on NXE:3300 full field scanner exposure tool, with particular emphasis on the material stability of different formulations.. Finally, imaging results at different processing conditions are also reported and discussed.", "This paper proposes a promising approach to break the resolution (R), line-edge-roughness (LER), and sensitivity (S) trade-off (RLS trade-off) relationships that limit the ultimate lithographic performance of standard chemically amplified resists (CAR). This is accomplished in a process that uses a Photosensitized Chemically Amplified Resist (PSCAR) in combination with a flood-exposure in an in-line track connected to a pattern exposure tool. PSCAR is a modified CAR which contains a photosensitizer precursor (PP) in addition to other standard CAR components such as a protected polymer, a photo acid generator (PAG) and a quencher. In this paper, the PSCAR concept and the required conditions in resist formulation are carefully explained. In the PSCAR process, the sensitivity improvement is accomplished by PAG decomposition to selectively generate more acid at the pattern exposed areas during the flood exposure. The selective photosensitization happens through the excitation of the photosensitizer (PS) generated by the deprotection of the PP at the pattern exposed areas. A higher resist chemical gradient which leads to an improved resolution and lower LER values is also predicted using the PSCAR simulator. In the PSCAR process, the improved chemical gradient can be realized by dual acid quenching steps with the help of increased quencher concentration. Acid quenching first happens simultaneously with acid catalytic PP to PS reactions. As a result, a sharpened PS latent image is created in the PSCAR. This image is subsequently excited by the flood exposure creating additional acid products at the pattern exposed areas only. Much the same as in the standard CAR system, unnecessary acid present in the non-pattern exposed areas can be neutralized by the remaining quencher to therefore produce sharper acid latent images. EUV exposure results down to 15 nm half pitch (HP) line/space (L/S) patterns using a PSCAR resist indicate that the use of PSCAR has the potential to improve the sensitivity of the system while simultaneously improving the line-width-roughness (LWR) with added quencher and flood exposure doses. In addition, improved across-wafer critical dimension uniformity (CDU) is realized by the use of a PSCAR in combination with a flood exposure using pre \u03b1 UV exposure module.", "Negative-tone imaging (NTI) with EUV exposure has major advantages with respect to line-width roughness (LWR) and resolution due in part to polymer swelling and favorable dissolution mechanics. In NTI process, both resist and organic solvents play important roles in determining lithography performances. The present study describes novel chemically amplified resist materials based on NTI technology with EUV using a specific organic solvents. Lithographic performances of NTI process were described in this paper under exposures using ASML NXE:3300 EUV scanner at imec. It is emphasized that 14 nm hp was nicely resolved under exposure dose of 37 mJ/cm2 without any bridge and collapse, which are attributed to the low swelling character of NTI process. Although 13 nm hp resolution was potentially obtained, a pattern collapse still restricts its resolution in case coating resist film thickness is 40 nm. Dark mask limitation due mainly to mask defectivity issue makes NTI with EUV favorable approach for printing block mask to produce logic circuit. A good resolution of CD-X 21 nm/CD-Y 32 nm was obtained for block mask pattern using NTI with usable process window and dose of 49 mJ/cm2. Minimum resolution now reaches CD-X 17 nm / CD-Y 23 nm for the block. A 21 nm block mask resolution was not affected by exposure dose and explored toward low dose down to 18 mJ/cm2 by reducing quencher loading. In addition, there was a negligible amount of increase in LCDU for isolated dot pattern when decreasing exposure dose from 66 mJ/cm2 to 24 mJ/cm2. On the other hand, there appeared tradeoff relationship between LCDU and dose for dense dot pattern, indicating photon-shot noise restriction, but strong dependency on patterning features. Design to improve acid generation efficiency was described based on acid generation mechanism in traditional chemically amplified materials which contains photo-acid generator (PAG) and polymer. Conventional EUV absorber comprises of organic compounds is expected to have 1.6 times higher EUV absorption than polyhydroxystyrene based on calculation. However, observed value of acid amount was comparable or significantly worse than polyhydroxystyrene.", "EUV lithography has been desired as the leading technology for single nm half-pitch patterning. However, the source power, masks and resist materials still have critical issues for mass production. Especially in resist materials, RLS trade-off is the key issue. To overcome this issue, we are suggesting Dry Development Rinse Process (DDRP) and Materials (DDRM) as the pattern collapse mitigation approach. This DDRM can perform not only as pattern collapse free materials for fine pitch, but also as the etching hard mask against bottom layer (spin on carbon : SOC). In this paper, we especially propose new approaches to achieve high resolution around hp10nm. The key points of our concepts are 1) control PR profiles, 2) new solvent system to avoid chemical mixture, 3) high etching selective DDR materilas and 4) high planar DDR materials. This new DDRM technology can be the promising approach for hp10nm level patterning in N7/N5 and beyond.", "NXE:3300B scanners have been operational at customer sites since almost two years, and the NXE:3350B, the 4th generation EUV system, has started shipping at the end of 2015. All these exposure tools operate using MOPA pre-pulse source technology, which enabled significant productivity scaling, demonstrated at customers and at ASML. Having achieved the required throughput to support device development, the main priority of the ASML EUV program has shifted towards improving stability and availability. Continuous progresses in defectivity reduction and in the realization of a reticle pellicle are taking place at increased speed. Today\u2019s overlay and imaging results are in line with the requirements of 7nm logic devices; Matched Machine overlay to ArF immersion below 2.5 nm and full wafer CDU performance of less than 1.0nm are regularly achieved. The realization of an intensity loss-less illuminator and improvements in resist formulation are significant progress towards enabling the use of EUV technology for 5nm logic devices at full productivity. This paper will present an overview of the status of the ASML EUV program and product roadmap by reviewing the current performance and on-going developments in productivity, imaging, overlay and mask defectivity reduction.", "Inpria has developed a directly patternable metal oxide hard-mask as a robust, high-resolution photoresist for EUV lithography. In this paper we demonstrate the full integration of a baseline Inpria resist into an imec N7 BEOL block mask process module. We examine in detail both the lithography and etch patterning results. By leveraging the high differential etch resistance of metal oxide photoresists, we explore opportunities for process simplification and cost reduction. We review the imaging results from the imec N7 block mask patterns and its process windows as well as routes to maximize the process latitude, underlayer integration, etch transfer, cross sections, etch equipment integration from cross metal contamination standpoint and selective resist strip process. Finally, initial results from a higher sensitivity Inpria resist are also reported. A dose to size of 19 mJ/cm2 was achieved to print pillars as small as 21nm.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology is steadily reaching high volume manufacturing for 16nm half pitch node and beyond. However, some challenges, for example scanner availability and resist performance (resolution, CD uniformity (CDU), LWR, etch behavior and so on) are remaining. Advance EUV patterning on the ASML NXE:3300/ CLEAN TRACK LITHIUS Pro Z- EUV litho cluster is launched at imec, allowing for finer pitch patterns for L/S and CH. Tokyo Electron Ltd. and imec are continuously collabo rating to develop manufacturing quality POR processes for NXE:3300. TEL\u2019s technologies to enhance CDU, defectivity and LWR/LER can improve patterning performance. The patterning is characterized and optimized in both litho and etch for a more complete understanding of the final patterning performance. This paper reports on post-litho CDU improvement by litho process optimization and also post-etch LWR reduction by litho and etch process optimization.", "The improvement of overlay control in extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography is one of critical issues for successful mass production by using it. Especially it is important to improve the mix and match overlay or matched machine overlay (MMO) between EUV and ArF immersion tool, because EUV process will be applied to specific layers that have more competitive cost edge against ArF immersion multiple patterning with the early mass productivity of EUVL. Therefore it is necessary to consider the EUV overlay target with comparing the overlay specification of double patterning technology (DPT) and spacer patterning technology (SPT). This paper will discuss about required overlay controllability and current performance of EUV, and challenges for future improvement.", "The non-zero chief ray angle at the object (CRAO) in EUVL systems introduces azimuthally asymmetric phase shifts. Understanding and characterizing these effects is critical to EUVL system and mask design. The effects of 3D mask absorber geometry on diffraction phase were examined through rigorous simulation. The diffraction phase distribution was split into even and odd components to enable analogies between the well-known effects of lens aberrations and EUV 3D mask effects. Specifically, this analysis reveals that the odd component of the phase distribution is non-zero in off-axis optical systems. We have found that 3D mask effects in EUVL systems can be partially compensated in the pupil plane to minimize aerial image effects, such as best focus shifts, horizontal-vertical CD bias, and image placement error.", "In Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, to enhance the wafer printing performance, a black border surrounding the patterned EUV mask is suggested. In this study, influence of the black border formed on the EUV mask on the image quality captured by electron beam (EB) microscope was investigated. First, we prepared EUV masks with etched multilayer black border. The electrical conductivity between inside and outside of the black border was controlled by inserting a conductive layer before coating the multilayer. By forming the black border the EUV reflectivity was suppressed about 70 % compared with the EUV mask without the black border. Next, the influence of the electrical conductivity on the EB microscope images was investigated using two types of EB microscopes. One was an EB microscope that does not employ retarding method. The other was an EB microscope that employs retarding method to accelerate the secondary electrons from the surface of the EUV mask to the sensor plane. The retarding voltage was supplied to the outside of the black border. By applying the conductive layer, degradation of the image quality was not observed regardless of whether the EB microscopes employ the retarding method or not.", "EUV lithography uses reflective photomasks to print features on a wafer through the formation of an aerial image. The aerial image is influenced by the mask\u2019s substrate and pattern roughness and by photon shot noise, which collectively affect the line-width on wafer prints, with an impact on local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU). We have used SHARP, an actinic mask-imaging microscope, to study line-width roughness (LWR) in aerial images at sub-nanometer resolution. We studied the impact of photon density and the illumination partial coherence on recorded images, and found that at low coherence settings, the line-width roughness is dominated by photon noise, while at high coherence setting, the effect of speckle becomes more prominent, dominating photon noise for exposure levels of 4 photons/nm2 at threshold on the mask size.", "The absorption of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) pellicle could be the most critical problem because the EUV source power is still not good enough for achieving mass production. We found that the transmission loss due to the EUV pellicle could be compensated through proper optical proximity correction (OPC) of a pellicled mask. Patterning results of OPCed masks with different transmission pellicles are shown for various 1D and 2D patterns. From the results, it is clearly shown that we do not need to increase the dose to avoid the throughput loss even if a pellicle which has 80 % one-pass transmission is used. Therefore, the EUV pellicle manufacturing would be much easier because we can use much thicker film with higher absorption.", "We have been developing CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source which is the most promising solution as the 13.5nm high power light source for HVM EUVL since 2003. Unique original technologies such as; combination of pulsed CO2 laser and Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser pulse shooting and mitigation with magnetic field have been developed in Gigaphoton Inc.. The theoretical and experimental data have clearly showed the advantage of our proposed strategy. We demonstrated 108W EUV power (I/F clean in burst), 80 kHz, 24 hours stable operation at Proto#2 device. Based on these experimental data we are now constructing first practical source for HVM; \u201cGL200E-Pilot#1\u201d. Target of this device is 250 W EUV power by 27 kW pulsed CO2 driver laser system.", "We present highlights from plasma simulations performed in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Labs. This modeling is performed to advance the rate of learning about optimal EUV generation for laser produced plasmas and to provide insights where experimental results are not currently available. The goal is to identify key physical processes necessary for an accurate and predictive model capable of simulating a wide range of conditions. This modeling will help to drive source performance scaling in support of the EUV Lithography roadmap. The model simulates pre-pulse laser interaction with the tin droplet and follows the droplet expansion into the main pulse target zone. Next, the interaction of the expanded droplet with the main laser pulse is simulated. We demonstrate the predictive nature of the code and provide comparison with experimental results.", "High-throughput and -resolution actinic mask inspection tools are needed as EUVL begins to enter into volume production phase. To realize such inspection tools, a high-radiance EUV source is necessary. Ushio\u2019s laser-assisted discharge-produced plasma (LDP) source is able to meet industry\u2019s requirements in radiance, cleanliness, stability and reliability. Ushio\u2019s LDP source has shown the peak radiance at plasma of 180 W/mm2/sr and the area-averaged radiance in a 200-\u03bcm-diameter circle behind the debris mitigation system of 120 W/mm2/sr. A new version of the debris mitigation system is in testing phase. Its optical transmission was confirmed to be 73 %, which is 4 % lower than that of the previous version and therefore will be improved. Cleanliness of the system is evaluated by exposing Ru mirrors placed behind the debris mitigation system. Ru sputter rate was proven to be sufficiently low as 3~5 nm/Gpulse at 7 kHz, whereas frequency-dependent sputter rate was 1~3 nm/Gpulse at 5~9 kHz as previously reported. Sn deposition remained very low (< 0.05 nm) and did not grow over time. A new technique to suppress debris was tested and preliminary results were promising. Time-of-flight signal of fast ions was completely suppressed and Ru sputter rate of exposed mirrors at 3 kHz was approximately 1.3 nm/Gpulse, whereas the conventional mitigation system (new version) resulted in Ru sputter rate of 0.7 nm/Gpulse. This new technique also allows increasing the radiance efficiency by 30 %. Stability tests were done at several different discharge frequencies. Pulse energy stability was approximately 10 %. Dose energy stability dropped from approximately 2 % to 0.1 % when feedback control was activated. EUV emission position stability was studied at 3 kHz. Deviation of the plasma center of gravity was 6 \u03bcm, which is 3 % of plasma diameter and therefore considered to be negligible. Reliability tests were performed on both R and D and prototype machines and up to 200 hours of non-interrupted operation was demonstrated.", "An in-situ hydrogen plasma cleaning technique to clean Sn off of EUV collector optics is studied in detail. The cleaning process uses hydrogen radicals (formed in the hydrogen plasma) to interact with Sn-coated surfaces, forming SnH4 and being pumped away. This technique has been used to clean a 300mm-diameter stainless steel dummy collector optic, and EUV reflectivity of multilayer mirror samples was restored after cleaning Sn from them, validating the potential of this technology. This method has the potential to significantly reduce downtime and increase source availability. However, net Sn removal is limited by decomposition of the SnH4 molecule upon impact with the collector and the resulting redeposition of Sn. This is true in all cleaning systems that make use of hydrogen radicals. Thus, to guide the design of effective cleaning systems, the transport of Sn in the chamber, and the fundamental processes affecting it, must be understood. Accordingly, an investigation into these processes Sn removal is being performed. These processes include the advection of gas through the chamber, the creation of hydrogen radicals, the etching of Sn by radicals, and the surface decomposition of SnH4. In this paper, experiments to determine the radical density are presented, along with a theoretical plasma chemistry model that explains the processes behind radical creation and validates the radical density measurements. Additionally, experiments are shown that provide an insight into the etching of Sn by hydrogen radicals, yielding calculations of etching probability as well as showing that Sn etching is very sensitive to oxygen contamination and surface morphology.", "The power consumption in the two-pulse bispectral primary source could be substantially decreased by replacing the SRS converters from 1.06 \u03bcm into 10.6 \u03bcm wavelength as the preamplifier cascades in \u0421\u041e2 laser channel at the same efficiency radiation of EUV source. The creation of high volume manufacturing lithography facilities with the technological standard of 10-20 nm is related to the implementation of resist exposure modes with pulse repetition rate of 100 kHz. Low power consumption of the proposed scheme makes it promising for the creation of LPP EUV sources.", "In this work we present the capabilities of the designed and realized extreme ultraviolet laboratory exposure tool (EUVLET) which has been developed at the RWTH-Aachen, Chair for the Technology of Optical Systems (TOS), in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology (ILT) and Bruker ASC GmbH. Main purpose of this laboratory setup is the direct application in research facilities and companies with small batch production, where the fabrication of high resolution periodic arrays over large areas is required. The setup can also be utilized for resist characterization and evaluation of its pre- and post-exposure processing. The tool utilizes a partially coherent discharge produced plasma (DPP) source and minimizes the number of other critical components to a transmission grating, the photoresist coated wafer and the positioning system for wafer and grating and utilizes the Talbot lithography approach. To identify the limits of this approach first each component is analyzed and optimized separately and relations between these components are identified. The EUV source has been optimized to achieve the best values for spatial and temporal coherence. Phase-shifting and amplitude transmission gratings have been fabricated and exposed. Several commercially available electron beam resists and one EUV resist have been characterized by open frame exposures to determine their contrast under EUV radiation. Cold development procedure has been performed to further increase the resist contrast. By analyzing the exposure results it can be demonstrated that only a 1:1 copy of the mask structure can be fully resolved by the utilization of amplitude masks. The utilized phase-shift masks offer higher 1st order diffraction efficiency and allow a demagnification of the mask structure in the achromatic Talbot plane.", "The argon cusp plasma has been introduced [1,2] for 500W class tin LPP exhaust control in view of its high power handling, predicted low tin back-scatter from a beam dump, and avoidance of hydrogen usage. The physics of tin ion control by a plasma is first discussed. Experimentally, cusp stability and exhaust disc geometry have previously been proved at full scale [2], the equivalent of 300W-500W usable EUV. Here we verify operation of the plasma barrier that maintains a high argon density next to the collector, for its protection, and a low density in the long path toward the intermediate focus, for efficiency. A pressure differential of 2Pa has been demonstrated in initial work. Other aspects of tin LPP plasma control by the cusp have now been demonstrated using tin ions from a low Hz 130mJ CO2 laser pulse onto a solid tin surface at the cusp center. Plasma is rejected at the <0.5% level at the collector mirror location using the cusp magnetic field alone. Plasma also is rejected using a low argon density (<1x1014cm-3). We have measured the tin ion flow pattern toward the large area annular beam dump. Scaling of the cusp design to match a specified exhaust power is discussed. In view of this work, argon cusp exhaust control appears to be very promising for 500W class tin LPP sources.", "As the semiconductor industry proceeds to develop ever better sources of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light for photolithography applications, two distinct technologies have come to prominence: Tin-plasma and free electron laser (FEL) sources. Tin plasma sources have been in development within the industry for many years, and have been widely reported. Meanwhile, FELs represent the most promising alternative to create high power EUV frequencies and, while tin-plasma source development has been ongoing, such lasers have been continuously developed by academic institutions for use in fundamental research programmes in conjunction with universities and national scientific institutions. This paper follows developments in the field of academic FELs, and presents information regarding novel technologies, specifically in the area of RF design strategy, that may be incorporated into future industrial FEL systems for EUV lithography in order to minimize the necessary investment and operational costs. It goes on to try to assess the cost-benefit of an alternate RF design strategy, based upon previous studies.", "The need to print smaller features and tighter pitches drives the development of new photolithography technologies. Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) at 13.5 nm wavelength is expected to provide considerable resolution gain over the current technology based on 193 nm wavelength. In this paper we assess the current status of EUV photoresists and their readiness for EUVL insertion into High Volume Manufacturing (HVM). In addition, we discuss the requirements that EUV photoresists will need to satisfy in the near and long term future.", "EUV lithographers have continued to reduce the barriers to high Volume Manufacturing (HVM) introduction. Tool, mask and photoresist manufacturers have made excellent progress on several fronts, including resolution of many EUV source related issues, resists for early imaging characterization, and defect inspection tooling. In this discussion, we will focus on photoresist development. For many years, the team at SUNY Polytechnic Institute (SUNY Poly) has provided results from a neutral photoresist benchmarking study, which has been quite useful in establishing the limits of currently available photoresist systems [1-5]. New photoresist systems are being developed with improving resolution, but they also have lower coated thicknesses. In an effort to continue to point out potential lithographic problem areas, SUNY Poly has been evaluating the \u2018etch compatibility\u2019 of the best performing photoresists available in order to determine if the decreasing aspect ratios would prove a detriment to etch performance. In this paper, we will show data from our most recent benchmark study. We will also include smoothing process results, as well as some post-etch results obtained using the NXE:3300B resident on the SUNY Poly campus.", "Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) lithography is one of the most promising candidate technologies for the high-volume manufacturing (HVM) of semiconductor devices at the sub-14 nm half pitch lines and spaces (LS) pattern for 7 nm node and beyond. EUV resists is strongly required high resolution (R) with high sensitivity (S) and low line edge/ width roughness (L) for HVM application. Experimental results on chemically amplified (CA) resist will be shown to study the influence of proton source, photo acid generator (PAG) cation and the other materials on lithographic performance, and then resist formulation designed for improving RLS trade-off will be discussed.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL, \u03bb = 13.5 nm) is the most promising candidate to manufacture electronic devices for future technology nodes in the semiconductor industry. Nonetheless, EUVL still faces many technological challenges as it moves toward high-volume manufacturing (HVM). A key bottleneck from the tool design and performance point of view has been the development of an efficient, high power EUV light source for high throughput production. Consequently, there has been extensive research on different methodologies to enhance EUV resist sensitivity. Resist performance is measured in terms of its ultimate printing resolution, line width roughness (LWR), sensitivity (S or best energy BE) and exposure latitude (EL). However, there are well-known fundamental trade-off relationships (LRS trade-off) among these parameters for chemically amplified resists (CARs). Here we present early proof-of-principle results for a multi-exposure lithography process that has the potential for high sensitivity enhancement without compromising other important performance characteristics by the use of a Photosensitized Chemically Amplified Resist (PSCAR). With this method, we seek to increase the sensitivity by combining a first EUV pattern exposure with a second UV flood exposure (\u03bb = 365 nm) and the use of a PSCAR. In addition, we have evaluated over 50 different state-of-the-art EUV CARs. Among these, we have identified several promising candidates that simultaneously meet sensitivity, LWR and EL high performance requirements with the aim of resolving line space (L/S) features for the 7 and 5 nm logic node (16 nm and 13 nm half-pitch HP, respectively) for HVM. Several CARs were additionally found to be well resolved down to 12 nm and 11 nm HP with minimal pattern collapse and bridging, a remarkable feat for CARs. Finally, the performance of two negative tone state-of-the-art alternative resist platforms previously investigated was compared to the CAR performance at and below 16 nm HP resolution, demonstrating the need for alternative resist solutions at 13 nm resolution and below. EUV interference lithography (IL) has provided and continues to provide a simple yet powerful platform for academic and industrial research enabling the characterization and development of new resist materials before commercial EUV exposure tools become available. Our experiments have been performed at the EUV-IL set-up in the Swiss Light Source (SLS) synchrotron facility located at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI).", "Conventional photoresist processing involves resist coating, exposure, post-exposure bake, development, rinse and spin drying of a wafer. DDRP mitigates pattern collapse by applying a special polymer material (DDRM) which replaces the exposed/developed part of the photoresist material before wafer is spin dried. As noted above, the main mechanism of pattern collapse is the capillary forces governed by surface tension of rinse water and its asymmetrical recession from both sides of the lines during the drying step of the develop process. DDRP essentially eliminates these failure mechanisms by replacing remaining rinse water with DDRM and providing a structural framework that support resist lines from both sides during spin dry process. Dry development rinse process (DDRP) eliminates the root causes responsible for pattern collapse of photoresist line structures. Since these collapse mechanisms are mitigated, without the need for changes in the photoresist itself, achievable resolution of the state-of-the-art EUV photoresists can further be improved.", "The dynamic absorption coefficients of several CAR and non-CAR EUV photoresists are measured experimentally using a specifically developed setup in transmission mode at the XIL beamline of the Swiss Light Source. The absorption coefficient \u03b1 and the Dill parameters ABC were measured with unprecedented accuracy. In general the \u03b1 of resists match very closely with the theoretical value calculated from elemental densities and absorption coefficients, whereas exceptions are observed. In addition, through the direct measurements of the absorption coefficients and dose-to-clear values, we introduce a new figure of merit called Chemical Sensitivity to account for all the post-absorption chemical reaction ongoing in the resist, which is also predicts a quantitative clearing volume, and respectively clearing radius, due to the photon absorption in the resist. These parameters may help in deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms of EUV concept of clearing volume and clearing radius are then defined and quantitatively calculated.", "We have recently introduced a new molecular resist system that demonstrates high-resolution capability. A series of studies such as quencher choice and loading was conducted in order to optimize the performance of this material. The optimized conditions allowed patterning 14 nm half-pitch (hp) lines with a line width roughness (LWR) of 3.56 nm at the XIL beamline of the Swiss Light source. Furthermore it was possible to resolve 11 nm hp features with 5.9 nm LWR. First exposure results on an NXE3300 are also presented. We have also begun to investigate the addition of metals to EUV photoresist as a means to increase sensitivity and modify secondary electron blur. Initial results for one of the metal additives show that the sensitivity could be enhanced by up to 60 percent.", "EUV lithography is the most promising technology for semiconductor device manufacturing of the 10nm node and beyond. The EUV mask is a key element in the lithographic scanner optical path. The image border is a pattern free dark area around the die on the photomask serving as transition area between the parts of the mask that is shielded from the exposure light by the Reticle Masking (REMA) blades and the die. When printing a die at dense spacing on an EUV scanner, the EUV light reflection from the image border overlaps edges of neighboring dies, affecting CD and contrast in this area. To reduce this effect an etched multilayer type black border was developed, and it was demonstrated that CD impact at the edge of a die is strongly reduced with this type of the black border (BB). However, wafer printing result still showed some CD change influenced by the black border reflection. It was proven that the CD shift was caused by DUV Out of Band (OOB) light which is emitted from EUV light source. New types of a multilayer etched BB were evaluated and showed a good potential for DUV light suppression. In this study, a novel black border called Hybrid Black Border has been developed which allows to eliminate EUV and DUV OOB light reflection. Direct measurements of OOB light from HBB and Normal BB are performed on NXE:3300B ASML EUV scanner; it is shown that HBB OOB reflection is 3x lower than that of Normal BB. Finally, we state that HBB is a promising technology allowing for CD control at die edges.", "At the 5 nm technology node there are competing strategies for patterning: high-NA EUV, double patterning 0.33 NA EUV and a combination of optical self-aligned solutions with EUV. This paper investigates the impact of pattern shift based on the selected patterning strategy. A logic standard cell connection between TS and M0 is simulated to determine the impact of lithographic pattern shift on the overlay budget. At 5 nm node dimensions, high-NA EUV is necessary to expose the most critical layers with a single lithography exposure. The impact of high-NA EUV lithography is illustrated by comparing the pattern shift resulting from 0.33 NA vs. 0.5x NA. For the example 5 nm transistor, cost-beneficial lithography layers are patterned with EUV and the other layers are patterned optically. Both EUV and optical lithography simulations are performed to determine the maximum net pattern shift. Here, lithographic pattern shift is quantified in terms of through-focus error as well as pattern-placement error. The overlay error associated with a hybrid optical/self-aligned and EUV cut patterning scheme is compared with the results of an all EUV solution, providing an assessment of two potential patterning solutions and their impact the overall overlay budget.", "The functional form of coating-induced polarization aberrations in EUV lithography systems is evaluated through polarization ray tracing of an example 3\u00d7EUV scanner with state-of-the-art graded multilayer coatings. In particular, the impact of coating-induced on-axis astigmatism, as well as diattenuation and retardance on image quality are investigated. The point spread function (PSF) consists of four polarization-dependent components: two are nearly diffraction limited and two are highly apodized, and all components can be described by a Mueller matrix Point Spread Matrix (PSM). The highly apodized components are \u201cghost\u201d images that are larger than the diffraction limit, reducing image contrast and resolution.", "We present an approach to image-based pupil plane amplitude and phase characterization using models built with principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a statistical technique to identify the directions of highest variation (principal components) in a high-dimensional dataset. A polynomial model is constructed between the principal components of through-focus intensity for the chosen binary mask targets and pupil amplitude or phase variation. This method separates model building and pupil characterization into two distinct steps, thus enabling rapid pupil characterization following data collection. The pupil plane variation of a zone-plate lens from the Semiconductor High-NA Actinic Reticle Review Project (SHARP) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will be examined using this method. Results will be compared to pupil plane characterization using a previously proposed methodology where inverse solutions are obtained through an iterative process involving least-squares regression.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography with reflective photomasks continues to be a potential patterning technology for high volume manufacturing at the 7 nm technology node and beyond. EUV photomasks with alternative materials to the commonly used Mo/Si multilayer (ML) reflector and patterned Ta-based absorber (both of which are known to require shadow effect corrections and lead to large through-focus pattern placement errors) are being actively explored. Because the reflective bandwidth of a Ru/Si ML is significantly wider than the reflective bandwidth of a Mo/Si ML and the effective reflectance plane in Ru/Si is closer to the ML surface, Ru/Si ML coatings may be viable alternatives to the Mo/Si ML coatings that are commercially available today because they will lead to smaller mask 3D effects. In this paper, increases in the peak reflectivity and the reflective bandwidth of Ru/Si ML reflectors by using B4C interlayers to improve the Ru-Si interfaces are discussed. The conclusions of this paper are supported with the results of both experimental measurements and rigorous simulations.", "The EUV mask infrastructure is of key importance for the successful introduction of EUV lithography into volume production. In particular, for the production of defect free masks an actinic review of potential defect sites is required. ZEISS and the SUNY POLY SEMATECH EUVL Mask Infrastructure consortium started a development program for such an EUV aerial image metrology system, the AIMS EUV. In this paper, we provide measurement data on the system\u2019s key specifications and discuss its performance and capability status.", "Over the past few years numerous advancements in EUV Lithography have proven its feasibility of insertion into High Volume Manufacturing (HVM).1, 2 A lot of progress is made in the area of pellicle development but a commercially solution with related infrastructure is currently unavailable.3, 4 Due to current mask structure and unavailability of a pellicle, a comprehensive strategy to qualify (native defects) and monitor (adder defects) defectivity on mask and wafer is required for implementing EUV Lithography in High Volume Manufacturing. In this work, we assess multiple strategies for mask and wafer defect inspection including a two-fold solution to leverage resolution of e-beam inspection along with throughput of optical inspection are evaluated. Defect capture rates for inspections based on full-die, critical areas based on priority and hotspots based on design and prior inspection data are evaluated. Each strategy has merits and de-merits, particularly related to throughput, effective die coverage and computational overhead. A production ready EUV Exposure tool was utilized to perform exposures at the IBM EUV Center of Excellence in Albany, NY for EUV Lithography Development along with a fully automated line of EUV Mask Infrastructure tools. We will present strategies considered in this study and discuss respective results. The results from the study indicate very low transfer rate of defect detection events from optical mask inspection. They also suggest a hybrid strategy of utilizing both optical and e-beam inspection can provide a comprehensive defect detection which can be employed in High Volume Manufacturing.", "In this paper, we discuss the impact of optimized pupil engineering and photon noise on native defect sensitivity in EUV actinic blank inspection. Native defects include phase-dominated defects, absorber defects, and defects with a combination of phase and absorption behavior. First, we extend the idea of the Zernike phase contrast (ZPC) method and study the impact of optimum phase shift in the pupil plane on native defect sensitivity, showing a 23% signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement compare to bright field (BF) for a phase defect with 20% absorption. We also describe the possibility to increase target defect SNR on target defect sizes at the price of losing the sensitivity on smaller (non-critical) defects. Moreover, we show the advantage of the optimized phase contrast (OZPC) method over BF EUV actinic blank inspection. A single focus scan from OZPC has better inspection efficiency over BF. Second, we make a detailed comparison between the phase contrast with apodization (AZPC) method and dark field (DF) method based on defect sensitivity in the presence of both photon shot noise and camera noise. Performance is compared for a variety of photon levels, mask roughness conditions, and combinations of defect phase and absorption.", "Novel projection electron microscope optics have been developed and integrated into a new inspection system named EBEYE-V30 (\u201cModel EBEYE\u201d is an EBARA\u2019s model code) , and the resulting system shows promise for application to half-pitch (hp) 16-nm node extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) patterned mask inspection. To improve the system\u2019s inspection throughput for 11-nm hp generation defect detection, a new electron-sensitive area image sensor with a high-speed data processing unit, a bright and stable electron source, and an image capture area deflector that operates simultaneously with the mask scanning motion have been developed. A learning system has been used for the mask inspection tool to meet the requirements of hp 11-nm node EUV patterned mask inspection. Defects are identified by the projection electron microscope system using the \u201cdefectivity\u201d from the characteristics of the acquired image. The learning system has been developed to reduce the labor and costs associated with adjustment of the detection capability to cope with newly-defined mask defects. We describe the integration of the developed elements into the inspection tool and the verification of the designed specification. We have also verified the effectiveness of the learning system, which shows enhanced detection capability for the hp 11-nm node.", "For the successful implementation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography in the upcoming technology nodes, a major challenge to overcome is the stable and reliable detection and characterization of mask defects. We have recently presented a reflective mode EUV mask scanning lensless imaging tool (RESCAN) which is installed at the XIL-II beamline of the Swiss Light Source and showed reconstructed aerial images of test patterns on EUV masks. RESCAN uses scanning coherent diffractive imaging (SCDI) methods to obtain actinic aerial images of EUV photomasks and was designed for 20 nm on-wafer resolution. Our SCDI algorithm reconstructs the measured sample by iteratively solving the phase-problem using over-determined diffraction data gathered by scanning across the specimen with a finite illumination. It provides phase and amplitude aerial images of EUV photomasks with high resolution without the need to use high NA (numerical aperture) lenses. Contrary to scanning microscopy and full-field microscopy, where the resolution is limited by the spot size or NA of the lens, the achievable resolution with our method depends on the detector noise and NA of the detector. To increase the resolution of our tool, we upgraded RESCAN with a new detector and algorithms. Here we present the results obtained with the new tool that is capable of up to 10 nm on-wafer resolution. We believe that the realization of our prototype marks a significant step towards overcoming the limitations imposed by methods relying on imaging optics and shows a viable solution for actinic mask metrology.", "Improvements in the detection capability of a high-volume-manufacturing (HVM) actinic blank inspection (ABI) prototype for native defects caused by illumination numerical aperture (NA) enlargement were evaluated. A mask blank was inspected by varying the illumination NA. The defect signal intensity increased with illumination NA enlargement as predicted from simulation. The mask blank was also inspected with optical tools, and no additional phase defect was detected. All of the printable phase defects were verified to have been detected by the HVM ABI prototype.", "The use of EUV photomasks in a semiconductor manufacturing environment requires their periodic inspection to ensure they are continually free of defects that could impact device yield. Defects typically occur from fall-on particles or from surface degradation such as \u201chaze\u201d. The proposed use of a polycrystalline-based EUV pellicle to prevent fall-on particles would preclude periodic through-pellicle mask defect inspection using e-beam, as well as, DUV inspection tools (the pellicle is opaque at DUV wavelengths). Thus, to use these types of defect inspection tools would require removal of the EUV pellicle before inspection. After inspection, the pellicle would need to be re-attached and the mask re-qualified using a test wafer, thus causing expense and delays. While EUV-wavelength inspection tools could inspect through such a pellicle precluding the need to remove the pellicle, these tools are not likely to be available in the commercial marketplace for many years. An alternate EUV pellicle material has been developed that is semi-transparent to 193nm wavelengths, thus allowing through-pellicle inspection using existing ArF-based, or other 193nm wavelength mask inspection tools. This eliminates the requirement to remove the pellicle for defect inspection and the associated time and expense. In this work, we will conduct an initial evaluation of through-pellicle EUV mask defect inspection using an existing 193nm mask inspection tool. This initial evaluation will include durability of the pellicle to defect inspection, and impact of the pellicle on inspection tool performance.", "EUV lithography for resolution below 8 nm half pitch requires the numerical aperture (NA) of the projection lens to be significantly larger than the current state-of-the-art 0.33NA. In order to be economically viable, a throughput in the range of 100 wafers per hour is needed. As a result of the increased NA, the incidence angles of the light rays at the mask increase significantly. Consequently the shadowing and the variation of the multi-layer reflectivity deteriorate the aerial image contrast to unacceptably low values at the current 4x magnification. The only solution to reduce the angular range at the mask is to increase the magnification. Simulations show that we have to double the magnification to 8x in order to overcome the shadowing effects. Assuming that the mask infrastructure will not change the mask form factor, this would inevitably lead to a field size that is a quarter of the field size of current 0.33NA step and scan systems. This would reduce the throughput of the high-NA scanner to a value significantly below 100 wafers per hour unless additional measures are taken. This paper presents an anamorphic step and scan system capable to print fields that are half the field size of the current full field. The anamorphic system has the potential to achieve a throughput in excess of 150 wafers per hour by increasing the transmission of the optics as well as increasing the acceleration of the wafer stage and mask stage. This makes it an economically viable lithography solution. The proposed 4x/8x magnification is not the only logical solution. There are potentially other magnifications to increase the scanner performance while at the same time reducing the m ask requirements.", "The SHARP High numerical aperture Actinic Reticle review Project is a synchrotron-based, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) microscope dedicated to photomask research. SHARP emulates the illumination and imaging conditions of current EUV lithography scanners and several generations into the future. An anamorphic imaging optic with increased mask side-NA in the horizontal and increased demagnification in the vertical direction has been proposed to overcome limitations of current multilayer coatings and extend EUV lithography beyond 0.33 NA.1 Zoneplate lenses with an anamorphic 4x/8x NA of 0.55 are fabricated and installed in the SHARP microscope to emulate anamorphic imaging. SHARP\u2019s Fourier synthesis illuminator with a range of angles exceeding the collected solid angle of the newly designed elliptical zoneplates can produce arbitrary angular source spectra, matched to anamorphic imaging. A target with anamorphic dense features down to 50-nm critical dimension is fabricated using 40-nm of nickel as the absorber. In a demonstration experiment anamorphic imaging at 0.55 4x/8xNA and 6\u00b0 central ray angle is compared to conventional imaging at 0.5 4xNA and 8\u00b0 central ray angle. A significant contrast loss in horizontal features is observed in the conventional images. The anamorphic images show the same image quality in the horizontal and vertical directions.", "The lenses with coaxial mirrors allow obtain NA values up to of 0.8 and demagnification \u03b2 \u226510. The larger \u03b2 value leads to the mask cost reducing, as in this case, the elements of the IC pattern template can be made bigger and, therefore, with fewer defects. \u0421oaxial schemes can engender a problem of the image plane shift beyond the projection lens element boundaries near the wafer. The projection lens consisting of four coaxial mirrors with NA= 0.485 and s = 12 combined with the \u201dVanguard\u201d imaging subsystem have been designed. According to the computation the circuit features at 10 nm in center and 20 nm on the edge of 12.4 mm field of view can be imaged.", "Plasmas emitting near \u03bb=6.7nm are of interest for beyond EUV lithography (BEUVL). We have conducted a comprehensive study of the spectral characteristics, conversion efficiency, and source size of Gd and Tb laser-produced plasmas over a broad range of laser pulsewidths (120ps-4ns) and irradiation intensities (1.4\u00d71011-6.1\u00d71013W/cm2). The data over the entire parameter range was acquired using a single diode-pumped Yb: YAG laser. The angular distribution of the BEUV emission was measured using an array of calibrated energy-monitors, allowing for an accurate estimate of the BEUV yield. A similar conversion efficiency of 0.47% into a 0.6% bandwidth in 2\u03c0 solid angle was measured for both Gd and Tb plasma.", "In EIDEC, a micro extreme UV (EUV) exposure tool for next-generation lithography has been developed, referred to as a High NA Small Field Exposure Tool (HSFET), and its basic configuration is as follows: Xe DPP source, critical illumination configuration, a rotationally moving turret with several sigma apertures, a larger than 30 \u00d7 200 \u03bcm field size, and variable NA mechanics to cover from 0.3 to 0.5 NA and beyond. The PO optical performance is well suited to our required 11 nm half-pitch patterning. The transmitted optical wavefront error (WFE) was measured and confirmed to be 0.29 nm RMS, which is far less than the required value of 0.6 nm RMS, and the tool was successfully installed in August 2015. Here we show the exposure results using a newly designed reticle for HSFET patterning. We report the basic printing performance and consideration for high-NA effects as know n polarization effects.", "The feature scaling and patterning control required for the 7nm node has introduced EUV as a candidate lithography technology for enablement. To be established as a front-up lithography solution for those requirements, all the associated aspects with yielding a technology are also in the process of being demonstrated, such as defectivity process window through patterning transfer and electrical yield. This paper will review the current status of those metrics for 7nm at IBM, but also focus on the challenges therein as the industry begins to look beyond 7nm. To address these challenges, some of the fundamental process aspects of holistic EUV patterning are explored and characterized. This includes detailing the contrast entitlement enabled by EUV, and subsequently characterizing state-of-the-art resist printing limits to realize that entitlement. Because of the small features being considered, the limits of film thinness need to be characterized, both for the resist and underlying SiARC or inorganic hardmask, and the subsequent defectivity, both of the native films and after pattern transfer. Also, as we prepare for the next node, multipatterning techniques will be validated in light of the above, in a way that employs the enabling aspects of EUV as well. This will thus demonstrate EUV not just as a technology that can print small features, but one where all aspects of the patterning are understood and enabling of a manufacturing-worthy technology.", "0.33 NA EUV lithography is expected to be introduced into High Volume Manufacturing at k1 values of approximately 0.4...0.5. This is significantly larger than state of the art immersion lithography which can operate at k1 of 0.3. We investigated the impact of contrast enhancement on the imaging properties of Contact Holes and Lines and Spaces. Contrast was adjusted by changing the illumination properties pupil fill ratio and center incidence angle. We found a strong improvement of the local Critical Dimension control: line width variation for Lines and Spaces and hole to hole CD variations for arrays of contact holes. For all features we found a similar dependency on contrast. As the local Critical Dimension variations contribute significant to Edge Placement Error budgets, we foresee the implementation of contrast enhancements already at moderate k1 values around 0.4.", "Sub 0.3k1 regime has been widely adopted for high volume manufacturing (HVM) of optical lithography due to various resolution enhancement technologies (RETs). It is not certain when such low k1 is feasible in EUV, though most technologies are available in EUV also. In this paper, experimental results on patterning performance of line space (L/S) and contact hole (C/H) in EUV lithography will be presented. First, practical k1 value with 0.33NA EUV lithography was investigated through experiment using NXE3300 EUV tool. Patterning limit, as defined by local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) for C/H array pattern were measured with respect to various design rules. It was evaluated that the effect of off axis illumination (OAI) mode with various illumination conditions to improve the patterning performance and to reduce k1 limit. Then the experimental results of LCDU were compared with normalized image log slope (NILS) values from simulation. EUV source mask optimization (SMO) technologies to increase NILS with FlexPupil option of EUV scanner were evaluated and possibility of further improvement was also discussed.", "EUV lithography is uniquely positioned to extend single exposure solutions for critical imaging layers at the 7 nm technology node and beyond. In this work, we demonstrate the application of advanced EUV resolution enhancement techniques to enable bidirectional printing of 36 and 32 nm pitch standard logic cell and SRAM designs with 0.33 NA optics using an EUV OPC model. Prior work has highlighted the issues of pattern placement errors and image contrast loss due to the non-telecentricity that is inherent in EUV reflective imaging systems and masks. This work has also demonstrated utilizing asymmetric pupil to reduce the pattern placement error. It has been previously shown that there is a potential reduction in common process window due to through-pitch best focus shifts with non-optimized SRAF placement. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of: pattern placement error aware SMO, asymmetric illumination shape, and SRAF placement optimization to increase the overall common process window by as much as 40% compared to OPC only optimization. Consequently, we demonstrate the improved post-RET single patterning solution for 0.33 NA EUV bi-directional 7 nm node logic designs. We show that these techniques can achieve the required performance for MEEF, best focus shift across features, and ILS, which is known to be important for reducing stochastics and subsequent line-edge-roughness (LER).", "Assist features are commonly used in DUV lithography to improve the lithographic process window of isolated features under illumination conditions that enable the printability of dense features. With the introduction of EUV lithography, the interaction between 13.5 nm light and the mask features generates strong mask 3D effects. On wafer, the mask 3D effects manifest as pitch-dependent best focus positions, pattern asymmetries and image contrast loss. To minimize the mask 3D effects, and enhance the lithographic process window, we explore by means of wafer print evaluation the use of assist features with different sizes and placements. The assist features are placed next to isolated features and two bar structures, consistent with theN5 (imec iN7) node dimensions for 0.33NA and we use different types of off-axis illumination . For the generic iN7 structures, wafer imaging will be compared to simulation results and an assessment of optimal assist feature configuration will be made. It is also essential to understand the potential benefit of using assist features and to weigh that benefit against the price of complexity associated with adding sub-resolution features on a production mask. To that end, we include an OPC study that compares a layout treated with assist features, to one without assist features, using full-chip complexity metrics like data size.", "As feature sizes become smaller and smaller, the complexity and the cost of using multiple patterning with 193i becomes a significant issue in lithography. Hence, EUV starts to play an important role for 7nm node and beyond. Industry is now investigating solutions on all major EUV components \u2013 source, resist mask technology, as well as resolution enhancement techniques (RET), including sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs). Unlike ArF lithography, the non-telecentricity of the EUV optical system coupled with the relatively thick mask stack causes shadowing effects. This asymmetric imaging may in turn have an impact on assist feature placement, requiring different SRAF rules for different directions at the edges and corners. In this work, simulation studies were conducted using Calibre on 20x20 nm contact patterns through pitch to investigate the impact of assist features. Assist features were varied as a function of horizontal / vertical positions independently and the image quality parameters such as depth of focus (DOF), MEEF, best focus (BF) shift and overlapping process window were monitored with and without SRAFs. Both rules-based and model based assist feature placements were implemented for selected patterns. Results indicate that inclusion of assist features for contact arrays improve individual and overlapping process windows with minimal effect on best focus shift. Wafer data collected from these patterns confirmed the improvement in overlapping process window with the inclusion of assist features.", "EUV interference lithography records the interference pattern of two diffracted, coherent light beams, where the pattern resolution is half the diffraction grating resolution. The fabrication of diffraction grating masks by e-beam lithography is restricted by the electron proximity effect and pattern transfer limitations into diffraction efficient materials. By patterning HSQ lines at a relaxed pitch to avoid the electron proximity effect, depositing conformal iridium via atomic layer deposition, followed by ion milling the top and bottom iridium and HSQ removal, we fabricated iridium diffraction gratings at double the line spacing of the original HSQ lines. 6 nm half-pitch patterns were achieved using these masks marking a new record resolution in photolithography.", "In this paper, approaches are explored for combining EUV with DSA for via layer patterning at the N7 and N5 logic nodes. Simulations indicate opportunity for significant LCDU improvement at the N7 node without impacting the required exposure dose. A templated DSA process based on NXE:3300 exposed EUV pre-patterns has been developed and supports the simulations. The main point of improvement concerns pattern placement accuracy with this process. It is described how metrology contributes to the measured placement error numbers. Further optimization of metrology methods for determining local placement errors is required. Next, also via layer patterning at the N5 logic node is considered. On top of LCDU improvement, the combination of EUV with DSA also allows for maintaining a single mask solution at this technology node, due to the ability of the DSA process to repair merging vias. It is experimentally shown, how shaping of templates for such via multiplication helps in placement accuracy control. Peanut-shaped pre-patterns, which can be printed using EUV lithography, give significantly better placement accuracy control compared to elliptical pre-patterns.", "Spin coating has been used as a photoresist application method for many years,[1,2] and it has continued to include applications such as the tri-layer with stacked photoresist, Si containing anti-reflected coating (Si-ARC), and Spin on Carbon (SOC). Last year we reported EUV defectivity improvement, but the causes of some defect types were not found.[3,4] In this study, the defects unique to the coated organic film were detected using an LS9300 by Hitachi High-Technologies, and some of these defects were able to be mitigated by optimizing the SOKUDO-DUO track system. Utilizing these systems in tandem, we have revealed a mechanism of EUV pattern defect reduction linked to novel detected film coating defects. During the conference, we will discuss expansion of this concept to other film coatings.", "Towards the end of 2014, ASML committed to provide a EUV pellicle solution to the industry. Last year, during SPIE Microlithography 2015, we introduced the NXE pellicle concept, a removable pellicle solution that is compatible with current and future patterned mask inspection methods. This paper shows results of how we took this concept to a complete EUV pellicle solution for the industry. We will highlight some technical design challenges we faced developing the NXE pellicle and how we solved them. We will also present imaging results of pellicle exposures on a 0.33 NA NXE scanner system. In conjunction with the NXE pellicle, we will also present the supporting tooling we have developed to enable pellicle use.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has received much attention in the semiconductor industry as a promising candidate to extend dimensional scaling beyond 10nm. Recently EUV pellicle introduction is required to improve particle level inside scanner for EUV mass production. We demonstrate that a new pellicle material, nanometer-thick graphite film (NGF), is one of the best candidates of EUV pellicle membrane. A NGF pellicle with excellent thermal (\u03b5\u22650.4 @R.T, <100nm), mechanical (415MPa @~100nm), chemical and optical (24hrs durability under exposure of EUV/H2 at 4W/cm2 with pH2~5Pa) properties can be a promising and superb candidate for EUV pellicle membrane compared to Si pellicles with capping layers.", "EUV mask protection against defects during use remains a challenge for EUV lithography. A stand-off protective membrane \u2013 a pellicle \u2013 is targeted to prevent yield losses in high volume manufacturing during handling and exposure, just as it is for 193nm lithography. The pellicle is thin enough to transmit EUV exposure light, yet strong enough to remain intact and hold any particles out of focus during exposure. The development of pellicles for EUV is much more challenging than for 193nm lithography for multiple reasons including: high absorption of most materials at EUV wavelength, pump-down sequences in the EUV vacuum system, and exposure to high intensity EUV light. To solve the problems of transmission and film durability, various options have been explored. In most cases a thin core film is considered, since the deposition process for this is well established and because it is the simplest option. The transmission specification typically dictates that membranes are very thin (~50nm or less), which makes both fabrication and film mechanical integrity difficult. As an alternative, low density films (e.g. including porosity) will allow thicker membranes for a given transmission specification, which is likely to improve film durability. The risk is that the porosity could influence the imaging. At imec, two cases of pellicle concepts based on reducing density have been assessed : (1) 3D-patterned SiN by directed self-assembly (DSA), and (2) carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon nanosheets (CNS). The first case is based on SiN membranes that are 3D-patterned by Directed Self Assembly (DSA). The materials are tested relative to the primary specifications: EUV transmission and film durability. A risk assessment of printing performance is provided based on simulations of scattered energy. General conclusions on the efficacy of various approaches will provided.", "The utilization of EUV pellicles as protective layers for EUV masks requires the use of refractory materials that can tolerate large temperature excursions due to the non-negligible absorption of EUV radiation during exposure. Additionally, the mechanical stress induced on the EUV pellicle by the thermal load is dependent on the thermal expansion of the material which can be responsible for transient wrinkling. In this study, an ultrathin (20 nm), free-standing membrane based on silicon nitride is utilized as a learning vehicle to understand the material requirements of EUV pellicles under dynamic exposure conditions that are typical of commercial EUV scanners. First, the nanoscale radiative properties (emissivity) and thermo-mechanical failure temperature of the dielectric film under vacuum conditions are experimentally investigated utilizing a pulsed ArF (193 nm) probing laser. The silicon nitride membrane is found to be marginally compatible with an equivalent 80W EUV source power under steady state illumination conditions. Next, the thermal behavior of the EUV pellicle under dynamic exposure conditions is simulated using a finite element solver. The transient temperature profile and stress distribution across the membrane under stationary state conditions are extracted for an equivalent 60W EUV power source and the pellicle wrinkling due to heating and consequent impact on CD uniformity is estimated. The present work provides a generalized methodology to anticipate the thermal response of a EUV pellicle under realistic exposure conditions.", "Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) is the most promising technology as substitute for multiple patterning based on ArF immersion lithography. If enough productivity can be accomplished, EUV will take main role in the chip manufacturing. Since the introduction of NXE3300, many significant results have been achieved in source power and availability, but lots of improvements are still required in various aspects for the implementation of EUV lithography on high volume manufacturing. Among them, it is especially important to attain high sensitivity resist without degrading other resolution performance. In this paper, performances of various resists were evaluated with real device patterns on NXE3300 scanner and technical progress of up-to-date EUV resists will be shown by comparing with the performance of their predecessors. Finally the prospect of overcoming the triangular trade-off between sensitivity, resolution, line edge roughness (LER) and achieving high volume manufacturing will be discussed."], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
