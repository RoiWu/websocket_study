As a result, information and communication technologies (ICT) are seeing \"super-exponential growth.\" But, starting in late 2020, SRC highlighted that the demands for ICT are encroaching on global energy production levels. Even with all of the improvements that 2D-scaling and Moore's law have afforded semiconductors, an insatiable global appetite for ICT is yielding energy consumption levels that are the new headwind for its continued advancement. We must invest in and deliver new paradigms at scale with a radically improved (106:1) energy efficiency. This unprecedented production also meets a time where global sustainability has never been more important. As an R&D community, we have an obligation to ensure that the growth in chip manufacturing and packaged chip volumes is as environmentally benign as possible and does not stress our already taxed planet. And, most importantly, our industry faces a workforce shortage where the next generation of innovators demands that their efforts positively contribute to a better future, for both society and the environment. In response to these critical factors, SRC, in partnership with NIST, worked with 298 individuals representing 112 industrial, academic, and government organizations to create and publish the Microelectronics and Advanced Packaging Technologies (MAPT) Roadmap. It is a plan to revitalize the semiconductor industry for decades to meet the market, workforce, and sustainability needs of our collective future.", "The worldwide demand for computing is undergoing a notable shift, driven by factors like AI/ML, the need for ubiquitous connectivity, and a focus on energy efficiency. In pursuit of the industry's commitment to continuous innovation at Moore\u2019s Law cadence, a system technology co-optimization (STCO) approach has been embraced. Consequently, the distinctions between silicon technology and advanced packaging are blurring. This keynote delves into the evolution of advanced lithography and patterning in the STCO era of Moore\u2019s Law, highlighting the ongoing progress in both silicon and advanced packaging. The importance of sharing ecosystem expertise and ideas across silicon and advanced packaging is underscored for reaping significant benefits. Additionally, with the industry aiming to surpass the $1 trillion revenue mark by the end of the decade, the imperative to innovate on the ongoing journey to environmentally sustainable technologies is emphasized.", "High density memory device has become an inevitable demand of processing capabilities and storage in various applications. The high-density memory devices been mainly developed by lithography, the lateral-scaling technology. In 2010s, DUV multi-patterning technique was introduced as a main contributor of the lateral-scaling, which however recently comes at the cost due to expanding of quadruple patterning and reduction of process margin. As a result, EUV lithography has joined into dominant patterning options for maximizing patterning resolution and reducing cost. This paper presents our latest patterning solutions extending patterning limit beyond sub 10nm, and outlook of future technologies on memory device patterning such as EUV, High-NA, 3D structure, and bonding overlay.", "This conference presentation was prepared for Optical and EUV Nanolithography XXXVII, 2024.", "This conference presentation was prepared for Optical and EUV Nanolithography XXXVII, 2024.", "This conference presentation was prepared for Optical and EUV Nanolithography XXXVII, 2024.", "This conference presentation was prepared for Optical and EUV Nanolithography XXXVII, 2024.", "This conference presentation was prepared for Optical and EUV Nanolithography XXXVII, 2024.", "We are in a race to create Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that can exceed the capabilities of the human brain. This quest is the moonshot of next-generation engineers and scientists alike, and the path to this realization starts with semiconductor technology. Supported by advancements in semiconductor technology, we are making significant progress in the areas of Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and are now within grasp of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). As we watch this journey unfold in front of our eyes, memory is becoming central to our progress. This is substantiated by the fact that bit shipments have increased by 12X for DRAM, and 48X for NAND, just in the last decade! The progress we have driven to date is something we can all be proud of but is still not enough to answer bigger questions and resolve greater challenges that can only be addressed by enabling more advanced technology in our field. And as we enable more advanced technology, we must continue to ask ourselves a few key questions, to ensure we are growing these capabilities in a sustainable and ethical manner.", "Accurate data for optical properties are essential for the design of new materials needed for EUV mask absorber layers, photoresists and pellicles. Fortunately, in the EUV we are able to use the independent atom approximation to estimate the index of refraction for complex materials from the atomic scattering factors. CXRO maintains a database of the atomic scattering factors. Improving the accuracy of this database relies on the accurate measurements of the elements. Measurements with improved accuracy over a broad range of wavelengths are being performed at synchrotron facilities around the world. Recent advances will be discussed.", "Transistor architectures below the 7 nm node are significantly enabled by EUV lithography, with single exposure EUV processes simplifying small pitch patterning processes. However, EUV stochastics are a significant hurdle in meeting aggressive process assumption targets and achieving high yields. In particular, line edge roughness and line width roughness (LER and LWR) at EUV patterned gate have been identified as key limiters of device performance and yield within these nodes. Here, we study the impact of different illumination schemes on gate LER and LWR. We specifically utilize NILS to target LER and LWR reduction, with high NILS observed to primarily reduce high frequency roughness. Post etch, a largely illumination independent reduction in the mid and high frequency regimes is observed. Finally, impact of illumination on long channel gate patterning is assessed and a NILS independent LWR response is observed both post development and etch.", "The stochastic effect in contact single patterning is one of the primary challenges in extending into sub-40nm pitch with 0.33NA EUV. EUV stochastic defects induced by EUV photon shot noise are known to strongly correlate to image contrast. Mitigation of Mask3D induced contrast fading is one of the key solutions to enable further shrink, while maintaining sufficient defect-free process latitude. Wavefront and pupil co-optimization is designed to compensate the Mask 3D phase error that leads to contrast fading. For application in HVM, the newly developed Pupil/Mask/Wavefront co-optimization gives the best imaging performance while maintaining the illumination efficiency and decreasing the rms wavefront for the final optimal wavefront to ensure there is no negative impact on the rest of the patterns that are not included in the optimization. In this paper, we investigate how to apply Pupil/Mask/Wavefront co-optimization to improve the image contrast of a sub-40nm pitch contact hole array, including in-resist verification. We will first explain the fundamentals of Mask 3D fading mitigation via phase injection for a 1D feature and how to extend this concept to 2D features. We will compare the effectiveness of new Pupil/Mask/Wavefront co-optimization versus Zernike Z5 or Z6 only phase injection method. Finally, we will show the potential benefit in combination with using a low-n phase shifting mask for which the optimum image contrast is achieved with the co-optimized wavefront, pupil and mask.", "The small depth of focus of high-NA EUV systems asks for robust focus metrology and possibly even focus control. Fast optical focus metrology is possible with dedicated focus-sensitive targets that make use of mask-3D effects. It is beneficial to connect this optical focus measurement to the focus behavior of actual device structures. Focus errors of device structures can be determined by measuring Pattern Placement Errors (PPE) with e-beam since a focus error usually lead to a layout-dependent PPE. By using a large field of view SEM we can capture a large variety of pattern layouts in 1 image acquisition. This large pattern variety creates a lot of diversity resulting in a robust \u201con-device\u201d focus measurement.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) system at 0.33 numerical aperture (NA) has been used for high volume manufacturing of advanced technology node devices. As pattern pitch shrinks, low-k1 imaging becomes necessary but it typically suffers from reduced imaging contrast. In the case of low-k1 imaging, critical dimension (CD) variation on EUV mask enhances on wafer, which is called Mask Error Enhancement Factor (MEEF). CD variation for tighter line and space (L/S) features on the photomask has taken up a large fraction of wafer CD variation. Therefore, it is important to balance improvement of Normalized Image Log Slope (NILS) and MEEF. Understanding the mask contribution to EUVL is one of the important initiatives to further optimize 0.33-NA EUVL employability towards pushing down pitch scaling. The optical properties of the EUV mask absorber, which are the refraction index n and extinction coefficient k, have potential to improve NILS and MEEF. Low-n attenuated phase-shift mask (attPSM) is expected to mitigate mask three dimensional (M3D) effects and to enhance the image contrast compared to traditional Ta-based absorber mask. In this study we experimentally evaluated the MEEF on the drawn feature size, illumination, and mask absorber properties to characterize the impact of these optical factors on MEEF for the appropriate condition using the NXE:3400B EUV scanner. This paper covers two types of mask absorber materials which are Ta-based and low-n attPSM. We experimentally demonstrated that low-n absorber EUVL mask is expected to improve the balance of MEEF at vertical L/S through pitch due to suppression of best focus variation. We also tried to identify the suitable absorber optical properties in terms of MEEF and NILS on both 0.33-NA and 0.55-NA EUVL through rigorous lithographic simulations.", "Improving local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) as well as productivity in the extreme pitch of EUV layers is the most important challenge in DRAM device. In general, automated source optimization (SO) process is limited to investigate all possible candidates for the best LCDU performance, like fixing the amount of mirror in specific sigma and generating uncommon pole shapes. In this paper, we present LCDU improvement method in hexagonal contact array patterns based on controlling the center sigma position in the EUV pupil. We demonstrated that the LCDU was improved when the source points were located on the outer edge side of pupils regardless of normalized image log slope (NILS). This indicated the mirror location in the source is significant for LCDU in the similar NILS conditions. Moreover, it was confirmed that the CD along the critical direction increased as source points moved toward the center of the 3-beam imaging area, thus the changed CD ellipticity could further improve LCDU or cut down ACI defect source. The results showed a similar tendency in both the binary mask (BIN) and phase shift mask (PSM) even to differ type of resist. Overall, we verified the correlation of LCDU and ADI CD ellipticity through the sigma center position control, and we believe this approach will contribute to future research on improving LCDU.", "The line edge roughness (LER) of the mask absorber increases as the critical dimension (CD) approaches the mask\u2019s imaging limit. Mask LER has an impact on the corresponding wafer LER, especially in the case of EUV lithography because of the inverse dependence on exposure wavelength. Low-frequency mask LER is transferred directly to the wafer LER while high-frequency mask LER impacts the wafer image by reducing the image log slope (ILS). In this study, we designed a programmed random LER module and fabricated it on a state-of-the-art EUV mask to introduce controlled variations in LER amplitude while maintaining a similar spatial frequency to the reference mask LER. The unbiased 3-\u03c3 mask LER was extracted from the 36nm pitch line/space design, showing that programmed LER is transferred to mask LER. The mask was exposed with the ASML NXE:3400B EUV lithography scanner under focus exposure matrix (FEM) conditions. The transfer of mask LER to wafer LER exhibited a similar trend in programmed jog amplitude and step. Wafer LER increases when the exposure conditions deviate from the best dose or best focus, as the mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) increases and is proportional to the LER transfer function. It was observed that programmed LER is filtered through the illumination system, by comparing the power spectral density (PSD) of mask and wafer LER. The programmed LER led to increased wafer defects, specifically, wafer 3-\u03c3 unbiased LER above 2.4nm starts to increase wafer defects.", "Background: Patterning of very tight pitches suffers from stochastic variations that can impact yield. Different patterning processes with lower stochastic variations are preferred when those lower variations have a quantifiable benefit in terms of device yield or performance. Aim: Here two different process flows, a traditional EUV patterning flow and one involving directed self-assembly (DSA) rectification, will be compared to determine the differences expected in device failure rates, with the failure mechanism being the shorting of a via hole to the wrong feature. Approach: These device failure rates will be based on a rigorous edge placement error (EPE) model taking stochastic variations into account, leading to predictions of device failure and the definition of an overlay process window (OPW): the range of overlay errors that keeps the device failure rate above a minimum specified value. Results: For the patterning of 18 nm pitch line/space patterns contacted with 12 nm wide vias, the EUV process flow produces a 2.5 nm OPW, while the DSA rectification process expands that OPW significantly to 4.0 nm. Conclusions: Using a rigorous EPE modeling approach fed by accurate stochastics measurements, the significant benefits of the DSA rectification process have been quantified.", "As technology nodes further shrink, high yield becomes more and more challenging to achieve. Photoresist resolution (see Figure 2) and CD uniformity are two core yield limiters. This can be improved with the use of Lam\u2019s EUV dry photoresist system[1], where the dry develop technique is used to replace wet develop. This process is also less prone to pattern collapse[1]. Another advantage of this new photoresist system consists in its higher dose sensitivity compared to conventional photoresists which leads to higher throughput[1][2]. High resolution process needs to be combined with optical proximity correction (OPC) to enable cutting edge EUV patterning. OPC relies on the capability of a model to predict accurately the behavior of such an innovative process. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive quantification and characterization of the accuracy of an OPC model fitted for this process ADI and AEI (after carbon open). We generated wafers exposed with an OPC calibration reticle, processed with Lam\u2019s dry deposited and dry developed photoresist. The anchor is a horizontal line-space grating at pitch 32nm (Figure 2). We acquired CDSEM images of more than 1800 features ADI (after dry develop) and AEI (after carbon open). A subset of the features were collected through FEM ADI. To better understand the characteristics of the dry photoresist system, we used metrics such as proximity, MEEF, DoF and EL. ADI OPC models were calibrated using ASML Tachyon software. Finally, we evaluated the OPC model accuracy of both Tachyon FEM+ (physically motivated) and Newron (machine-learning) engines, ADI for pitch 32nm BEOL metal layer use case.", "It is crucial to predict hard failure in photolithography process to determine design rules and process condition in the product development stage. Accurate prediction of hard failures through simulation have powerful effects such as shortening the product development period and improving mass production yield. Previously, parameters used to determine whether a pattern is expected to fail include NILS (Normalized Image Log-Slope), image contrast, or chemical distribution in the photoresist. However, these methods are almost infeasible because the accuracy becomes low as process condition changes and calibration process of chemical distribution is too complicated. In this paper, a novel method using optical parameters and machine learning is proposed to predict hard failures of ADI (After Development Inspection) patterns, and this methodology was evaluated in the process of applying inorganic photoresist.", "With state-of-the-art EUV lithography moving to the 3 and 2 nm nodes, yield control and connected to that particle contamination control are crucial aspect of High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM). While much progress has been made in recent years, the continuously tightening node requirements translate into ever more stringent requirements on particle contamination control. Besides for lithographic scanners, operating in a low background pressure hydrogen gas environment, particle contamination control is also important for space exploration (which also operates in low pressure environments), where particles may lead to malfunctioning moving parts, loss of solar power generation, and human health hazards. A key factor in release of particles in these low-pressure environments is the ionization of the low-pressure background gas by energetic photons (for instance EUV in lithographic scanners, and broadband energetic radiation in space), and resulting plasma with fast electrons of 25 eV and above. Experiments show that these electrons can mobilize and remove particles on most materials, and that the governing effects strongly depend on the substrate material, coating and surface finishing. This paper will discuss work on understanding and modeling these effects and describe possible solution paths to improve particle contamination control, both for lithographic scanners and for space exploration.", "EUV lithography is rapidly being pushed to its resolution limit, where tradeoffs are heightened between resolution, throughput, and stochastics. Mitigation strategies include attenuated phase shift masks (aPSMs) and thinner high-k absorbers. Furthermore, multilayer bandwidth and phase shift may need to be reassessed. All these improvements relate to mask 3D effects (M3D), arising from several causes: First, phase shift vs pitch, which sets the aPSM target phase shift around 1.2pi instead of pi. Second, absorber thickness effects which directly relate to the promise of high-k absorbers. And third, multilayer effects like bandwidth and phase vs angle. We propose to quantify these effects in simulation for different EUV scanner generations (0.33 NA, high-NA, or hyper-NA). Finally, we will propose measuring these effects with the EUV Tech ENK (EUV n/k tool) using actinic scatterometry. The complexity of M3D suggests that new metrics of multilayer and absorber performance beyond reflectivity will need to be considered. Actinic scatterometry provides a promising route to measuring M3D due to its sensitivity to wavelength, angle, and feature size.", "Lasertec released an actinic patterned mask inspection (APMI) system named ACTIS in 2019 and has since been providing it as an EUV mask inspection solution for use at mask shops and semiconductor fabs in high-volume manufacturing. Actinic inspection is a type of inspection that utilizes 13.5nm EUV, the wavelength of light used in EUV lithography. ACTIS performs high-resolution, high-throughput inspection of EUV masks and detects mask defects that print on wafers in the lithography process (printable defects). One of the key advantages offered by APMI is its ability to perform highresolution through-pellicle inspection. EUV pellicles are expected to be used in semiconductor fabs, and ACTIS can detect printable defects on EUV masks even when a pellicle is attached to them. High-NA EUV lithography will be used at the technology nodes of N2 and beyond. The projection optics of high-NA EUV lithography are anamorphic optics, which have different scales of magnification for the horizontal and vertical axes. Lasertec has developed a next-generation model of ACTIS for high-NA mask inspection. It uses higher NA objective optics to meet the requirements of high-NA EUV mask inspection. This paper discusses the next-generation ACTIS for high-NA EUV lithography and its inspection performance on programmed defect masks that are similar to actual production masks. The paper also discusses the characteristics of a light source and illumination optics required for APMI.", "EUV blank is a complicated system including substrate, multilayer, cap layer, absorber, and so on. All those structures contribute to the lithographic performances. In this paper, lithographic impacts of cap layer were simulated. By evaluating lithographic performances for both a binary type mask and a phase shift type mask, impact of cap layer thickness was clarified especially for best focus range of PSM. Second, impacts of cap layer recess induced by mask and lithographic processes were evaluated. Bayesian optimization method was applied to optimize lithographic performances efficiently. The results show thinner cap thickness enables to improve dose aware resolution (NILS \u00d7 Threshold0.5) and its stability. On the other hand, thinner cap thickness may cause worse durability for the processes such as etching and repairing. So balance between lithographic performances and film durability should be considered.", "EUV stochastic pattern anomalies are a major obstacle in future EUV lithography, and they depend on processes such as development, underlayers, extrinsic anomalies, and resist materials. This paper explores the impact of molecular clustering on EUV stochasticity using the discrete dev/etch model since the above factors can impact stochasticity through mechanical interactions among nearby molecules. Pattern formations with larger/denser molecular sub-clusters (SCs) suppress stochastic pattern anomalies because forming such sub-clusters requires more photons. Stochastic pattern anomalies increase with thinning resist films, however, since the dispersion in the sub-cluster ratio within a small volume of exposed resist film increases as the volume size approaches the cluster size. LWRs and defect probabilities in thin resist films decrease with increasing the sub-cluster density requirements. Underlayers (ULs) and extrinsic anomalies in resist materials influence stochasticity through their interactions with molecular SCs. Interfacial defects are highly dependent on conditions of UL surface and sub-cluster formation. Extrinsic defects and resist fluctuations with a scale longer than the SC size generate defect floors or magnify stochastic defect probabilities, while those shorter than the SC size have little impact. Controlling sub-cluster requirements may help keep LWR and defect probability sufficiently low, but this generally is at the expense of resist sensitivity.", "The combination of High NA EUV anamorphic projection optics and unchanged mask-blank size result in a \u201cHigh NA field\u201d with a maximum size of 26x16.5 mm\u00b2 at wafer level. Therefore, to create a die larger than the High NA full field, two images are stitched together. So-called in-die stitching is enabled by a combination of design, mask, OPC, process, and scanner solutions. We present an overview of our learnings about at-resolution stitching based on a representative experimental study at NA=0.33, in preparation for tomorrow\u2019s NA=0.55. For a pitch 28nm vertical line-space, optimum conditions are confirmed experimentally to create a robust stitch. A P28 LS is measured post-stitching utilizing either a Ta absorber or a low-n absorber. For the latter, the higher reflectivity is experimentally mitigated by using sub-resolution-gratings. We also quantify the imaging impact of the transition between the absorber and the black border in the stitching region.", "The new high numerical aperture (NA) Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) with a NA of 0.55 is being developed at ASML, which is using an anamorphic projection system with the demagnification of 4\u00d7 in xdirection and 8\u00d7 in y-direction. Compared to the traditional 0.33NA EUV scanner with full-field image size of 26 \u00d7 33mm2, 0.55NA EUVL reduces the exposure field size to half-field (26 \u00d7 16.5mm2), due to this 8\u00d7 demagnification in y-direction and the reticle size remaining unchanged (six-inch square). Therefore, in-die stitching between two exposures is needed for the applications requiring larger than half-field size. To achieve in-die stitching in practical applications at advanced node, performing model based optical proximity correct (OPC) is an essential step. Therefore, a complete process modeling and OPC flow is required. To build an accurate OPC model, the interaction effects between two stitching fields require some special considerations, such as aerial image interaction, optical proximity effect among the stitching patterns, mask absorber reflection, black border proximity effect, as well as the stray light from the neighboring fields effect. All these effects must be captured by specific models. In this paper, we will investigate the in-die stitching effects and solutions through simulation and wafer data. Thus, to collect the wafer proof data, various stitching test patterns have been designed and placed on imec test masks, and the wafer data will be obtained on imec 0.33NA EUV scanner.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems have become one of the representative system nodes in the semiconductor industry. As EUV systems have been widely implemented to shrink integrated circuits, the importance of overlay control is increasing as much as patterning control. In terms of overlay control in lithography systems, a projection optics module is a key factor in determining the distortion of the overlay. In this paper, we present characteristics of EUV projection optics affecting overlay and propose a methodology predicting distortion of the overlay by calculating pattern shift using aberrations of EUV projection optics as an input. Also, the non-telecentricity of EUV systems is taken into account while calculating pattern shift as understanding the optical feature of EUV is required to explain the results of calculated distortion. Experimental results of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) devices are presented to understand different behaviors between the projection optics structure of DUV and EUV scanners.", "To enable cost-effective scaling of technology nodes and extend Moore\u2019s law for at least another decade, ASML has developed the High NA EUV platform.

There are two configurations of SLM: a tilt SLM, in which each micro-mirror pixel tilts to change the amplitude of reflected light; and a piston SLM in which each micro-mirror pixel moves along optical path to change the phase of reflected light. Both types are applicable for DS, but piston SLM has a better image contrast due to strong phase shift effect. A DS proof-of-concept tool (DS-POC) with piston SLM and exposure wavelength of 193 nm was developed, which has a similar imaging resolution with the DS248, a tool planned as the first DS product for lithography of 180 nm node or below.

Unlike plasma sources that emit incoherent light, FELs offer relatively coherent light with distinct characteristics including narrower bandwidth, higher repetition rates, and shorter pulse durations. This study elaborates on the integration process of FEL sources with existing scanner systems without necessitating modifications to the scanner\u2019s illumination or projection optics. We delve into the coherence and speckle considerations crucial for maintaining image quality and minimizing defects in photolithography. Our findings reveal that the spatio-temporal splitting of FEL pulses, facilitated by the scanner\u2019s illumination system, effectively mitigates coherence and speckle-related challenges. Moreover, the analysis of potential pulse damage reveals that despite the high peak power of FELs, the design of the scanner ensures that the risk of damage to optics is minimal. This research shows that it is practical and possible to use FEL sources in EUV scanners, enhancing their performance and efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing.", "An accelerator-based free electron laser (FEL) source of 13.5nm light can, among other benefits, provide more power, polarized light and no out-of-band radiation. This paper explores how the extra power, polarized light and lack of out-of-band radiation could be used in future scanner designs. The differences between light generated from a laser-produced plasma (LPP) source and an FEL source are discussed. Rigorous mask simulation, OPC and source optimization are used to assess the impacts of polarization on contrast and process window for lines/spaces and multiple 2D patterns. Polarization is shown to provide contrast and process window benefits at half-pitches below 8nm.

The NXE:3800E system marks a substantial step forward in scanner productivity, delivering a remarkable increase of (+60 WPH) in throughput, made possible by an increase in EUV source power (to >500W). This significant increase in power was achieved through improvements in the droplet generator, higher power CO2 drive laser, improved collector design, and enhancements in our plasma controls required for higher plasma power.

In addition, intra-field best focus shifts (BF) were reported. It called for a holistic assessment and control of total CD uniformity (CDU). In this work we expand the experimental validation total CDU in two ways (1) we study the local reticle variations and its translation to wafer variability by adding Aerial Image Measurement System (AIMS) into the metrology loop (2) we investigate if the observed best focus differences have impact on the 3D aspects of the resist: resist profile and local CDU at bottom and top of contact hole were measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).", "High-NA EUV lithography is being prepared for the next stage of volume production of state-of-the-art integrated devices. First wafer exposures on ASML\u2019s EXE5000 are expected early in 2024. Beyond assessment of the benefit of high-NA by simulation, ZEISS AIMS EUV offers the potential to compare the imaging benefit of 0.55NA to the established 0.33NA, through aerial image analysis of dedicated mask patterns. The recently available capability of high-NA imaging on AIMS\u00ae EUV was applied to compare options for imec\u2019s logic patterning roadmap, specifically for tip-to-tip structures (T2T). Beyond direct comparison of 0.33 and 0.55 NA, low-n absorber was compared to conventional Ta-based absorber. Moreover, in view of anamorphic imaging at high-NA, T2T pattern orientation was compared, i.e., either along the 4X exposure slit direction or along the 8X scan direction. Lastly pattern tonality, i.e., darkfield versus lightfield, were evaluated side by side. The comparisons were made for selected, yet not optimized, dipole-like sources. Beyond normalized intensity log-slope (NILS) for the line-space part, the through-focus analysis comprised ILS and required bias for shrinking T2T size. The results show that 0.55NA provides clear advantages, but their variation among absorber type, T2T pattern orientation and tonality highlight the potential of preferred combinations. Such are suggested as starting points for further optimization.", "EUV lithography has been introduced in semiconductor fabrication and maximizing yield and throughput is extremely important. One key enabler is the use of a high-transmission pellicle to hold particles out of the focal plane and thereby minimize their impact on imaging. Imec initiated the development of a promising pellicle based on a network of carbon nanotubes (CNT). This CNT membrane offers the advantage of very high EUV transmission (> 95 %) and durability compatible with the EUV scanner power roadmap. Moreover, wafer printing with a CNT pelliclized mask on ASML\u2019s EUV scanner at imec has been successfully demonstrated with good printing performance. Since the CNT pellicle is only a few tens of nanometers thick and suspended over an area of tens of centimeters, a major challenge of the pellicle is to control and optimize its mechanical stability and robustness when used in the EUV scanner. The pellicle rupture probability depends on a multitude of parameters, including pressure changes during mask loading and unloading, thermal expansion during exposure, initial stress/strain variations over the large pellicle, membrane degradation in the hydrogen plasma environment, and thickness of the pellicle. In this paper, the mechanical pellicle characterization as a function of the pressure changes for different CNT membranes is presented. The characterization is based on small-size sample evaluation using a bulge test method. By applying controlled plasma to such samples, it was possible to characterize the membranes not only as freshly fabricated but also after exposure to EUV scanner-like conditions. Additionally, the parameters obtained from small samples could be correlated to the actual movement during scanner manipulation. These measurements enable a fundamental understanding of CNT membranes and how they will behave in an industrial environment.", "Background: The increasing demands on computational lithography and computational imaging in the design and optimization of lithography processes necessitate rigorous modeling of EUV light diffracted from the mask. Traditional electromagnetic field (EMF) solvers are inefficient for large-scale technology problems, while deep neural networks rely on a huge amount of expensive rigorously simulated or measured data. Aim: In order to overcome these constraints, we explore the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) as a promising solution for addressing complex optical problems in the field of EUV lithography. Approach: We extend the existing MaxwellNet to simulate the light diffraction from typical reflective EUV masks. The coupling of the predicted diffraction spectrum with image simulations enables the evaluation of PINN performance in predicting relevant lithographic metrics and typical mask 3D effects. Results: The results of modeling near- and far-field diffraction using PINN showcase a good performance in terms of convergence behavior, stability, accuracy, and a significant speed-up (up to \u00d710000) compared to the rigorous 3D mask simulation using an established numerical EMF solver. In contrast to other machine learning approaches, PINN is able to accurately simulate the near field, learns the involved physics, and captures the optical and mask-induced 3D effects. PINNs can predict lithographic process windows with sufficient accuracy. Conclusions: Differently from numerical solvers, once trained, generalized PINN can simulate light scattering in several milliseconds without re-training and independently of problem complexity. This opens up the capabilities for partially coherent imaging simulations without the Hopkins approach, source optimization, and fast investigation of mask 3D effects.", "To print ever smaller features at high contrast, projection lithography technology has been developed to allow use of shorter wavelength light and to increase numerical aperture (NA) from 0.33 to 0.55. After enabling EUV wavelengths, to keep up with the scaling trends the industry would now again like to increase the NA. Since the depth of focus (DoF) is inversely proportional to the square of NA, in hyper NA EUV lithography (EUVL), we anticipate that the total available DoF in the lithography process would be further limited. Therefore, within the constrained DoF budget, it is necessary for lithographers to minimize the unwanted best focus (BF) variations generated from different pitches on a photomask. In this paper we identify how the mask 3D (M3D) effect induced BF variation through pitch behaves according to changes in the pattern orientation and mask tonality for hyper NA EUVL. We study how various focus shift mitigation strategies can be combined to align best focus and enhance the image contrast for hyper NA EUVL.", "Advanced packaging was applied during the early stages of CSWLP (Chip-Scale-Wafer-Level-Package) development for mainly package form-factor reduction.

Finally, we evaluate the benefit of using 3- High NA EUV lithography as a potential candidate for this type of layer.", "In FinFET transistors, the parasitic capacitance between the source/drain contact and the metal gate tends to be high, and this can negatively impact device performance. Adding a metal gate recess step can reduce capacitance, but unfortunately it also increases the metal gate resistance. By changing the metal gate recess profile, a good balance between resistance and capacitance can be achieved to reduce RC. In this work, we investigate FinFET metal gate recess profile settings and how changes in profile settings affect FinFET resistance and parasitic capacitance (R and C). Metal gate recess dimensional changes and profile changes can modify parasitic capacitance and impact electrical performance. We performed a virtual DOE where we varied the gate CD, recess depths, and metal gate recess profiles to understand the impact of these changes on FinFET resistance, capacitance, and electrical performance. Different recess profiles, such as sharp head and antenna shapes, were simulated using SEMulator3D\u00ae virtual process fabrication and pattern dependence modeling.

We replicated the process to calculate the resistance and capacitance for a GAAFET, and investigated performance trends during changes in gate CD, tungsten (W) etchback and recess profile variations.", "Stress technologies such as stress liners are used to improve the performance of advanced CMOS devices. Due to the contextual situation of a transistor in the physical design layout, unintended stress from neighboring cells can cause variations in the transistor characteristics. This effect is called Layout Dependent Effect (LDE). In this work we propose a fast method to detect outlier transistors due to the LDEs by profiling and sampling them from the VLSI design with millions of transistors and many devices. The proposed method can reduce the TAT for quantitative evaluation of the LDE for design layouts that have not passed the LVS. We also propose a pattern matching based method to search motifs created by encapsulating neighborhood of outlier transistors with large Vth variations. This enables designers to trace such LDE hotspot patterns and thereby outlier transistors during the design phase.", "As semiconductor industry transitions to EUV lithography in advanced technology nodes, EUV stochastic defects play a significant role in chip yield degradation.

Curvilinear shapes are classified into forms using Manhattan, rectilinear, and curvilinear representations. The primary objectives of employing curvilinear shapes in Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and mask technology are identified as error reduction and the effective representation of complex shapes. Leveraging the path optimization characteristic inherent in curvilinear shapes, their utilization was studied for semiconductor layout design. Standard cell design serves as a demonstrative example to highlight these benefits.

However, to enhance the effectiveness of DFM rules in addressing hotspots, it becomes imperative to encompass a broader array of design situations (layout contexts). This expansion leads to an increased number of potential fixing guidance \u201chints\u201d. Nonetheless, employing a static fixing hint order, unaware to the specific in-design topologies, can potentially diminish the output metrics i.e., fixing rate and runtime performance. In pursuit of optimizing these output metrics, we present an ML-powered PBLO workflow. In this innovative approach, a Machine Learning (ML) model is trained using an extensive dataset of preranked fixing guidance hints that are associated with a DFM rule. The topology aware supervised ML model is trained to dynamically guide and select the most suitable in-design fixing guidance order per situation, ultimately leading to an improved fixing rate, runtime and quality of results.

On top of the newer device architectures and materials, several other CMOS scaling boosters are being considered, and can help in further to improve the power, performance and area scaling. Backside power delivery network (BSPDN) is one of the promising scaling boosters, e.g. it disengages metal routing resources from the frontside, resulting in a lower routing congestion. Hence, the BSPDN booster paves the way for higher frequency and lower area footprint. However, ad-hoc standard cell design and optimization is required to connect the BSPDN network to the logic devices located in the front-end-of-line (FEOL).

The different implications on standard cell design, as cell track height, routing and main process challenges are then compared to the classic frontside power delivery option. Finally, high-density (HD) standard cell libraries are implemented and characterized. Normalized area and delay comparisons at the library-level are presented.

Customized devices play a critical role in achieving precision models. Having no additional or missing shapes in the region of customized devices is expected in order to keep the precision of models. To address this challenge, a robust methodology with an assistive debugging approach is required. Synopsys IC Validator Pattern Matching offers a solution that not only meets these requirements but also simplifies customized device representation and includes a user-friendly visualized debugger for efficient shape mismatch identification. The article provides a concise explanation of the device extraction flow with pattern matching (Figure 1), emphasizing the use of a pattern library containing source patterns. Pattern matching generates optional marker layers at matched locations by utilizing the pattern library in conjunction with the input design. In the context of Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) flow, the pattern library's source patterns consist of device layers like poly, active, and related layers, which form body and terminal layers. Pattern matching facilitates the extraction of body and terminal layers at matched devices, while any mismatch leads to missing device layers and their absence from the netlist. The effectiveness of IC Validator in delivering expected LVS results is demonstrated through the verification of live designs provided by customers, successfully identifying LVS fails for various design scenarios, including extra/missing/relocated polygons in the device region, extra connections to the outside of the device region, extra connections crossing the device region, pin swapping, and more.

During DTCO (Design-Technology Co-Optimization) activity, BEOL geometries can be explored to achieve target PPA (Power-Performance-Area). To improve design's PPA, wire delay per unit distance can be reduced by increasing the metal width and spacing with given metal thickness. But increasing metal width and spacing can negatively affect the performance of the design as wire track resources per unit area reduced. Strengthening PDN (Power Delivery Network) can improve IR-drop of design, but also impact design's PPA negatively by consuming BEOL resource more. In this paper, application-driven metal stack and PDN optimization using ML (Machine-Learning) technique presented to address the issue effectively. To optimize metal stack and PDN, parameters of layer sheet count per thickness, pitch, spacing, and PDN horizontal/Vertical pitches are explored by Synopsys DSO.ai ML framework. DSO.ai optimization is constrained to maximize achieved frequency while maintaining certain IR-drop target.

This is better frequency improvement than +1.4% of achieved frequency while 2.5% worse IR-drop from closest space where the DTCO done by human experts.", "In modern digital integrated-circuit designs, standard-cell libraries are critical foundations. Transistor sizing can help determine an optimal set of transistor sizes of the standard-cell circuit under specified design constraints and desired circuit optimization goals. The conventional equation-based approaches can cause significant electric characteristic deviation, and the simulation-based approaches may be severely restricted by initial values. Recently, we proposed an improved transistor sizing method to compensate for the drawbacks. However, it did not consider the layout-dependent lithography effects. The printed wafer patterns can suffer from significant geometric distortions when layout geometry shrinks. It is worth investigating the lithography effects to ensure that the electrical characteristics of the manufactured devices can still meet the target design specifications. This work extends the effectiveness verification of the improved transistor sizing method by further considering the lithography effects. An in-house lithography simulation tool is utilized to generate wafer patterns. The electrical characteristics of transistors with non-rectangular gate shapes due to the lithography distortion are analyzed through different equivalent-gate-length estimation methods.

Especially, we focus ~nm devices adapting 3D-interconnection technology and scheme. In 3D-interconnection technology and scheme, Wafer to Wafer(W2W) bonding process are necessary harnessed. Unfortunately, it naturally induce large stress and distortion which are very sensitive to extrinsic and intrinsic property of wafer(i.e. initial warpage, thin film profile, wafer modulus). These wafer stress and distortion become a high risk in reducing overlay, as the cell size of device shrink. Thus, in development of ~nm devices, main key is to find effective and efficient method of wafer engineering reducing wafer stress and distortion. In order to handle this risk, we suggest and develop Angle-ply Laminating Wafers with heterogeneous crystal-structure, which is based on Classical Lamination Plate Theory(CLPT) in the area of advanced solid mechanics. By utilizing this design concept, anisotropic modulus of top and bottom wafer balance under W2W bonding process. As a result, it induce stress relaxation, distortion and reduce overlay. To verify it rigorously, we introduce the wafer stiffness tailoring method based on CLPT; and construct the simulation model predicting the W2W bonding distortion and photo overlay. We develop the W2W bonding simulation model based on framework of multiscale analysis and pre-verified by comparing with experiment results, which relate to the initial warpage effect on overlay and the thin film profile effect on bondability.

It is observed that the use of 3D-integration schemes, can reduce the overall die cost at same functionality, paving the way for cost-effective scaling solutions in future technologies.", "With advanced semiconductor technologies continuing to evolve, defect prediction has experienced increased challenges because process issues involve complex interactions of multiple-layer layout patterns. This makes it more challenging than before for traditional pattern search techniques to identify, predict, and fix the process issues in a short time. Also, due to the increased cycle time to introduce new semiconductor technologies, for Integrated Circuit (IC) design houses with early technology engagements, finding potential defects in these new technologies and improving design quality become more challenging than before. Oftentimes utilization of previous learning experience for detecting and reducing defects becomes unavoidable. To overcome these difficulties, a feature-based artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) defect prediction tool has been developed and utilized to improve the prediction of potential process defects for IC designs. With this tool and its workflow, with the previous technology process improvement learning experience, the defect patterns are generated to improve design qualities for the new technology. The tool also provides functions of clustering and compressing the predicted defect patterns that facilitate finding root causes of the process defects. This paper will describe the new defect prediction flow, especially using previous technology process improvement data to analyze similar issues in the current technology designs.", "Post-exposure bake (PEB) consists of neutralization, diffusion, and catalysis steps, and are modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs). Commercial PEB simulation relies on numerical methods to explicitly solve PDEs in both spatial and temporal domains, and is very time consuming. A machine learning model has been applied to quickly predict the final inhibitor distribution with initial acid distribution as a model input. The accuracy, however, is not good enough; for different PEB condition comprising baking time and temperature, the model should be trained again, which is another limitation. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed for fast PEB simulation. The network is constructed around convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM), which is a popular RNN for spatio-temporal prediction. Key inputs of convLSTM include the encoded values of acid and quencher distributions as well as their multiplication; acid and quencher distributions on next time step are obtained after the outputs of convLSTM pass through decoders. Once acid distribution is derived at time instance of interest, inhibitor distribution is extracted directly from its PDE. To accelerate RNN prediction, operations are skipped and the distribution at the next time step is simply copied from the one at the current time step if PEB reaction does not occur. Experiments have shown that the runtime of PEB simulation is reduced by 88.1% with smaller total PDE loss by 35.3%, compared to commercial tool.", "For advanced technology nodes, it\u2019s critical to utilize resolution enhancement technique (RET) methods to improve pattern fidelity and wafer yield. Conventional techniques including rule-based SRAF (RB-SRAF) and model-based SRAF (MBSRAF) methods have been widely adopted to increase the manufacturing process window. ILT delivers superior imaging performance compared to both RB-SRAF and MB-SRAF methods, at the expense of slower performance and more inconsistency issue. Recent advancement of machine learning techniques opens up new gateways for more RET enhancements by overcoming these challenges, thus providing a pathway to extend ILT solution to full chip design. In this paper, we developed an end-to-end flow that seamlessly incorporated model training and application for full chip ILT MBSRAF generation and optimization via POLY-GAN, a new Generative Adversarial network (GAN) geared for fast, in-context and accurate ILT MB-SRAF synthesis. An image based deep learning architecture similar to pix2pix conditional GAN was utilized in our study. In this paper, we demonstrate that ML based full chip ILT MBSRAF generation yields superior process window compared to rule based SRAF generation, while maintaining comparable run-time performance.", "Mask 3D (M3D) effects distort diffraction amplitudes from EUV masks. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations are used to rigorously calculate the distorted diffraction amplitudes. However, EM simulations are highly time consuming for OPC applications. The distorted diffraction amplitude can be characterized by M3D parameters. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which predicts M3D parameters very fast from input mask patterns. In this work, we train CNN using test mask data with various characteristics of metal layers. The accuracy of the CNN is good for the test mask data. However, when we use new mask data that mimic device patterns, the accuracy of the CNN is worsened. Starting from the CNN pre-trained by the test mask data, we improve the accuracy of the CNN by additional training using larger dataset including both the test mask data and the new mask data. The accuracy of the CNN is slightly improved by the fine tuning.", "The rapid evolution of the electronics industry, driven by Moore\u2019s law and the proliferation of integrated circuits, has led to significant advancements in modern society, including the Internet, wireless communication, and artificial intelligence (AI). Central to this progress is optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing that accounts for approximately 30% to 40% of production costs. As semiconductor nodes shrink and transistor numbers increase, optical lithography becomes increasingly vital in current integrated circuit (IC) fabrication technology. This paper introduces an open-source differentiable lithography imaging framework that leverages the principles of differentiable programming and the computational power of GPUs to enhance the precision of lithography modeling and simplify the optimization of resolution enhancement techniques (RETs). The framework models the core components of lithography as differentiable segments, allowing for the implementation of standard scalar imaging models, including the Abbe and Hopkins models, as well as their approximation models. The paper introduces a computational lithography framework that optimizes semiconductor manufacturing processes using advanced computational techniques and differentiable programming. It compares imaging models and provides tools for enhancing resolution, demonstrating improved semiconductor patterning performance. The open-sourced framework represents a significant advancement in lithography technology, facilitating collaboration in the field. The source code is available at https://github.com/TorchOPC/TorchLitho.", "Contour-based OPC modeling has recently arisen as an alternative to the conventional CD-based method. In this work, an innovative flow is proposed to improve the quality of the final calibrated model by using SEM image contours. Layout pattern sampling technique should be introduced into this flow, which could not only ensure adequate coverage including IPS and pattern diversity, but also minimize the data collection effort. In this study, we have developed an automated high-precision contour extraction method to obtain good and reliable contours that were in good agreement with traditional CD-SEM measurements. The OPC model calibration was built by using the high-precision SEM contours, and we compared the contour-based method with conventional CD measurements. Finally, the model error RMS of the calibration and verification process could be fed back to the layout pattern sampling, which could benefit the sustainable improvement of the predictive ability of the model.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) with a NA of 0.33 has been part of high-volume manufacturing since 2019. To guarantee the downscaling of the technology node, advanced material and patterning becomes very critical in terms of resolution, roughness, defectivity and process window. Therefore, several entities are developing new resists and processes. However, to adopt new resist and process into the production, performing model based optical proximity correct (OPC) is an essential step. Thus, an accurate OPC model is required. In this paper, we investigate the calibre CM1 OPC model accuracy of dry resist process, which is conducted on N5 M2 design (pitch 32nm).", "In this work we introduce an Inverse Lithography Mask Design (ILMD) framework for Displacement Talbot Lithography (DTL), an emerging photolithography technique utilized especially for various photonic applications. Image formation process in DTL differs from projection or proximity lithography techniques. In DTL, the printed pattern is generally not an \u201cimage\u201d of the mask in any common sense of the word, as there exists a rather complex relationship between the mask and wafer patterns. This has prevented the use of DTL for printing patterns other than simple shapes such as circles or squares up to now, as there are no obvious solutions to even start from, like those that exist for projection or proximity methods. Our ILMD framework, powered by an optimization method overcomes this hurdle. It takes a targeted wafer pattern as the input and yields potential mask geometries as the output. To verify the efficacy of the ILMD framework, we designed DTL masks for a variety of complex geometries. We realized a number of the resulting mask layouts using standard fabrication methods and used them in DTL exposures to print the intended patterns. The validity and accuracy of the ILMD framework was confirmed by SEM imaging of the printed patterns. This work proves the general capability of DTL\u2019s underlying optical principles to produce complex periodic patterns. It significantly broadens the application scope of the DTL technique by providing a practical and efficient design route.", "One of the key methods targeted for continuing the resolution scaling in new device technology nodes is the trend towards using curvilinear mask patterns. With recent advances in multi-beam mask patterning and large-scale adoption of ILT mask data correction, curvilinear (and all-angle) mask patterns are considered today as a mainstream technology option. Curvilinear mask patterns provide improved wafer resolution and OPC/ILT mask correction control with reduced mask manufacturing issues related to tight corners and line-ends. However, OPC, ILT, LRC and other full-chip simulation-based mask synthesis methods also require more accurate electromagnetic (i.e., M3D) simulation for new technology nodes. Prior full-chip electromagnetic simulation methods have often assumed that mask patterns are restricted to Manhattan geometries or utilize limited angles. Therefore, there is a general industry need for improved electromagnetic full-chip simulation methods for curvilinear mask patterns. This paper will present a new electromagnetic full-chip simulation method for curvilinear mask patterns that will improve the accuracy of mask synthesis methods at upcoming technology nodes. This method can provide both accuracy and speed benefits on mask synthesis with curvilinear mask patterns for both DUV and EUV lithography. The method utilizes an enhanced physics-based treatment of electromagnetic mask scattering both tuned and verified by rigorous electromagnetic Maxwell\u2019s equation solvers.", "Advanced computational lithography requires growing compute power and increased flexibility which can be easily accessed on Cloud.

In this presentation I will be focusing on the challenges facing both optical proximity correction (OPC) and etch compensation for silicon photonics designs versus conventional CMOS designs.", "As layout schemes become increasingly complex for advanced technology nodes, challenges such as large edge placement error (EPE) and poor OPC convergence in optical proximity correction (OPC) can lead to significant yield losses. To overcome these issues, widely adopted strategies include layout re-targeting before OPC and mask feature modification after OPC for mask synthesis. The former entails adjusting the after-development inspection critical dimension (ADI CD) target of the original design layout. However, this process often relies on a time-consuming trial-and-error iterative approach to determine optimal sizing values for specific layouts. In recent years, machine learning techniques have shown promise in computational lithography, offering efficiency improvements. Leveraging the advantages of machine learning for guidance on layout re-targeting has the potential to reduce turnaround time. This paper presents a methodology that incorporates deep generative models into the layout re-targeting flow to propose proper sizing values for the layout of 3D NAND channel holes. Initially, we train two different deep generative models, namely Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the Diffusion Model. These models are employed to infer sizing values for pre-OPC patterns through model prediction, utilizing input error data. Subsequently, the inferred sizing values are input into the design rule check (DRC) commands for polygon movement. Experimental results demonstrate that both deep generative models can predict layout sizing in the re-targeting flow, resulting in significantly improved accuracy of ADI CD and reduced turnaround time compared to the traditional trial-and-error approach.", "As Moore\u2019s Law continues to increase the complexity of electronic systems, Electronic Design Automation (EDA) must advance to meet global demand. An important example of an EDA technology is SKILL, a scripting language used to customize and extend EDA software. Recently, code generation models using the transformer architecture have achieved impressive results in academic settings and have even been used in commercial developer tools to improve developer productivity. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply transformers to SKILL code autocompletion towards improving the productivity of hardware design engineers. In this study, a novel, data-efficient methodology for generating SKILL code is proposed and experimentally validated. More specifically, we propose a novel methodology for (i) creating a high-quality SKILL dataset with both unlabeled and labeled data, (ii) a training strategy where T5 models pre-trained on general programming language code are fine-tuned on our custom SKILL dataset using self-supervised and supervised learning, and (iii) evaluating synthesized SKILL code. We show that models trained using the proposed methodology outperform baselines in terms of human-judgment score and BLEU score. A major challenge faced was the extremely small amount of available SKILL code data that can be used to train a transformer model to generate SKILL code. Despite our validated improvements, the extremely small dataset available to us was still not enough to train a model that can reliably autocomplete SKILL code. We discuss this and other limitations as well as future work that could address these limitations.", "The need for resolution scaling in new device technology nodes is a long-standing trend in semiconductor patterning. As DUV lithography will not go beyond the current 1.35NA and high-NA EUV lithography has not yet been introduced intro production, fabs are pushing to achieve higher resolution in upcoming device nodes by lowering the lithographic k1. DUV lithography is being pushed well below the 80nm minimum pitch value and EUV lithography is also being pushed to continue shrinking beyond current pitch limits. Lower k1 lithography causes increased sensitivity to process variations but tighter EPE control is required in new nodes. Consequently, new methods for improving EPE control and reducing lithographic errors and hotspots are needed well beyond current 2D compact resist modeling applications. This paper discusses new improvements in EPE control and hotspot reduction by improving the accuracy of full-chip three-dimensional (3D)-aware resist compact modeling. These improvements are enabled by better integration and learning for compact models with rigorous 3D resist models that take advantage of enhancements in traditional and machine-learning modeling as well as data handling.", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology enables further downscaling for logic and memory designs. This powerful technology comes with new challenges that must be controlled to unlock the novel technology accuracy and capabilities. Freeform (curvilinear) masks introduce a flexible tape-out capability that enables customers to realize EUV technology accuracy and capabilities on wafer. However, the accuracy enhancements of curvilinear masks do not come free of challenges. Source optimization, optical proximity correction (OPC) and verification runtime, mask proximity correction (MPC) runtime, data volume handling at fracture, and finally mask writing time are some of these challenges. In this paper, we present an affordable runtime tape-out flow for optical proximity correction and verification. This tapeout flow connects the capabilities of different engines to balance accuracy and mask turnaround time. Combining the benefits of rigorous solvers and pattern matching with affordable OPC, mask rule check (MRC) and verification capabilities cut down mask turnaround time from weeks to days, offering customers cutting edge technology on wafers with acceptable runtime. In this paper, we present a new flow for EUV freeform OPC with demonstrated runtime and accuracy benefits validated on wafer", "In this paper we will evaluate the impact of stitching on process window and show how EDA can help to improve the manufacturability of stitched layers. More specifically, we demonstrate modeling of double exposure effects suitable for full-field correction and verification that incorporates aerial image cross-talk, optical black border transitions, subresolution gratings, sub-resolution assist-features and long-range flare. We also evaluate how stitching impacts different high NA processes and how correction of these effects (ex. via optical proximity correction, inverse lithography technology) can be used to increase process robustness. Finally, we examine the impact of stitched pattern overlap to process window and how loss of process window due to stitching can be mitigated.", "In this paper, we present a rigorous simulation engine for DSA chemo-epitaxy patterning processes. The model can be utilized to predict the post-process patterns for line space and hexagonal hole layouts. Traditional pitch-split and EUV pattern rectification process integration schemes are simulated. The model output for Line Edge Roughness (LER) and Pattern Placement Error (PPE) is compared to the experimental results. Finally, we will explore how to enable DSA-aware process-compliant designs, taking into account cut-mask considerations in the context of design rules.", "High numerical aperture (NA) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography single patterning is evaluated through source mask optimization (SMO). The patterning performance is assessed on random logic metal design with minimum pitches of 24, 22, and 20nm in the horizontal direction to confirm the feasibility of logic metal scaling. We set a 1 square micron as a cell window and choose 200 gauges to include various types of features such as dense, isolated, and tip-to-tip. SMO is performed assuming eight permutations of a) dark-field versus bright-field, b) Ta-based versus low-n attenuated phaseshift masks, and c) with sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF) versus without SRAF. For each design, the process window is estimated.", "Grayscale lithography (GL) is a well-suited technique to manufacture 3D micro objects, such as micro-lens, in a single lithography step. The current method to realize GL masks is limited to square pattern masks and suffers from a high computational cost. This article introduces a deep learning workflow to generate free-form masks for GL. The proposed workflow is composed of five main steps: the dataset generation, the neural network training and inference, the post-treatment and its evaluation. With this method, quality index for 3D simulated objects is equivalent to the current iterative computational method and the computation time is reduced at the same time.", "Computational technologies are still in the course of development for nanoimprint lithography (NIL). Only a few simulators are applicable to the nanoimprint process, and these simulators are desired by device manufacturers as part of their daily toolbox. The most challenging issue in NIL process simulation is the scale difference of each component of the system. The template pattern depth and the residual resist film thickness are generally of the order of a few tens of nanometers, while the process needs to work over the entire shot size, which is typically of the order of 10 mm square. This amounts to a scale difference of the order of 106 . Therefore, in order to calculate the nanoimprint process with conventional fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulators, an enormous number of meshes is required, which results in computation times that are unacceptable. To support all lithographic systems, Canon has introduced \u201cLithography Plus\u201d, a software solution capable of anomaly detection, automatic recovery, trouble flow prediction and remote support. The software is now under development specifically for NIL. Because NIL is a rheological process, to software must address a completely new work flow. In this paper, we introduce the methods used to create drop patterns and refinements to the NIL process simulator which can be applied to predict resist filling and, in the future, be used to make corrections to the drop pattern virtually, thereby eliminating time consuming on-tool verification. Finally, we discuss the development of virtual metrology software that incorporates artificial intelligence to provide fast feedback on key tool outputs such as overlay.", "A pattern replacement in-design auto-fixing methodology, called MAS-POP, is developed to increase the scores calculated by the Manufacturability Analysis and Scoring (MAS) tool, improving the compliance with DFM rules. A library of patterns is developed using pattern classification automation, converting multiple types of Back-End-Of-Line (BEOL) DFM rules to patterns: via-metal line end enclosure, metal 2 tip-to-tip spacing, and metal area. Corresponding fixing hints are prescribed for each pattern. Once the library of patterns and the associated fixing hints have been developed, they are integrated with the router to utilize its pattern replacement feature. This insertion identifies matching patterns and fixes the violations by applying the prescribed fixing hints, improving the usage of the DFM rules and enhancing the MAS scores. The MAS-POP methodology is demonstrated on routed designs. Results show that for a 200 x 200 um2 block, three via-metal line end enclosure patterns reduce the number of DFM violations from 12.5k to 360 on one 2x metal layer, with a small runtime impact.", "The yield of the deep sub-micron semiconductor is secured by the process capability as well as the yield-friendly design capability. Yield-friendly design capabilities can be equipped with conventional Design for Manufacturability (DFM) that avoids already known defective layouts in design. Previously known defects can be defined as various rules and avoided in design, but defects that may occur at new technology nodes are difficult to avoid in advance. Indiscreetly defect-avoidance designs cause turn TAT increases and Power/Performance/Area (PPA) overheads in the design, which can ultimately lead to increased design costs and poor design competitiveness. The first step of this study is to predict potential risks and to specify major factor of risks that may occur at new process nodes with new DFM solutions developed using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The second step is to secure early yield through avoidance design to prevent predicted defects and direct mask modification to improve defects. In this study, we present not only the introduction of new ML-based DFM solutions, but also the effect of predicting and improving defects through the application cases of real products.", "A digital twin is a numerical copy of an asset or a process, used to predict its physical behavior over time. Usually, a digital twin is based on physical models, constructed by simulating its different parts. It is then used to monitor and act on systems, based on digital state information, which is computed from real sensors data that feed the digital twin. Among the usages, we can cite predictive maintenance, planification, root cause analysis among others. We propose to adapt the technology to monitor and model complex processes by data driven, it can also be used in complement of physical simulation. Our proposal is a framework to create Artificial Intelligence (AI) models based on experimental data, then simulate new recipes and optimize the process, including constraints defined by the Process Engineer. AI models can be enriched with physical models; when available, they are used to create additional training data and to compare AI models with simulation. AI models require clean data, this procedure is tedious and time consuming. Depending on the process, it can be simplified by proposing automatic processes to clean and arrange data so that it can be used directly for training. The use of AI in comparison to classical physical models allows users to identify bias in their selection of parameters. It is used as a proxy for accurate optimization of the process under constraints. It can also serve to explore more efficiently the parameters space, by avoiding experiments that would lead to low performances. Finally, several tools are proposed to improve the understanding of the complete process and visualize the relationships between parameters and characteristics of the product. We propose an experimental setup using physical simulations of semiconductor materials to demonstrate the use of our digital twin pipeline.", "In prior work, as a means to overcome computational cost while maintaining similar ILT lithographic quality, we presented full-chip layout synthesis with curve-based OPC as a complimentary option with curvilinear ILT. However, there are an increasing number of different quality determinations, cost constraints and orthogonal solutions needed for curvilinear mask and target correction to meet the requirements for different layers (L/S, CH/Via/Cut-mask), devices (logic, DRAM, Flash) and lithographic applications (DUV, EUV, photonics, flat-panel display, High NA EUV), etc. In this paper, we will share a spectrum of advances for curvilinear masks and targets by ILT, and integrated curve-based ILT/OPC.

Additionally, we will also describe new advancements in adjacent areas of the curvilinear mask ecosystem for MRC, MEC, etch and data volume reduction.", "Low-cost and high-precision fabrication of surface relief gratings on AR/VR waveguide combiners is one of the critical steps in realizing devices suitable for mass adoption. Displacement Talbot Lithography (DTL) has emerged as a viable technology that relies on the proven optical lithography approach of the semiconductor industry while offering a low-cost solution for large area printing of periodic structures of the kind required on waveguides. However, patterning with DTL differs from the common projection photolithography approaches in terms of the optical concepts used in printing an image in a photoresist layer. A key capability required for mass adoption is accurate simulation support for faster integration, process optimization, and mask design. Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools are common for projection approaches and can now be used to understand DTL interactions with waveguide designs. This approach relies on three specific Synopsys modeling tools, namely S-Litho and RSoft Photonic Device Tools in conjunction with LightTools which are used for optimization of the photolithographic printing process (DTL) and the optical performance of the printed device (waveguide), respectively. A dedicated suite for modelling the DTL process within the S-Litho software was developed for this purpose. The model is calibrated and optimized using actual printing results in photoresist layers obtained through the DTL process. In this presentation we will show results of this new method that combines the optimization of DTL lithographic printing and optical performance of the resulting waveguide. The combination of the unique DTL solution and the comprehensive simulation capabilities holds great promise for accelerating the development and commercialization of AR devices.", "Curvilinear(CL) mask shapes have showed better lithography performance, including improved process window, better PVband and MEEF compared to Manhattan mask. With the development of Multi-Beam-Mask-Writer (MBMW), the adoption of CL mask in production becomes reality. However, there are multiple challenges associated with CL data, such as complex mask shape and large data volume. One of the most important challenges is to have a good set of Mask-Rule-Check(MRC) rules which is essential to achieve good OPC mask quality. Calibre\u00ae OPCVerify has been developed for years to check CL shapes. Combining with existing checks, a full suite of CL MRC checks has been added.

A substantial simulation results comprising linewidth, pitch, and corresponding etch bias data for one-dimensional layouts was collected. Subsequently, we employed the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method, to construct the etch bias prediction model. Random Forest effectively captures the intricate relationships between linewidth, pitch, and etch bias by combining multiple decision trees.

In parallel to advancements in the lithographic system, the development of suitable photoresists plays an equally important role in pushing the boundaries of EUV lithography. Fundamental work on well-established chemically amplified resists (CAR) for EUV as well as the upcoming resists based on metal-organic materials have indicated that the lithographic mechanism is largely governed by electron mediated chemistry. In a simplified model, the electrons emitted upon ionization of the material generate further secondary electrons, which interact with the resist components and induce a solubility switch driven by electron and radiation chemistry. To develop a better performing resist, it is of utmost importance to understand the photoelectron kinetic energy spectrum, secondary electrons and their generation efficiency, and the electron mean free path in the photoemission process. In this work, we use photoemission spectroscopy with a table-top, coherent, 92 eV photon source to shed light on the chemistry driven by photon exposure. The valence band photoelectron spectrum (PES) of an environmentally stable chemically amplified photoresist (ESCAP), as well as a model material for an open-source metal oxide (OSMO) resist were measured using our tabletop EUV photoemission setup. We report the evolution of the PES as a function of exposure dose; capturing chemical changes.", "We have studied the gradient of photoacid generator (PAG) concentration across the photoresist (PR) layer. The pristine and after exposure to Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) PR layers were characterized. The model resist employed in this study was a chemically amplified resist (CAR) containing sulfur (S) as part of the PAG. The geometrical information about PR layers and element profiles was obtained by applying a hybrid x-ray reflectivity (XRR) and X-ray standing wave (XSW) data analysis using x-ray using a laboratory Cu K\u03b11 source. The information about S-profile was retrieved from the combined analysis of angular-dependent XRF measurements of S (the XSW data) and XRR data. We have shown that the XSW technique may efficiently be used for analyses of the geometrical parameters of PR layers and underlayers and for retrieving profiles of S concentration.", "Depth profile of the dopant concentration in silicon substrate has a crucial influence on the electric characteristics that defines the device performance, whereas those profile has only been evaluated by destructive methods, most typically Secondary-Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). We applied Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy (TES) that exploits charge carrier drift within the built-in potential structure to p-n junction structure in order to non-destructively extract the information about carrier dynamics and consequently the dopant profile. We prepared samples composed of Boron doped region as a p-Si and Phosphor doped region as a n-Si with a different p-n junction depth, and the TES evaluation was conducted illuminating the pump beam with the wavelength of 400nm. The obtained signals exhibit a clear difference among each sample in spite of the junction depth difference of as small as 15nm. The depth sensitivity of TES measurement was also investigated by utilizing carrier dynamics simulation, and clearly indicates the sensitivity to dopant depth profile, which is consistent with experimental TES signal. These results suggest that TES technology is very promising as in-line dopant profile measurement tool which is currently unrealistic with existing technologies and expected to greatly enhance the process control capability.", "A key element of semiconductor fabrication is the precise deposition of thin films. Amongst other aspects, the quality of interfaces between different materials plays a crucial role for the success of further process steps. We here present soft x-ray reflectometry measurements on stacked thin film samples of silicon and silicon-germanium in various concentrations as they are produced for complementary field-effect transistor (CFET) applications. Synchrotron-based, angle- and energy-resolved broadband reflectance data sets can be modeled using a matrix-method approach that describes reflection, absorption, and diffuse scattering off the interfaces. This method is often used to determine the optical constants of materials in the EUV spectral region as parameters of the fitting procedure. We here show that the method is equally well suited to investigate roughness and layer intermixing between different deposited materials. These roughness parameters alongside the actual thicknesses of the individual layers also result from the physical modelling of the measured data. The method is inherently non-destructive and very sensitive, down to approximately 50nm depth and as such gives valuable information. To further qualify our findings, we compare the data to scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) to give insight into the atomic structure at the interfaces.", "This paper demonstrates the successful lab-to-fab transition of dynamic secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). In comparison to traditional lab SIMS, the in-line version is optimized for automated wafer and measurement sequence handling and high throughput measurements in small areas. Key advantages are fast turn-around time, reduced scrap, increased yield, and the measured wafer can continue processing in the manufacturing line. The benefits of in-line SIMS in the production environment are demonstrated for several use cases: matching and monitoring the long-term stability of epitaxy tools on monitor wafers, process optimization and monitoring of epitaxial Si and SiGe layers on blanket and patterned wafers with blanket metrology targets, measurement of implant and dopant profiles on blanket and patterned wafers, and characterization of the Ge and B diffusion in multi-layer stacks stimulated by high-temperature annealing. Additionally, the characterization of the source/drain epitaxy in a fully integrated nanosheet gate-all-around transistor architecture is demonstrated and discussed. The results are compared to off-line lab SIMS and alternative methods where available.", "Here we examine a new methodology for spatially resolved molecular analysis to address an important area of need related to the performance of EUV resists, namely detection of molecular components at a scale below the current 20 nm critical dimension. Analysis consists of stochastically sampling the surface with a suite of nano projectiles each of which results in the emission of multiple secondary ions, SIs, from a volume 10-15 nm in diameter on the surface. The SI detector is a multi-anode detector allowing for the radial and translational energies of each SI to be examined. We tested this new methodology on model line patterned EUV resist materials and found the when bombarding the surface with the primary ion path perpendicular to the line pattern, impacts on top of the intact resist resulted in the emission of SI with high translational and axial energies in the forward direction. In contrast, impacts which occurred on the resist sidewalls results in emission in the backward direction. Thus, by examining the energies of emitted SIs molecular analysis can be undertaken on each part of the pattern (side wall, intact resist, substrate) with high resolution.", "The adoption of EUV lithography has enabled the reduction of device dimensions; however, the commensurate scaling of variability, such as line edge and width roughness (LER/LWR), has remained elusive. Understanding the origins of these effects has proven challenging, as they cannot be detected until after the final dissolution step. In this study, we present our recent findings using critical-dimension resonant soft X-ray scattering (CD-RSoXS) to investigate the scattering behavior of photoresist materials. Our primary objective is to gain insights into the contributions of each process step to the generation of LER/LWR as well as footing/scumming. RSoXS capitalizes on tunable soft X-ray sources to significantly enhance the scattering cross-sections from heterogeneous materials. This enhancement provides valuable insights into sub-nanometer spatial resolution and local chemical sensitivity concurrently. To extract a comprehensive profile of the latent image, we employ simulations involving the form factor and subsequent reconstruction of line shapes.", "In the field of semiconductor manufacturing, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is employed for critical dimension (CD) measurements, overlay measurements, and defect inspections to ensure the quality and reliability of semiconductor devices. Nevertheless, SEM images inherently carry a significant level of noise, leading to inaccurate metrology and false defect inspections. Therefore, it is crucial to develop denoising techniques. One widely used method is frame averaging, which reduces cumulative noise by averaging multiple scans. While increasing scan times enhances SEM image quality, it comes with drawbacks such as surface charging, pattern shrinkage, and reduced throughput. Deep learning (DL) techniques, including supervised and unsupervised approaches, have shown remarkable progress in the field of SEM image denoising. However, supervised methods are notably affected by phenomena such as pattern shrinkage and surface charging, which occur during the capture of reference images. On the other hand, unsupervised methods are typically more effective with lower noise levels. In this paper, we introduced a flexible DL method for denoising SEM images that operates without the requirement for paired data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we analyzed and evaluated its performance in two metrology tasks. Experimental results validated the efficacy of our method in reducing noise, demonstrating its applicability to both ADI and AEI.", "We propose a robust dynamic spectroscopic imaging ellipsometer (DSIE) as a future high-throughput full pattern wafer inspection candidate in semiconductor MI fields. In this study, we demonstrate a Linnik-type monolithic polarizing interferometer scheme combined with a simple spectrometer-based compensation channel can enhance system robustness and stability drastically. Also, we address the importance of the global mapping phase error compensation method by which highly reliable 3-D cubic spectroscopic ellipsometric parameter mapping capability can be provided for a large-scale specimen. To show the efficacy of the proposed compensation method experimentally, we measure a 12-inch full size silicone-dioxide thin film and a 8-inch nano-pattern wafer in a general environment where various external disturbances can affect the system stability.", "Non-destructive nano-metrology is a fundamental tool for semiconductor device manufacturing. Practically, a combination of several metrology techniques is needed throughout the fabrication process of semiconductor chips, from EUV photomask inspection to patterned wafer metrology. EUV light not only facilitates the production of smaller features in lithography but also emerges as a powerful approach for the metrology required to characterize and analyze these intricate features in future technology nodes, thanks to its short wavelength, relevant penetration depth, and high reflectivity with relatively high grazing angles compared to that of x-rays. The reflective grazing incidence nanoscope for EUV (REGINE) at the Swiss Light Source is a prototype platform for reflectometry, scatterometry, and coherent diffraction imaging. It operates in the soft x-ray and EUV region (80 to 200 eV photon energy), and covers a grazing incidence angle range of 0\u00b0 to 28.6\u00b0. REGINE provides the possibility to perform grazing incidence reflectometry and scatterometry for semiconductor metrology. In this study, we present the results of optical constants (n and k) determination and layer thickness characterization with reflectometry procedure for an EUV attenuated phase shifting mask blank, and the analysis of scatterometry results of line-space grating profile reconstruction and overlay measurement.", "This paper describes the lateral resolution enhancement of dynamic spectroscopic imaging ellipsometer, aiming to improve its inspection capabilities. Traditional imaging ellipsometers use a rotating optical elements type scheme which typically requires longer acquisition time. Moreover, for spectroscopic applications, an extra spectral scanning mechanism is needed. The proposed system based on a one-piece polarizing interferometric module, can efficiently extract spatio-spectral ellipsometric phase maps of two-dimensional (2D) materials with a spatial resolution of a few microns at a speed of hundreds of Hz.", "The thickness of the chalcogenide ovonic threshold switching (OTS) layer is one of the most critical parameters for the switch-only memory (SOM) process control. Traditionally, the OTS thickness and composition were measured by XRF using the amounts of Ge, As, and Se. Still, XRF has a few limitations in delivering the required performance, especially for products with multilayer memory architecture. For these products, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) signals overlap and cannot be used to measure the thickness of each layer. In the current paper, we have studied three new alternative approaches for measurements of the OTS thickness on-cell: Spectral Interferometry, Raman spectroscopy, and Hybrid Machine Learning technique. The first method, Spectral interferometry with the Vertical Traveling Scatterometry approach (VTS), allowed OCD modeling of the top of the structure by blocking the complex underlayers and measuring only the top OTS thickness on all targets, including within the chip. The second method, Raman spectroscopy, demonstrated oncell dimensional capabilities with an excellent correlation of the Ge-Se, As-Se, and Ge-Ge bonds of Raman active chalcogenide to TEM OTS thickness values. Finally, the third method used Raman parameters calibrated with TEM as a reference thickness for the ML solution using the VTS spectra on-cell. This ML method is fast, model-free, and requires minimal TEM samples for setup. All three methods have demonstrated capability for on-cell measurements and HVM process control.", "Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy offers inline solutions for chemical bonding, epi thickness, and trench depth measurements. Through optical modeling of the transmission or reflectance spectra, information about the electronic structure and chemical composition may be obtained, which can be used for process control and monitoring. In this article, we demonstrate the measurement capabilities of FTIR for the hydrogen bonding in cell silicon nitride and amorphous carbon hard masks (ACHM), which are used for 3D NAND fabrication. For cell silicon nitride, deconvolution of the spectra allows differentiation between individual peaks corresponding to Si-N, Si-H, N-H, Si-O, and Si-OH bonds. This differentiation identifies wafers with varying hydrogen content and distinct processes. Similarly, for ACHM, peak areas related to sp2 C-H bonds and aromatic C=C bending reveals the hydrogen skew conditions in three wafers. Notably, a linear relationship between high broadband absorption and low C-H bonds (and aromatic C=C) peak area is observed. The measurements exhibit good repeatability across ultrathin silicon nitride and thick ACHM samples. We believe the technique can be valuable for compositional process control, considering the significance of hydrogen content in cell nitride performance and endurance, as well as the influence of hydrogen content and carbon sp2/sp3 ratio on selective etch ratios in dry etch processes involving ACHM and mechanical properties of the films.", "The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 called for NIST to \u201ccarry out a microelectronics research program to enable advances and breakthroughs\u2026.that will accelerate the underlying R&D for metrology of next-generation microelectronics and ensure the competitiveness and leadership of the United States\u2026.\u201d, NIST is leveraging its measurement science expertise, standards development contributions, and stakeholder engagement practices to address the highest priority metrology challenges identified across industry, academia, and government agencies. The program expands upon NIST\u2019s strong track record of supporting the semiconductor technology and manufacturing ecosystem by developing, advancing, and deploying measurement technologies that are accurate, precise, and fit-for-purpose.", "Subsurface Scanning Probe Microscopy (SSPM) complements present optical and electron-beam based techniques (e.g. CD-SEM, x-ray scatterometry, etc.) for measuring through optically opaque layers (for e.g. metals like Ta, W, Ti) by being non-destructive in nature with greater depth sensitivity. With the potential CMOS scaling road-map extension by IMEC presenting Gate All Around (GAA) and Complementary Field Effect Transistors (CFET) as the future of most CMOS devices, there is a rise in stacked 3D architectures with relatively less stiffness difference between adjacent nanostructures. The processing of gate all-around Si transistors requires isolating vertically stacked nanometers-thick Si sheets or wires. For this purpose, the SiGe layers of a SiGe/Si superlattice are etched selectively and laterally. Controlling the quantity of etched SiGe material, i.e., the cavity depth, is critical for optimal device performance. The critical dimension (CD) of the underetch can only be measured by cross-sectional electron microscopy providing limited statistics and hence control of the underetch across wafers. This process also requires more time reducing the overall efficiency. With SSPM, one can sensitively distinguish such cavity structures based on the relative stiffness difference. This process is comparatively faster providing sub nanometers resolution with statistically significant direct local 3D information. This work showcases the enhanced achievable sensitivity in mixed-frequency excitation scheme in comparison to single-frequency excitation scheme in SSPM for distinguishing the critical dimensions of the given samples based on the increasing etch recess. The achieved performance is for distinguishing non-destructively the difference in sub 10nm etch difference lying below a capping layer of approximately 100nm of hard and opaque layer. The top layer can be treated like a gate material due to relatively similar material and physical characteristics. Thus, this work can be treated as an example of subsurface measurements of buried nanostructures through gate like material.", "Advanced semiconductor devices are moving toward 3D geometries due to scaling demands and performance requirements. The non-destructive metrology necessary for process control for high volume manufacturing of 3D structures must be advanced to facilitate their transition from technology development to high volume manufacturing. Optical Critical Dimensions (OCD) techniques based on Mueller Matrix Scatterometry (MMSE) as well as XxRay Diffraction (XRD) have proved capable of measuring the Si/Si1-xGex few layer superlattices used to fabricate Gate All Around (GAA) transistor device test structures. The limitations of these techniques associated with superlattice device structures needed to be further understood. To understand the limits of MMSE Scatterometry and XRD, a four superlattice layer Si/Si1-xGex structure was measured as a film stack, a column etched sample, and at two levels of cavity etch. XRD was used to determine individual layer thicknesses and compositions of the film stack, and electron microscope data was used to verify initial structure dimensions for OCD models. First, film stack characterization and metrology for both ellipsometry and x-ray characterization were explored. OCD modeling and measurement strategies were evaluated to address the challenge of fitting the superlattice thicknesses in the stack at different etch levels. We demonstrate the characterization of relevant test structure dimensions, including cavity etch using MMSE-Scatterometry. We also demonstrate an alternate technique, x-ray fluorescence for determining cavity etch on the same structures.", "The semiconductor industry has witnessed a fast progression of spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) techniques aimed at resolving a plethora of complex device characterizations on a nanometric scale. The Mueller Matrix (MM) methodology coupled with rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) has offered an unprecedented power of investigation and analysis of diverse critical dimensions (CDs), especially when applied to gate-all-around (GAA) structures, as it helps increase the useful spectral signals of the often geometrically buried CDs. However, the sensitivity to the CDs can be often screened by other parameters, hampering the precision and accuracy of the measurement. Combining the most sensitive MM elements has therefore become a critical step of scatterometry critical dimension (SCD) metrology. Driven by the rapid developments of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, we propose a versatile ellipsometry methodology that overcomes poor sensitivity and increases accuracy through a novel principal component analysis (PCA) method of the ML training algorithm with RCWA assistance. Furthermore, our methodology introduces a new ML training concept based on reference data statistics, rather than raw reference. Our approach has been validated with reference data and proved successful in monitoring GAA sheet-specific indent. The proposed methodology paves the way to measuring low sensitivity CDs with highly accurate, noise-reduced and robust ML-based physical SCD models for any logic and memory application.", "CD variation and more specifically, the line edge roughness (LER), on features now dominates the edge placement error (EPE) and can even exceed the overlay error component of EPE as we scale to more advanced process nodes. A method to accurately differentiate between patterning options is required at these dimensions. The measurements must be accurate and not be influenced by the measurement technique or equipment. EUV lithography and the scaling of the dimensions has brought a greater importance to the effects of linewidth roughness (LWR) in device performance. Lithographers today have to spend considerable amounts of time to measure these irregularities coming from stochastic effects as well as chemical reactions, in order to accurately quantify the patterning effects whilst maintaining cost-effectiveness in manufacturing. In this paper we examine usage of unbiased LWR measurements for EUV direct-print patterning of 32nm, 36nm and 72nm pitch gratings to help instruct the proper choice of materials for photolithography, etch process optimization, illumination source selection as well as improved matching of scanner equipment.", "Edge Placement Error (EPE) is a construction metric which can be derived from CD (critical dimension), Overlay and LER (Line Edge Roughness) measurements from multiple layers, and is well accepted as a critical metric of patterning control due to the increases of process complexity as the design rule shrinkage of CMOS devices. Historically, these conventional metrics are measured from multiple tools on different patterns and locations; for example \u2013 overlay, on an optical tool from scribe-line target at ADI (After Develop Inspection) step, while CD/LER data are measured using a CD-SEM tool on a real device pattern at ADI/ACI (After Clean Inspection) steps. TMU (Total Measurement Uncertainty) increasement, which causes the consistency of EPE analysis, is the major limiting factor with the constructive EPE approach. Hence implementing EPE with the constructive way as in-line monitoring metric is not practical and straightforward way. This limitation on traditional EPE methodology can be overcome through single image-based approach, where EPE is measured directly from the high landing energy see-through image. Another advantage is that in parallel it provides CD, Overlay and local variability measured at once on a real device feature. All-In-One (AIO) means all EPE related metrics (CD, Overlay, LER, EPE metric) are captured with single image, which is inherently delivering TMU of sub nm level. Continuous device scaling requires tighter TMU in patterning process integration and control. Fabrication of complex structures demands extremely precise overlay and critical dimension measurement along the sequential processes which drives to a holistic approach on EPE metrology, which can be enabled by new 3D see-trough measurement where traditionally 2D metrics are given. Thanks to the high-resolution see-through image under high keV e-beam, interlayer 3D-EPE measurements on complex geometries can be precisely captured and analyzed. See-through image at ADI step is enabled with recent developments on higher keV e-beam system. Overlay metrology on real pattern at ADI was demonstrated and shown the overlay NZO (Non-Zero Offset) error decomposition between lithography and other processes. For the ADI EPE analysis, the contour extraction from low contrast image is another key enabler together with design-based metrology. Utilizing ADI and ACI AIO image of high landing energy SEM and the contour metrology, EPE metrics can be measured along the process steps and analyzed through contours to design intent. An illustration of such type of measurements is shown in Figure 1. In this paper, we will first demonstrate EPE analysis using AIO image both ADI and ACI step and, second, show how the potential weak patterns with the consideration of 3D-EPE can be measured and extracted through the combination of the AIO see-through imaging of ADI and ACI and the design-based contour metrology. In the long run, 3D-EPE aware weak patterns needs to be qualified as HVM (High Volume Manufacturing) in-line monitoring EPE metric like the traditional CD and Overlay metrology. These design-based 3D-EPE capability of HVM can be expanded and enhanced with the big data nature in production and the new metrology can be potentially improved with the machine learning based technology.", "The grouping method assisted EPE-aware control method is being explored in a multi-feature dual layer Logic use case. EPE metric is estimated using angle resolved optical Scatterometry based overlay and electron beam-based metrology (large field of view SEM) for the reconstruction of edge-to-edge distance between the Metal and Via pattern. In the setup phase, EPE sensitivities to dose and focus have been derived using data from a FEM wafer. EPE-aware optimization, using scanner dose and overlay control sub-recipes, outperforms traditional optimization in simulations showing reduced EPE max per die. This improvement suggests a potential increase in device yield through the adoption of EPE-aware control strategies. To verify this performance improvement on wafers, an experiment is needed with minimal wafer to wafer and lot to lot variations which can be achieved by reducing time between lots and increasing the number of wafers measured.", "The Edge Placement Error (EPE) is growing concerns due to the complexity increases of process variation as the design rule shrinkage of DRAM device. The EPE is a well-accepted metric which can be derived from CD, Overlay and LER measurements from more than patterning layers that concerned. Therefore, real time EPE measurement becomes a major factor to monitor and control the pattern fidelity. The pattern fidelity could be found from the edge placement measurement as a distance to design intent as possible without pattern defects. However, the traditional application of photolithography and etch biases according to a design rule or model for identifying pattern fidelity has inherent low TMU, multiple non consistence data sources and time-consuming off-line analysis. In previous works, we demonstrated the innovative e-Beam EPE metrology application using All-In-One (AIO) methodology to comply the required Total Measurement Uncertainty (TMU) and Time to Result (TTR) on the advanced DRAM nodes. AIO imaging and analysis methodology that deconvolute CD, overlay and relevant EPE metrics from a single see-through image is the most important differentiation for this EPE analysis approach. The in-cell direct EPE measurement with All-In-One (AIO) imaging and massive sampling demonstrates the better process controls and monitoring from the co-optimization of multiple control parameters and direct measurement of the yield relevant metrics. In this paper, we would like to show a couple of EPE monitoring use cases which shows good correlation to the final yield map through the massive and multi-layer measurements. Especially, it is expected that the EPE component which measures the edge-to-edge distance between different features of multi-layers can be a useful indicator for predicting yield along with CD and overlay. To investigate the local and random variabilities, which local stochastic effects are contained, we also studied the degree of yield prediction of the EPE component with increasing number of measurement sites in local area. It is proposed that using a large amount of measurement sites allows to improve the yield prediction accuracy to a certain extent, which means the local stochastic effects can be effectively analyzed with the use of massive metrology approach. In addition, from the prediction accuracy study using EPE model-based machine learning, we proved that the EPE is sufficiently sensitive indicator to capture potential yield-loss problems in normal wafer, as well. Therefore, in-line EPE monitoring using AIO metrology enables the root-cause analysis of patterning weak points and provides a better process monitoring/correction solution to enable faster advanced DRAM node development ramp and high-volume stability.", "As semiconductor device structures continue to shrink and increase its complexity, the need for precise measurement techniques extends beyond single-layer patterning to encompass overlay and Edge Placement Error (EPE) across multiple layers. Traditionally, overlay and EPE have been managed using dedicated patterns and equipment, respectively. However, as manufacturing processes become more intricate, there arises a necessity to measure these parameters directly on actual device patterns. Addressing this demand, High Voltage-Scanning Electron Microscopy (HV-SEM) emerges as a viable tool for on-device-overlay measurement. Nevertheless, challenges persist in achieving accurate measurements using seethrough Backscattered Electron (BSE) imaging due to low contrast and sharpness resulting from electron diffusion through upper-layer patterns. This impedes precise contour extraction and reduces pattern measurement sensitivity. Moreover, in layouts where pattern contours between layers are closely spaced, precise contour extraction becomes even more challenging. To address these issues, a specialized contour extraction function is essential for achieving precise and stable pattern extraction from BSE images. In this paper, we propose a novel HV-SEM overlay measurement methodology utilizing active contour model with Electron Beam (EB) simulation. Synthetic images, designed to emulate the latest device structures and based on BSE features obtained through EB simulation, were employed for evaluation. The results demonstrate the method's robustness to noise and its ability to accurately extract the contours of partially hidden lowerlayer patterns. The proposed approach will enhance the accuracy of HV-SEM overlay measurements, thereby expanding the utility of HV-SEM see-through BSE imaging in semiconductor manufacturing processes.", "This paper characterizes, studies and breaks down different components of OL inaccuracy and NZO for a back-end-of-line (BEOL) metal layer on an advanced node testsite. In this study, NZO is characterized by measuring SEM OL and OM OL at the same locations across the wafer and at various process steps. To understand the root-cause of the NZO, process-induced OL shift on both SEM OL and OM OL from ADI, to AEI and finally to CMP are characterized and discussed. It shows that process-induced OL shift is a major contributor to OL inaccuracy and NZO and is affected by the CD and pitch of the measured feature. This paper also studies OL difference between kerf (where OM OL marks are typically located) and in-die (where actual device are located) overlay. Lastly, OL delta between the two OL measurement techniques was studied by measuring the same OL mark with both SEM OL and OM OL tools. This paper concludes with a breakdown of key contributors to OL inaccuracy and NZO. It provides recommendations and future work on utilizing SEM OL in conjunction with OM OL to address the challenging overlay inaccuracy and NZO requirement for advanced logic node.", "Wafer bonding technology is one of the key processes for high density and high performance semiconductor devices. However, bonding pads could not be directly observed with visible light after wafer bonding because of the thick silicon substrate. In this paper, we demonstrated high-precision bonding overlay control techniques using a bonding machine, an advanced process control (APC) system, and a newly developed overlay measurement tool that uses infrared (IR) light. The accuracy of the IR-light overlay measurement was verified by using a conventional visible-light tool after back-side silicon removal. The verification results showed good measurement repeatability and accuracy of the IR-light measurement which can be performed right after wafer bonding.", "With the increasing complexity of 3-D semiconductor structures, the use of optical critical dimension (OCD) metrology has become a popular solution due to its accuracy and fast inference time. Machine learning has been widely adopted in this field to further improve the efficiency and precision of OCD metrology. Especially for high aspect ratio structures such as DRAM and VNAND, where the required computing power for physical modeling increases exponentially, the importance of machine learning with reference data is crucial. However, one significant challenge of the machine learning-based metrology under rapidly changing process condition is the limitation of available labeled data, which causes overfitting and decreases recipe reliability in the manufacturing process as the cost of wafer consumption increases. To utilize machine learning algorithms in mass production, the development of robust algorithms that can be optimized with few-shot data is required. In this paper, we propose a few-shot machine learning algorithm that includes i) wafer-level statistical information-based data augmentation and ii) anomaly detection to automatically remove data with measurement errors. The proposed algorithm shows superior accuracy, repeatability, and in-wafer uniformity compared to the benchmark algorithm in tests with manufacturing phase data. Additionally, this robustness can be sustained with the minimum amount of data in metrology, as only 9 reference training data are used on three design of experiment (DoE) wafers. The proposed optimized solution is expected to contribute to the reduction of measurement costs and production yields of highly complicated 3D semiconductor structures.", "Continuous progression of Moore\u2019s law brings new challenges in metrology and defect inspection. As the semiconductor industry embraces High-Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (High-NA EUVL), there is a current industry-wide evaluation of this technology for potential pitch reduction in future nodes. One of the primary hurdles in implementing High-NA EUVL in High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) is its low depth of focus. Consequently, suppliers of resist materials are compelled to opt for thin resist and/or new underlayers/hardmask\u2019s. Experimental combinations of thin resist materials with novel underlayers and hardmask\u2019s seem to pose signal detection challenges due to poor Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). In such a scenario, manual classification of these nano-scale defects faces limitations in terms of required time and workforce, and the robustness and generalizability of outcomes are also questionable. In recent years, vision-based machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as an effective solution for image-based semiconductor defect inspection applications. However, developing a robust ML model across various image resolutions without explicit training remains a challenge for nano-scale defect inspection. The goal of this research is to propose a scale-invariant Automated Defect Classification and Detection (ADCD) framework capable to upscale images, addressing this issue. We propose an improvised ADCD framework as SEMI-SuperYOLO-NAS, which builds upon the baseline YOLO-NAS architecture. This framework integrates a Super-Resolution (SR) assisted branch to aid in learning high-resolution (HR) features by the defect detection backbone, particularly for detecting nano-scale defect instances from low-resolution (LR) images. Additionally, the SR-assisted branch can recursively generate or reconstruct upscaled images (\u223c \u00d72/\u00d74/\u00d78...) from their corresponding downscaled counterparts, enabling defect detection inference across various image resolutions without requiring explicit training. Moreover, we investigate improved data augmentation strategy aimed at generating diverse and realistic training datasets to enhance model performance. We have evaluated our proposed approach using two original FAB datasets obtained from two distinct processes and captured using two different imaging tools. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot inference for our model on a new, originating from a process condition distinct from the training dataset and possessing different CD/Pitch characteristics. Our experimental validation demonstrates that our proposed ADCD framework aids in increasing the throughput of imaging tools (\u223c \u00d78) for defect inspection by reducing the required image pixel resolutions.", "2D materials hold significant potential for enhancing semiconductor device performance. However, their integration necessitates the establishment of a robust metrology that is both accurate and fast, enabling a comprehensive understanding and precise control of their growth processes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ticks all the boxes to be a promising technique for 2D materials characterization due to its sensitivity to monolayers (ML) and its high measurement throughput. Nevertheless, automating its measurement analysis is essential to avoid slow data processing and inaccuracies in results. In this work, I propose a set of image-processing algorithms to extract various 2D material properties from SEM images and reveal hidden aspects of their growth processes. Firstly, I implemented and benchmarked two competing segmentation algorithms to process raw SEM images and localize surface regions corresponding to the substrate, 1ML, and 2ML. The first algorithm employs a statistical approach, named global thresholding, while the second is based on supervised machine Learning. These two algorithms were evaluated on a batch of wafers where tungsten disulfide (WS2) material was grown, reaching a maximum of 2ML. The machine learning algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving segmentation success rates that surpassed 98%, outperforming the global thresholding technique, which has a success rate of 86.5%. Subsequently, other algorithms were developed to extract quality indicators of 2D material layers from the segmented images, such as the coverage rate, and the count of basic crystals and islands. Reviewing all extracted properties enabled us to assess the process uniformity on wafers across different facets. On the other hand, the cross-analysis of these features unveiled some fundamental properties of the studied growth process. We determined the 1ML coverage at which crystals transition from a quasi-isolated growth to the coalescence phase, as well as when the formation of a uniform 1ML begins. Finally, we deduced the important relationship between the growth rates of 1ML and 2ML.", "As the semiconductor structures become increasingly miniaturized and complex, the process of measuring and analyzing the structure using a microscope becomes crucial. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) images are widely used, but they are expensive to acquire and analyze. If the region and boundary of the material in the TEM image can be automatically segmented, the measurement cost will be reduced. We proposed a method to generate a segmentation label for a TEM image using a deep learning model that performs segmentation based on weak supervision and active learning. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 98% in 10% of the time compared to the manual method. This approach will reduce the cost of high-resolution TEM image analysis and accelerate the semiconductor device development process.", "Next-generation space telescopes under development by NASA will require high efficiency and resolving power soft x-ray spectrometers which can provide an order of magnitude increased performance compared to present space instrumentation. For the past decade the MIT Space Nanotechnology Lab has developed new x-ray spectrometer concepts based on so-called critical-angle transmission (CAT) gratings which exploit the principle of efficient x-ray reflection below the critical angle for total external reflection. These devices require challenging high-aspect ratio (HAR) \u201cnano mirror\u201d grating patterns with well controlled bar tilt angle and sub-nm surface smoothness. Gratings are patterned with precision (110) SOI wafers using 193 nm lithography and etched using a Bosch process. In this paper we present the first results of applying Mueller Matrix OCD mapping to our silicon HAR device geometry and compare with small angle x-ray scattering results.", "The paradigm shift to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for circuits with sub-10 nm nodes brought about ultrahigh-precision optics and masks in reflective optical paths, creating challenges in the fabrication and metrology of the elements. The reflective optics and masks and ultrafine reticles on wafers offer the impetus of new complimentary CD metrology techniques that offer high-resolution dimensional probes in reflection geometry. In this work, we developed reflective hard X-ray holography imaging as the next-generation metrology tool for EUVL wafers/optics and wafers, without any sample modifications (milling and thinning). We demonstrate the capability of a new surface-reflection-based X-ray holography method for determining 3D dimensions of planar surface patterns supported by simple (but thick) substrates with nanometer resolutions. We anticipate that the holographic imaging technique will immediately benefit the nondestructive CD metrology of EUV reflective optics, masks, and reticles on wafers.", "As the manufacturing process is more integrated, in the field of metrology, there is an increasing demand for method to monitor local dispersion of measurement value that can trace randomly generated week points in the chip. Since it is difficult to obtain local dispersion with an optical method where the relatively large spot compared to the size of the target structure, many attempts have been made to use other method such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is clear that SEM is suitable for obtaining local dispersion thanks to its high resolution, but it is difficult to obtain thickness information because only contrast data is included in the image. From these demands, a method using gray level (GL) index of the SEM image to estimate the depth of the target pattern has been proposed. However, because it is an index that simply correlates the GL value to the depth without considering pattern geometry, it follows different trends depending on the design rule and dispersion of the critical dimension (CD) and depth. In order to overcome this inhomogeneity of the GL index, in this study, we propose 3D GL index considering the field of view (FOV) of secondary electron (SE) emission according to the 3D geometry of the pattern. We apply effective FOV derived from SE emission function estimated by Lambertian distribution and CD and depth of the pattern to conventional GL index. As a result of applying it to the polysilicon hole pattern and comparing it with the vertical-SEM depth measurement, unlike the existing index, 3D GL index shows a clear linear trend with high correlation R2 of 0.781 regardless of design rule and dimension variation. In that it can more accurately and robustly respond to process variation, the proposed 3D GL index can increase the utilization of the depth monitoring method using SEM image.", "The accurate measurement of the thickness profile, particularly in the presence of non-uniform thin films deposited on substrates with warpage, is a crucial aspect of various applications spatially, in the overlay process of the semiconductor industry. The conventional method of Fizeau interferometer-based shape and geometry measurement has limitations in nanometer-level accurate volumetric profile measurement when non-uniform and complex thin films are deposited upon a warped Si substrate. Spectroscopic ellipsometry can be the best candidate for ultra-thin film volumetric thickness profile metrology rather than spectral reflectometry. But current spectral ellipsometry is time consuming. To address these challenges, our research group has made significant advancements in the field of spectroscopic imaging ellipsometry by developing dynamic spectroscopic imaging ellipsometry (DSIE). In this study, we describe a dynamic ultra-thin film thickness line-profile measurement method by adding a Mach-Zehnder interferometer module to a dynamic spectroscopic imaging ellipsometer. The proposed system can provide nanometer-level ultra-thin film thickness line-profile and the warped surface profile information of a Si substrate simultaneously.", "We present recent experiments conducted with our tabletop EUV reflectometer to characterize the detailed geometry, composition, and topography of several nanostructured, polymer-based samples. The EUV measurements are performed without sample damage or any significant sample preparation. Correlative STEM measurements confirm the EUV results, but require extensive sample preparation.", "As scaling in semiconductor devices continues, the aspect ratios of deep trench isolation (DTI) structures have increased. DTI structures are used in power devices, power management ICs and image sensors as a method to isolate active devices by reducing crosstalk, parasitic capacitance, latch-up and allowing for an increase breakdown voltage of active devices. Measurement of these structures in high volume manufacturing (HVM), with non-destructive technology, has mostly been limited to the depth and top width of the DTI structure, while the bottom width (BCD) has not been able to be reliably measured. Here we present two different optical metrologies, \u201cconventional\u201d OCD and IRCD, that operate in the UV-VIS-NIR and MIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum, respectively, and discuss the measurability of DTI sidewall profile, bottom width, and depth in BCD (Bipolar CMOS DMOS) power management IC devices for each method at various pitches and line to space ratios. Experimental data will be presented showing sensitivity and discrimination of IRCD to a DOE specifically on the bottom width for three different structures.", "For many years, e-beam SEM metrology has been quite conservative. However, a few years ago, we began to observe a sort of restlessness in the field, a trend that was consistently confirmed year after year since then. Such a change was mainly driven by the daunting specification requirements for the advanced metrology nodes and High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (High NA EUVL), as well as by the device evolution in terms of architecture. We observed a systematic attempt to expand the application space in which the e-beam SEM had operated, tackling issues ranging from metrology of 3D structures to edge placement error, voltage contrast, e-beam inspection, and more. Such an expansion of the application space has forced heavily automated SEM to evolve into something different: a more flexible and powerful e-beam tool focusing not only on CD metrology, but on a range of novel use cases. To implement these new applications, it soon became evident that it was necessary to expand the range and type of tool specifications and features. We observed changes in landing energy, beam current, resolution, as well as algorithms. The detection process changed too, and higher current and better detection efficiency opened the door to a variety of back-scattered electron applications. Artificial intelligence is now critical not only in terms of speed of analysis, but most importantly for the quality of its results. Multibeam tools are fast approaching and have the potential to become a central technology element in the high-NA EUVL environment, where resolution and throughput for inspection must go hand-in-hand. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent trends in e-beam metrology and inspection.", "OPC (optical proximity correction) is a well-known and widely used RET (resolution enhancement technique) in optical lithography, which main purpose is improving pattern fidelity and process window. OPC relies on CD-SEM (critical dimension scanning electron microscope) images as a source of information for EPE (edge placement error) measurement, as input for the OPC modeling flow. However, as the pitch scales, stricter OPC modeling specifications, reduced metrology error budget, and increasing pattern complexities, create challenges for traditional CD-SEM metrology. Also, parameters like materials, landing energy and other scanning conditions, may have a different impact in the final image in terms of shrinkage, charging and distortion. All these effects need to be characterized during the modeling step to optimize OPC. Examples of EPE uniformity and pattern shrinkage are illustrated in Figure 1, for different scan conditions. With the increasing adoption of EUV (extreme ultraviolet) technology in the field of patterning and the upcoming introduction of High-NA (high numerical aperture) EUV, the need for further understanding of the EUV resist material interaction with a CD-SEM electron beam is also increasing. Low landing energy scanning approach is a way to minimize EUV resist damage during image acquisition and provide a more accurate view of EUV lithography effects. Also, to improve the design space coverage, resist (or lithographic) and etch modeling require thousands of measurements over different types of structures. Additionally, massive EPE statistics makes model building more robust. A contour may provide the equivalent of hundreds of different measurements \u2013 using the entirety of the contour instead of only relying on the placement of gauges, as in conventional measurement, further increases the sampling and the coverage of the produced model, which make contours the suitable choice. The influence of low landing energy is expected to be seen in the etch modeling step, where it should have higher accuracy and lower etch bias when compared to litho SEM data. However, a drawback of using low landing energy for image acquisition is a lower SNR (Signal-to-Noise ratio) compared to standard imaging conditions. This may represent extra challenges to the contour extraction algorithm which needs to be robust. These challenges can be addressed by using a model-based approach. In this work, different CD-SEM scanning conditions were studied in order to find optimal working points for modeling purposes. Since different patterns have varied outcomes under different e-beam conditions, thus affecting the model residues, more than 600 distinct patterns from EUV lithography \u2013 going from 1D to complex 2D \u2013 were selected to provide enough sensitivity to when building the litho and the etch models. Contour metrology is used to detect the edges, for EPE analysis, and to provide inputs for the modeling flow. At last, one of the key aspects of this work is the use of low landing energy (150eV) scan approach to minimize the resist shrinkage effect, while accounting for resist charging in the modeling. All these factors will provide further insight and optimization into this new era of metrology.", "The adoption of EUV technology in DRAM fabrication is primarily driven by the pursuit of higher device densities, improved performance, and increased energy efficiency. EUV's shorter wavelength (13.5 nm) enables enhanced resolution and finer patterning, enabling the production of smaller memory cells with reduced feature sizes. As the target patterning size is becoming sub-10nm, line edge/width roughness (LER/LWR) is the centerpiece in controlling uniformity of pattern going through the lithography process. Accordingly, it is essential to figure out the dedicated CDSEM metrology method for EUV step without any image quality degradation, charging issue, and e-beam damage that can hinder accurate diagnosis of the real process status. Empirically, it is highly difficult to predict the best metrology condition that fits to the specific resist material, dimension, and geometry due to complex stochastic effect caused by secondary electron inside photoresist (PR) material. Here we represent experimental results of PR damage caused by electron beam irradiation with different landing energy for both line and space (LS) pattern and contact hole (CH) pattern. The results enabled us to define the effect of the landing energy and geometry of pattern on the critical dimension (CD) and roughness. We examined electron irradiation induced damage by comparing etch bias of fresh location and e-beam exposed location on etch process step to fully understand shrinkage and deformation behavior. For the roughness measurement of CH pattern, we adopted new metric which enables us to quantify contact edge roughness and shape of contact. Utilizing various metrics, it was possible to observe damage on the process, which was not observed only by CD changes, and it was confirmed that the primary beam with low landing energy could be used to not only reduce damage but also enhance surface sensitivity of metrology without bias which is crucial for stochastic effect monitoring on the EUV process.", "In device overlay is an important contributor to the on-product overlay budget. Well known are overlay bias effects, i.e., differences between overlay targets and in-product features. These can be corrected by a non-zero overlay correction in the run-to-run system. In this paper, we examine micro-scale effects, which happen on scales of a few micrometers, for which there is not exposure tool correction possible. With a high-voltage SEM, we use a novel method to investigate both logic and memory wafers and identify several micro-scale effects that are a significant contributor to the on-product overlay budget. We characterize the behavior across the wafer and local variations. In the root cause analysis, we find several possible explanations including mask writer issues, local stress, and impact of the product pitch.", "Technology nodes shrink leads to a very tight process control window. As an inline metrology tool, CD-SEM (Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope) matching error for the entire fleet should be less than 10% of the process control window. The tight matching is also obligated to be coupled with HVM (High-Volume Manufacturing) requirements of high tool availability and fast recipe creation. To meet these challenging restrictions, iterative improvements on existing methodologies are no longer sufficient and a complimentary approach needs to be adopted. The operation of any fab tool, and specifically CD-SEM holds an enormous amount of information. The tool\u2019s various modules parameters such as: currents and voltages and environmental status (temperature, noise etc.), the working point and beam parameters: scan rate, beam current, pixel size, landing energy, beam shape and size, etc., and the specific wafer characteristics: materials, pattern, charging effects etc. Encapsulating all these together contributes to the final matching error sensitivity. As we are moving towards a data-driven era, this information can be utilized to better predict, correct, and improve matching (i.e., by neural network, machine learning etc.). Furthermore, today\u2019s matching metrics, which are based on 1-D CD measurements from SEM images (a convolution of the final SEM image and algorithm), are indirect and are not sufficient for understanding the whole story. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that combines iterative improvements with data-driven methodologies that can enable a matching level suitable for EUV requirements in the \u00c5 era.", "Background: Process window metrology is used in manufacturing to determine best dose and focus for the scanner, but current metrology uses defect inspection to determine best focus and thus is expensive and time consuming. Aim: Ideally, an alternate stochastics metric (such as linewidth roughness for line/space patterns) could be used as a substitute for defectivity measurements, saving time and money. Approach: Here, the Probabilistic Process Window (PPW) is evaluated as an improved alternative to the plan of record approach, where only CD-SEM images are collected and evaluated. Results: The PPW was found to provide results that matched to the plan of record approach, but with increased rigor and improved precision. Conclusions: As a result, critical layers on future DRAM manufacturing nodes will use the PPW for best dose/focus scanner control.", "We have developed a high-resolution x-ray microscope with spatial resolution better than 100 nm. The utilized x-ray energy of the microscope is 17.5 keV that can penetrate through standard silicon substrate and enables to observe embedded nanoscale metal structure and defects, nondestructively. We have applied the present x-ray microscope for investigating 3D flash memory devices and observed precise metal filling structure in there. In addition, defects in the circuit area were also found.", "In the manufacturing of CMOS devices, the golden standard for determining yield at various stages of production is electrical testing. This allows for the identification of failing devices or early yield failures before proceeding to subsequent steps. However, the failure of electrical tests can occur due to various reasons inherent to the structures of the devices. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis is necessary to ascertain the root cause of the failure mechanism once a device does not pass the electrical tests.", "On-product overlay (OPO) is a critical inline process control parameter in semiconductor manufacturing. One of the main factors that induce the overlay error is non-lithography processes like etching, deposition and cleaning. The overlay margin is getting tighter as the device technology advances and detecting the root cause of process-induced overlay error is a main problem to improving the OPO. However, it is not an easy problem to solve due to the lack of inline monitoring data on non-lithography processes. Even if we evaluate inline monitoring data, it is too sparse to do in-depth analysis compared to abundant lithographic overlay data. Instead, we can make use of data from the PWG patterned wafer geometry metrology system, which can measure high-density data with high throughput. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive method of detecting the root cause of the process-induced overlay errors based on inline PWG data. Our target device is a 3D NAND product with process-induced overlay errors due to wafer geometry. We start our analysis by tracing PWG GEN3 data for the same wafer in a wide process step range. We compare the GEN3 signature to an overlay error signature of a target lithography layer to filter out suspicious processes. From the suspicious processes, we derived optimized KPIs that discriminate between good and bad wafers in terms of process-induced overlay errors, which are then used as a monitoring metric. With the optimized KPIs, we discern which process is the root cause of process-induced overlay errors to help drive corrective actions and improve OPO on the target device. Finally, we propose a comprehensive framework that is not limited to PWG data but applies to other available inline data such as alignment, ADI and AEI overlay and NZO.", "As semiconductor process technology needs to be advanced, the difficulty of patterning increases and unexpected pattern defects occur. In fact, it is very important to quickly identify and resolve these pattern defects in advance, but there is a limit to measuring all of these pattern defects that occur in wafers. In particular, in order to overcome metrological limitations, it may be best to extract actual potential pattern defects by classifying various types of patterns that actually exist. We measured how to classify weak patterns by sampling them based on previously known weak pattern group libraries, simulation-based weak patterns, and unique patterns. Through this method, engineers can subjectively judge how to find weak patterns, and it can be difficult because there is a possibility that the probability of weak patterns is low depending on the limited measurement capacity. In this paper, unsupervised learning is used to cluster and classify by pattern type based on the various features of pattern. Then, based on reliable wafer data for various classified pattern types, the degree of vulnerability to defect was quantified for each classified cluster to give a ranking for extracting a weak pattern group for each cluster, and the weak pattern was extracted based on this to confirm a high weak pattern detection rate. In addition, it provides effective solutions to extract weak patterns from various databases (DBs) and specifically to give reliability to visualization methods.", "Si/SiGe heterostructures are gaining traction as a starting template in applications such as Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor (GAAFET), complementary FET (CFET), and 3-dimensional dynamic random access memory (3D-DRAM), where the SiGe alloy plays the role of sacrificial material for channel release. However, the formation of crystalline defects (e.g. crosshatch) in the epitaxially grown layers plays a critical part in determining the overall device performance. As such, it is key to be able to control the defectivity level using large surface area inspection techniques. The challenge of such inspection is that it must combine a high enough throughput to detect low-density defects together with sensitivity to nanometer size defects. In addition, the technique should also be able to distinguish these elongated one-dimensional crystalline defects from other types of defects. In this study, we investigate the impact of the number of Si/SiGe bilayers on the crystal defect distribution utilizing a combined approach of optical inspection and extensive e-beam review for both qualitative and quantitative defect characterization. In-line optical inspection techniques revealed that the crosshatch density and distribution varied significantly with the number of Si/SiGe bilayers. These observations were then confirmed by high-resolution e-beam review coupled with image analysis and signal processing to enable crosshatch quantification. Our approach considers an initial investigation on thin Si/SiGe bilayers (up to ~5x bilayers) and is further extended to thick stacks (up to 60x bilayers) to evaluate the capability of optical inspection as the high-throughput reference technique. In conclusion, this study aims to develop a methodology to investigate the crosshatch density in Si/SiGe superlattices, using optical inspection and e-beam review as main characterization tools. These techniques offer valuable insights in terms of defect distribution at the wafer level for the design and fabrication of next-generation semiconductor devices.", "Subsurface structures exhibit contrast in the backscattered electron (BSE) signal of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) if they and the surrounding material have different BSE yields and the electrons are energetic enough to make the round trip. Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors have gates formed by multiple subsurface nanowires or nanosheets. I will present Monte Carlo simulated BSE images of a virtual GAA transistor viewed from different angles. Simulations quantify the increase of resolution and decrease of contrast with increasing beam energy. They can inform the choice of operating conditions and the assignment of image features to their corresponding structures.", "As CMOS node advanced, device patterns become smaller and denser, which as a result, decrease overlay budget. Each contributor to overlay error is significant and should be minimized, even at early stage of technology development. The performance of optical overlay metrology is challenged by the difference between optical target and device structure, which response differently to lithography optics (aberration response), hence reduce correlation to device overlay. E-Beam overlay can mitigate this gap as it can measure device-size structures. In this case, the challenge is to measure small, dense and buried patterns, which may have low visibility (contrast and edge resolution), but still provide acceptable total measurement uncertainty (TMU) to reduce error budget from the tight overlay specs. Finding optimal target where its design is similar or close to device and is measurable with robust performance, without designing and re-design targets in multiple tape-out cycles, can be done by simulating scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements of different device-like targets and find the optimal point where predicted performances are good and the design is as close to the device. In this paper we propose a method that evaluates measurement performances of different SEM overlay target designs using e-Beam simulation of back-scatter electrons (BSE) yield from buried layers. Targets with different design rules: pitch, critical dimensions (CD) and edge-to-edge distance are simulated at different measurement conditions and results are compared to measurement of actual targets on wafer. The comparison shows that measurement performance can be predicted by simulation, which can point out optimal target design and measurement conditions.", "Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) technology makes use of an electron beam (e-beam) with wide energy range from 0.1 to 50 keV, so it is possible to measure wafers from surface to deep and buried structures. Due to its superior accuracy, it is widely used for in-line metrology and inspection (MI) process. As devices scaling down for performance enhancement, the MI process became inaccurate due to the target structure shrinkage and complicated electrons\u2019 behavior inside it. To overcome the challenges, accurate simulation tool is required to understand its underlying mechanism theoretically. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework for simulating SEM operation by implementing Nebula e-beam computing algorithm on the Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) environment. The proposed framework integrates various physics models including the scattering and transport behaviors of electrons, which enables to calculate the important trajectories of electrons in the most important regions of wafers. In addition, it gives an expandability on further integration thanks to the computability of TCAD environment. We validate the proposed framework with demonstrating key applications on real products.", "As semiconductor devices continue to introduce new materials and structures, not only the dimensions but the material properties are becoming important in determining the device properties. Properties of insulator films used in transistors and memory devices are of particular interest as they determine the characteristics as well as the reliability of the devices. The material properties can depend not only on their deposition conditions, but also on the processes they are later exposed to, such as annealing and etching. Therefore, the film properties can change over the course of device fabrication. To ensure efficient production of these devices, an inline tool for metrology and inspection of material properties is desirable. One way to evaluate the material properties is to measure the material\u2019s response to application of voltage. For this purpose, we have developed a laser-assisted SEM, an SEM with laser irradiation capability to control the electrical state of the material under SEM observation. The laser is used to inject carriers into insulators to control or neutralize insulator charging caused by the electron beam. Therefore, the combination of an electron beam and laser irradiation can be used to control the sample voltage. The material response can be measured in either the amount or energy of the secondary electron signals. Therefore, how the signal changes depending on the electron beam or the laser condition can be used to indirectly evaluate the material properties of the sample. In this work, we have used the laser-assisted SEM to detect the change in material properties of insulator films under annealing and different etching plasma conditions. The laser-assisted SEM was found to be sensitive not only to bulk film properties, but also to buried interfaces. These new features can make the laser-assisted SEM useful as needs continue to grow for inline metrology and inspection of semiconductor devices.", "Contamination in electron microscopy is a persistent problem. Depending on the kind and amount of precursor molecules, vacuum level, sample material and temperature, and the intensity and energy of the irradiating electrons, deposition can overwhelm removal, or vice versa. Electron irradiation with 100 eV electrons is a new method for achieving ultra-high cleanliness (UHC), so the sample can be irradiated by electrons indefinitely without depositing any perceptible amount of contamination. The simple and effective, high-vacuum cleaning method creates new possibilities in many electron- and ion-based measurements where UHC is needed, but ultra-high vacuum is not necessarily required.", "Advanced packaging enables the heterogeneous integration of different components, to integrate functional devices needed for the ever-diversifying needs of compute market. For advanced packaging to achieve a high level of integration, the package substrate must be densely populated with various components, often in a complex 2.5D or 3D configuration. This requires extremely fine pitch interconnects and high accuracy alignment between different components. System-in-package use multiple lithography steps to print the redistribution layers connecting the chips (RDLs), driving an increasing need in alignment and overlay metrology. Another limitation of conventional reticle driven lithography is that scaling is limited by die placement accuracy and warpage caused by the stacking of multiple chiplets and substrates. To address these limits in productivity and scaling, digital lithography for advanced packaging was introduced, to print the RDLs in the needed rotation to stich the interconnects to the packaged devices. To avoid cracking, delamination and voids, tighter inspection specs are needed. And to achieve high performing integrated system-in-package, new test steps are required to match chiplets in performance way ahead before sort, but the increasing I/O density requires contactless test as conventional probes become too large and cause defects as they perform test. In this talk we will cover the Heterogenous Integration processes that drive the need to form an ecosystems of metrology inspection and test to fuel Moore\u2019s law via high performance system-in-package", "Wafer-to-wafer hybrid bonding is a key technology for achieving high-density three-dimensional interconnections in semiconductor devices. This technology directly bonds Cu pads formed on the surface of two wafers, where the surface height of the Cu pad compared to the SiCN surrounding the Cu pad have to be within a few nm. We have developed a method to measure the Cu pad surface height with sub-nm precision by using a top-view scanning electron microscope image. The proposed method is based on the physical principle that the difference in the backscattered electron (BSE) signals of the opposing detectors is dependent on the slope. It estimates the slope of the target with the BSE signal and then calculates the height of the target on the basis of this slope. We compared the Cu pad height measurement results by this method with those by atomic force microscopy and found that ours provided measurement precision on the sub-nm order and demonstrated the capability for evaluation of layout dependency and intra-wafer distribution. Because of its speed and alignment capability, our proposed method is promising for Cu height control in wafer-to-wafer hybrid bonding.", "Comprehensive through-silicon-via (TSV) characterization, including grind side measurements, is critical to ensure device reliability in chiplet technology. Here we report on TSV metrology using spectral interferometry (SI), which is used to acquire absolute phase information of polarized and broad-band light interacting with a sample. This phase information can be translated into the optical path length of the partial beams traveling within the structure. We utilize the spatial separation of peaks related to light reflected from the top surface and the surface of interest to directly measure the TSV depth after reactive ion etching as well as the reveal height on the grind side, without modeling and even in the presence of multilayers or surrounding patterning. Polarization-dependent SI measurements enable the quantification of asymmetry at the bottom of the TSVs not visible in top-down CD measurements. SI is robust and fast and unveils novel information in TSV metrology not accessible with established in-line metrology techniques.", "In the past few decades, leading edge logic technology scaling has been the main driver for semiconductor metrology developments. As traditional device scaling is slowing down, the semiconductor industry is focusing also on heterogeneous integration approaches, which leverage advanced packaging technologies to integrate devices designed and manufactured separately using the most suitable process technology for each device. Heterogeneous integration presents significant metrology challenges, which are different from what is encountered at the logic device level in terms of materials and specifically dimensions. Large-scale 3D structures need to be characterized with unprecedented accuracies and advanced optical techniques play a pivotal role. In this paper, some metrology challenges in heterogeneous integration are introduced and discussed related to TSV characterization including depth and reveal height, wafer bonding measurements, and dimensional and overlay metrology for processing leading to bump receivers and bump formation. Current capabilities utilizing various imaging and interferometry techniques are presented and their limitations discussed.", "3D heterogeneous integration is an evolving segment in integrated circuit development and advanced packaging to drive More than Moore (MtM) chip scaling. Heterogeneous integration allows IC manufacturers to stack and integrate more silicon devices in a single package, increasing the transistor density and product performance. Product designers seek higher bandwidth, increased power, improved signal integrity, more flexible designs (mix/match different chip functions, sizes, and technology nodes), and lower overall costs. The 3D heterogeneous integration roadmap shows a decrease in the bonding bumps/pads pitch to a sub-micrometer level, enabling a higher bump I/O density. Key process development activity is occurring in the wafer-to-wafer (W2W) bonding process to reduce interconnect pitch to small values. In the W2W process, a wafer bonder is used to align and bond two whole wafers. To successfully unite these two bond surfaces with a very small pitch, tight control of the bond pad alignment is required to ensure the copper pads line up properly before being bonded, driving an increased need for overlay metrology precision and die-bonder control. The bonded wafers are subsequently cut up into stacked chips using a dicing process and then undergo testing and further packaging. Advanced processing control (APC) for W2W hybrid bonding is an important factor in fulfilling the target on-product overlay (OPO) via litho inputs, in-plane distortion (IPD), overlay (OVL) and bonder correction knobs. This work will evaluate the various aspects impacting OPO, including the pre and post-bonding error budget.", "In this work, we study the optical overlay metrology performance and impact of an integrated hard mask etch step using the dry resist process with High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (High NA EUVL)-related thicknesses.

Multiple examples are presented in the paper, including the measurement of the thin and thick layers of memory structures above the complex logic arrays and the remaining thickness of the fully processed Si wafer from the back side after thinning. In addition, VTS and AI enable direct profiling of the deep through-type cell metal contacts in the areas with nonperiodic staircases and significant lateral variations under the measurement spot.", "Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging is widely used in semiconductor manufacturing, including for defect inspection. One use is to identify contact holes that are potentially scummed (not completely cleared to the substrate). However, the visibility of the bottom of a contact hole (and thus the ability to identify scumming) is limited when the aspect ratio of the hole becomes high. In this work, a large designed experiment simulation study using AMAG SimuSEM will thoroughly explore the parametric influences of profile and CD for via bottom detection in the secondary electron regime, including not only aspect ratio, but also influences of sidewall angle and footing, along with defect cases of incomplete etch or resist residues in hole bottoms.

Some processors are already beyond the 100-qubit scale. In order to keep the development cadence of those quantum processors high, the test time per qubit needs to be strongly reduced from days to hours. Here we present a test time study based on extracting a single-qubit fidelity using a randomized benchmarking protocol. We show that more than a dozen other tune-up steps are required before a randomized benchmarking protocol can be executed on a qubit. En bloc, such a structured workflow leads to a test-time of about 20 mins per qubit. By extrapolating, we find that testing single-qubit fidelities on a hecto-qubit scale quantum chip using the randomized benchmarking protocol would take about 2.5 days. Executing the test protocol is furthermore embedded in a total test cycle that takes into account that a chip needs to be inserted, tested, and retrieved from the system, consisting of a cooldown to 20 mK base temperature and afterwards a warmup to ambient conditions.

Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) manufacturing equipment utilizes a patterning technology that involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. The technology faithfully reproduces patterns with a higher resolution and greater uniformity compared to those produced by photolithography equipment. Additionally, as this technology does not require an array of wide-diameter lenses and the expensive light sources necessary for advanced photolithography equipment, NIL equipment achieves a simpler, more compact design, allowing for multiple units to be clustered together for increased productivity. Previous studies have demonstrated NIL resolution better than 10nm, making the technology suitable for the printing of several generations of critical memory levels with a single mask. In addition, resist is applied only where necessary, thereby eliminating material waste. Given that there are no complicated optics in the imprint system, the reduction in the cost of the tool, when combined with simple single level processing and zero waste leads to a cost model that is very compelling for semiconductor memory applications. Memory fabrication is challenging, in particular for DRAM, because the roadmap for DRAM calls for continued scaling, eventually reaching half pitches of 14nm and beyond. For DRAM, overlay on some critical layers is much tighter than NAND Flash, with an error budget of 15 to 20% of the minimum half pitch. For 14nm, this means 2.1 to 2.8nm. DRAM device design is also challenging, and layouts are not always conducive to pitch dividing methods such as SADP and SAQP. This makes a direct printing process, such as NIL, an attractive solution. Logic is more challenging from a defectivity perspective, often requiring defect levels significantly lower than memory devices that incorporate redundancy. To establish a new lithographic production solution requires the support of an ecosystem in order to enable seamless insertion of the technology. In this paper, review the current performance of Canon\u2019s and then move on to discuss a variety of ecosystem technologies including drop pattern generation, NIL process simulation, virtual metrology support and pattern transfer techniques that can be applied to different markets. Finally, we touch on other applications that can be addressed with NIL and show some processing examples.", "Imprint lithography is an effective and well-known technique for replication of nano-scale features.

Given that there are no complicated optics in the imprint system, the reduction in the cost of the tool, when combined with simple single level processing and zero waste leads to a cost model that is very compelling for semiconductor memory applications. Any new lithographic technology to be introduced into manufacturing must deliver either a performance advantage or a cost advantage. Key technical attributes include alignment, overlay and throughput. In previous papers, overlay and throughput results have been reported on test wafers. In 2018, Hiura et al. reported a mix and match overlay (MMO) of 3.4nm and a single machine overlay (SMO) across the wafer was 2.5nm using an FPA-1200 NZ2C four station cluster tool. These results were achieved by combining a magnification actuator system with a High Order Distortion Correction (HODC) system, thereby enabling correction of high order distortion terms up to K30. Unlike other lithographic methods, NIL provides the pattern flexibility and a cost structure to address a much larger application space. Potential market expansion and includes high end semiconductor devices, CMOS image sensors, optical couplers for augmented reality headsets and meta optical elements (MOEs). The purpose of this paper is to describe the patterning and pattern transfer performance enhancements to enable improved edge placement error for DRAM applications, allow the patterning of dual damascene back end structures with a simpler single step imprint patterning process and to create working MOEs operational in the visible spectrum.", "As next-generation packaging substrates, the use of glass materials with low dielectric-loss characteristics is a promising approach. However, producing micro-vias in glass is still challenging because it is a brittle material that is susceptible to breaking. One potential method for fabricating high-quality holes with high aspect ratios is ablation using a high-power KrF excimer laser. In this process, the glass surface is irradiated by a high-fluence laser beam formed using a focusing lens. To produce a small-diameter focused laser beam, a low beam quality factor (M2) of close to unity is required. However, this is generally only possible for an ideal single-mode Gaussian beam. For an excimer laser beam, the M2 value is larger due to the fact that the beam is produced by multi- mode oscillation. In the present study, we used a cylindrical off-axis unstable resonator with a KrF laser and obtained a high-quality beam (M2: V:7.1, H:5.4) with a high output power (58.4 mJ/pulse). With this light source, it is a feasible approach to fabricate fine holes by laser ablation with a diffraction-limited focused diameter of 20\u03bcm when an imaging lens with a focal length of 100mm was used. The laser output power was found to be similar to that for a conventional stable resonator. Gigaphoton demonstrates that a combination of a KrF excimer laser and an unstable resonator provides high-productivity fabrication of fine micro-via holes for the High-performance Advanced packaging.", "A new application in the semiconductor industry that received quite some traction the past few years is bringing the transistor power delivery network to the backside of the wafer. The big gain of this change is that it frees up real estate on the frontside of the wafer, enabling a further increase of the transistor density. This so-called Back-Side Power Delivery Network (BS-PDN) application is quite challenging since it requires a direct wafer-to-wafer bonding process module. To get access to the transistor from the backside, a device wafer needs to be flipped and bonded to a carrier wafer followed by an annealing step. After these processing steps, the original substrate of the device wafer is removed by grinding and etch steps. This will enable access to the transistors from the backside of the wafer. The wafer processing continues by conventional layer deposition, lithography and etch steps, this time on the flipped wafer. Unfortunately, the bonding process module that includes the actual direct wafer-to-wafer bonding step itself, will also introduce a distortion in the device layer that has been transferred to the carrier wafer. Since the on-product overlay requirement for the first exposed layer on the backside to one of the front-side layers is tight (<10-nm today and <<5-nm in the foreseeable future), a deep understanding of the origin of the distortion fingerprint after bonding is required. In our previous work, we presented a method to isolate the distortion fingerprint due to bonding from the remaining other overlay contributors. The fingerprint we observed after linear corrections had a typical magnitude ranging from 50 to 80-nm. A clear 4-fold symmetry was observed that could be attributed to the crystal orientation of the (100) silicon substrate. We demonstrated that the scanner wafer alignment model is very capable of correcting the global 4-fold wafer distortion fingerprint. Residual levels of less than ~15-nm were shown. These residuals could be further reduced by applying a correction per exposure (CPE) recipe. We showed that performance levels of less than ~6-nm (99.7%) and ~10-nm (max) could be achieved after a 33-parameter per exposure field self-correction. The resulting wafer plots nicely revealed how to improve the overlay performance further. An increased level of residuals was found in the wafer center and at the wafer edge. In the current paper, we build upon our previous work and continue the investigation on the remaining overlay contributors that were identified previously. This time, the focus will be on the local wafer deformations that are visible after the direct wafer-to-wafer bonding step. By local we mean the distortions that manifest themselves over a very short spatial range. These local distortions cannot easily be corrected by the scanner and are typically present close to the wafer center and the wafer edge. We know that the local wafer deformation close to the wafer center is caused by the bonding pin that initiates the bond wave. To characterize the center distortion signature, we varied many experimental parameters to see the impact. We will show the impact of the die layout, the rotation of the top wafer by a 45-degrees, wafer surface properties, and substrate choice of the carrier wafer. The latter is interesting, we evaluated both (100) and (111) carrier wafers. Although the prime focus will be to improve the overlay performance on the center of the wafer, we monitor the impact of the experimental settings on the wafer edge and remaining part of the wafer as well. We present a path forward to mitigate the local distortions such that they will not be blocking for high volume production.", "The use of imprint resists in the frame of a multi-layer systems is a viable and also very effective approach to overcome critical challenges typically associated with the patterning and fabrication of demanding nano-patterned substrates like high-aspect ratio structures often applied e.g. in optical devices. The high etch performance of the systems needed for such pattern transfers is either realized by the fabrication of in situ etch masks or by the preparation of a metal hard mask after the imprint and subsequent etch processes. While it might seem counterintuitive at first glance, to split the different features and functions of one resist into different materials and layers, the overall fabrication process however becomes more inherent robust and is moreover also easier adaptable to changes and modifications like e.g. the use of other substrate materials). Herein, we present in detail different types of multi-layer material systems that are all realized by applying candidates of the mr-NIL210 resist series.", "This manuscript investigates the use of Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) for the development of devices in semiconductor, photonic, and biomedical industries. It focuses on the SmartNIL\u00ae process, a method for patterning nanostructures on various materials. The study highlights the advantages of NIL, such as mass production of micro- and nano-scale structures, and the replication of complex structures. The manuscript discusses the importance of a precisely controlled and uniform residual layer for optimizing the optical performance of photonic components. It compares conventional spin coating with inkjet coating, emphasizing the latter\u2019s superior material efficiency and compatibility with the SmartNIL\u00ae process. Two different resins were investigated: a nano-filler free material, EVG UV/A NIL (n=1.5), and a high refractive index resin containing TiO2 nanoparticles from INKRON (n=1.9). The results for both resins demonstrated excellent pattern fidelity with sharp edges and no filling issues across the entire imprint. The EVG UV/A NIL resin showed a uniform residual layer ranging from 30 to 40nm across the entire area, with the structure height gradually increasing from 80 to 275nm. The INKRON resin displayed a progressive increase in structure height from 68nm to 305 nm, with the thickness of the residual layer varying between 44 and 60nm. The results demonstrate the achievement of a uniform residual layer over a progressive height increasing pattern.", "Eliminating the need for multilayer alignment in nanoscale manufactured devices will streamline the lithography process and open up avenues for flexible substrate roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing.

However, the resolution of this method is limited and depends on the focal length of the write lens used, which means that it is necessary to find a tradeoff between write speed and resolution. In this paper, we will optimize the resolution of i-line direct write processes by applying resolution enhancement techniques, which are well known in stepper lithography. IMS Chips and Heidelberg Instruments collaborated on tuning both process and tool performance with the goal to improve structure density and resolution.", "High\u2013volume\u2013capable Maskless Exposure technology is demonstrated to deliver fast and individualized production abilities for micro-optical applications, individual device labelling and micro\u2013structuring of novel RGB\u2013colored photoresists at the die level.

Research thus far in this area has mostly been focused on patterning of n-type dopants, such as P and As. In this work, we describe the process for fabrication of bipolar dopant-based devices, such as p-n junctions and n-p-n bipolar junction transistors, which may have a number of advantages such as improved gain-bandwidth product and low-noise operation. The P-doped parts of the device are created first, and the B-doped parts are created subsequently, requiring atomically-precise alignment to the P-doped parts. To achieve the necessary patterning precision, we have developed various advances to conventional STMs, including corrections for piezo creep and hysteresis, automatic lattice alignment, and spectroscopic imaging methods to give strong contrast of surface and buried dopants. The overall process described here has become known as Atomically Precise Advanced Manufacturing (APAM), which offers far better patterning precision than conventional techniques such as e-beam lithography.", "For two decades, the Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau has been developing high precision Nanopositioning and Nanomeasuring machines (NPMMs). These have proven their potential for nanometer accurate measurements in large volumes up to 200mm x 200mm x 25mm with 5 axis operation in several fields. As these machines operate according to the highest standards of metrology, offer picometer resolution and nanometer uncertainty, the goal is to transfer their unique precision to fabrication and patterning. So far, the NPMMs have been equipped with laser-based as well as tip-based patterning tools, including one photon and two photon polymerization, nanoimprint, scanning probe lithography and combinations of these technologies. The goal is basic research on these technologies, to tackle the evident challenges and explore the concealed limits to estimate the potential for later use in an industrial scale. In this paper, the specifics and advantages of the NPMMs will be described as well as the micro- and nanofabrication tools that are currently worked on. Focus is on the parameters in measurement mode and the accomplished fabrication results.", "Block copolymers (BCP) self-assemble into a variety of microstructures and controlling the orientation of these structures relative to the substrate surface allows for their use in lithographic techniques. Control over the orientation is non-trivial and requires chemical treatment of the substrate or external fields that can interact and orient these BCP microstructure domains. With this research we highlight a facile thin film casting methodology that produces and orients diblock copolymer microstructure perpendicular to the substrate in the casting process itself. The films are cast from a solvent mixture with a block selective Ionic Liquid (IL) that plasticizes the BCP, enhances repulsive interactions between blocks, and screens preferential interactions between the BCP and the substrate. With a well-developed and fully perpendicular microstructure these films can find applications in sub-20nm lithography processes and as ultrafiltration membranes after selectively etching out the assembled domains.", "The evolution of the photolithographic model has enabled the semiconductor industry to achieve enhanced device efficiency within the consumer electronics domain through the ability to create diminutive shapes and sizes. This historical progression can be delineated into six discernible periods, all of which are based on fundamental elements of a light source and a lens: broadband, i-line, KrF (248nm), dry ArF (193nm), immersion (193nm), and the present environment belonging to the dynamic and evolving Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) generation (13.5nm). Accompanied by this evolution, three supplementary patterning modalities have synergistically evolved to augment and extend the capacities of the lithographic approaches: Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) and Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). The current EUV generation presents unique scaling challenges such as overlay discrepancies, critical dimension (CD) variance, and EUV exposure capacity limitations. To mitigate these scaling impediments and continue the miniaturization trajectory, Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) represents the nascent fourth era of complimentary patterning. DSA has the potential to tackle the foremost triad of scaling challenges pervading the contemporary industry landscape. In this discourse, we shall explain the profound role of DSA in the future of semiconductor fabrication. Specifically, we will critically assess the readiness to produce DSA materials and their potential for continued extension beyond the existing PS-b-PMMA generation platform.", "Continuous scaling by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is tightening the patterning requirements for photoresist materials. Specifically, chemically amplified resists (CAR) are facing significant challenges to keep supporting the patterning needs. In view of this, complementing EUV lithography with directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers offers interesting opportunities to enable the use of CAR towards ultimate resolution. As DSA decouples the resist patterning performance from the final pattern quality, roughness and defects in the resist pattern can be rectified. Here, we discuss the impact of material and process parameters on the rectification performance by DSA, both for line-space and hexagonal contact hole arrays.", "This abstract delves into the evolution and impact of film deposition techniques within the optics and optoelectronics sector, particularly highlighting Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition (SALD) and ATLANT 3D's innovative microreactor Direct Atomic Layer Processing (\u00b5DALP\u2122) technology.

However, the stochastic limitations arising from the patterning processes are still considered a challenge to high-precision pattern transfer. We explore a unique approach combining area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) and vapor phase infiltration (VPI) to fabricate a hard mask layer with atomic precision. In AS-ALD, tuning the precursor provides a variable for achieving selectivity. We develop Al2O3 and HfO2 ALD processes with various precursors and perform AS-ALD over patterned polypeptoid (PP) and polystyrene (PS) brushes as growth and non-growth areas, respectively. Results show that ALD can occur within the PP brushes, while PS brushes can inhibit the adsorption of the precursor. We introduce the effect of ALD precursor selection to achieve high-precision pattern transfer based on the chemical reactivity between ALD precursor and EUV-patterned materials.", "Vapor-phase infiltration (VPI), also known as sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS), utilizes sequential and cyclic infiltration of gaseous organometallic precursors and\u00ac co-reactants into the matrix of organic templates to form inorganic-infused organic-inorganic hybrids that feature uniquely modified material composition, properties, and structures. In this talk, I will highlight our recent efforts on employing VPI of metal oxides for novel patterning applications based on various polymeric templates, such as self-assembled block copolymers (BCPs) and photoresists.

Furthermore, we show the influence of resist aging on the resist response, and ways to correct it by process adaption, as well as we conclude requirements to greyscale photomasks suitable to make use of the full potential of the mr-P 22G_XP resist dedicated for >100\u03bcm deep greyscale patterns.", "Field-effect transistors (FETs) with channels of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) are expected to extend Moore\u2019s law by extreme scaling of contacted gate pitch (CGP) post silicon-sheet-based complementary FET (CFET) devices. The ultrathin body and fully passivated surface of 2D materials result in superior electrostatic control and improved short channel behavior. Challenges such as high contact resistance or lack of doping technology are on the way of 2D-FETs reaching the required performance for high-performance logic applications. Additionally, in order to integrate 2D TMDs in ultra-scaled CMOS devices, developing a patterning scheme via the state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is essential. In this paper we demonstrate our first results on studying the compatibility and interaction of semiconducting 2D TMDs with EUV environment using a set of characterization techniques that are fit to detect qualitative defects and morphological changes in these atomically thin layers. Our study is focused on semiconducting TMDs that are currently the most promising candidates for transistor channels: MoS2 (NMOS) and WSe2 (PMOS). We report the interaction of EUV photons and photo-electrons with blanket films of MoS2 and WSe2 for different EUV doses in vacuum environment.

However since the pattern pitch is getting smaller, pattern collapse issue has been getting sever problem. We developed Organic Dry Development Rinse (O-DDR) process as extension for wet development to prevent the pattern collapse issue without using any special equipment. O-DDR process has been demonstrated the capability to prevent MOR pattern collapse and expand process window with pitch 32nm pillar and pitch 28nm line and space in EUV lithography .

Therefore, the greatest interest of the EUV lithography is sub 10nm resolution patterning capability using high NA optics system. However, EUV chemically amplified resists (CARs) have had big problems about pattern defects due to stochastic effects from photon shot noise and acid diffusion blur less than 13nm HP. There is a trade-off relationship between resolution, line width roughness (LWR), and sensitivity (RLS trade-off). The RLS trade-off problems have come to a head with the progress of pattern miniaturization. The improvement of LWR and sensitivity without degrading the resolution is technically difficult because of acid diffusion and stochastic effect. Moreover, etching durability of CARs are also gradually surfaced as an issue due to reducing film thickness to prevent pattern collapse. The development of a novel platform for high resolution patterning becomes important. Currently, some of the new resist platform have been investigated and metal oxide resist and dry film resist were particularly achieved good patterning performance and etching durability as negative type resist by using metal component in the systems. On the contrary, performances of metal containing positive type resist by treating metal infiltration have not been sufficient to compare with the negative type resists. Sensitivity of non-CAR resists have a limitation by lack of the reaction probability because of only one reaction per photon at maximum. Therefore, including high concentration of EUV absorbing metal component, using chemically amplified reaction or other sensitivity enhancement techniques are necessary to meet the sensitivity requirement for high NA EUV resist. Previously, we proposed a positive tone organometal chemically amplified resist by making dissolution contrast though chain scission and polarity change to develop for butyl acetate. However, sensitivity and resolution were not sufficient as a photoresist for high NA EUV lithography. Although performance can be improved by modification of some structures, at first, we explored a way to significantly improve sensitivity by using PS-CAR process and new acid generator which can change the structure to UV sensitive one by EUV exposure only exposed area because of an aiming to reduce massive power consumption of EUV lithography.", "One of the key steps in the pattern formation chain of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is the development process to resolve the resist pattern after EUV exposure. The traditional development process might be insufficient to achieve the requirements of ultra-high-resolution features with low defect levels. The aim of this paper is to establish a process to achieve a good roughness, a low defectivity at a low EUV dose, and capability for extremely-high-resolution for high numerical aperture (NA) and hyper-NA EUV lithography. A new development method named ESPERT\u2122 (Enhanced Sensitivity develoPER Technology\u2122) has been introduced to improve the performance of metal oxide-resists (MOR). ESPERT\u2122 as a chemical super resolution technique effectively apodized the MOR chemical image, improving chemical gradient (higher exposure latitude (EL)) and reducing scums (fewer bridge defects). This new development method can also keep the resist profile vertical to mitigate the break defects. The performances of the conventional development and ESPERT\u2122 were evaluated and compared using 0.33 NA EUV, 0.5 NA EUV, and electron beam (EB) exposures, for all line-space (LS), contact hole (CH), and pillar (PL) patterns. Using 0.33 NA EUV scanners on LS patterns, both bridge and break defects were confirmed to be reduced for all 32-nm-pitch, 28-nm-pitch, 26-nm-pitch LS patterns while reducing the EUV dose to size (DtS). In the electrical yield (1 meter length) test of breaks/bridges of 26-nm pitch structures, ESPERT\u2122 reduced EUV dose while its combo yield was almost 100% over a wide dose range of 20mJ/cm\u00b2. For CH patterns, in the case of 32-nm-pitch AEI (after etch inspection), EL was increased 7.5% up to 22.5%, while failure free latitude (FFL) was widened from 1-nm to 4-nm. A 16-nm-pitch LS pattern was successfully printed with 0.5 NA tool, while a 16-nm-pitch PL and an 18-nm-pitch CH patterns were also achieved with an EB lithography by ESPERT\u2122. With ESPERT\u2122, there was no pillar collapse observed for 12-nm half-pitch PL by 0.5 NA and 8-nm half-pitch PL by EB. With all the advantages of having a high exposure sensitivity, a low defectivity, and an extremely-high-resolution capability, this advanced development method is expected be a solution for high-NA EUV towards hyper-NA EUV lithography.", "High numerical aperture (NA) EUV lithography is considered as the most-promising candidate for next generation lithography protocol that will play a crucial role in meeting the demand on the enhanced semiconductor performance and productivity. While this technology enables the fabrication of sub-10 nm patterns, the increased NA has posed challenges, such as reduced depth of focus and narrower process margins. To overcome these hurdles, it is essential to apply thinner resist films while ensuring that the resulting small patterns maintain sufficient physical and chemical durability. Moreover, considering that thinner films absorb fewer photons, the resist molecular structure should be designed to compensate sensitivity burdens. Here, an approach has been proposed to enhance sensitivity by accelerating the solubility change of a well-known tinbased nanocluster resist. To accomplish this goal, it is important to increase not only the number of secondary electrons but also reaction sites and promote radical-based chemical reactions. We aimed at experimentally validating this concept by utilizing elements with high EUV absorbance and highly reactive functional groups with tin radicals. As a model resist, we chose a tin-oxo cage material consisting of a divalent cation containing 12 tin atoms and two counter anions. Our findings indicate that the introduction of unsaturated groups capable of building bridging bonds with radicals leads to fast solubility change at a lower exposure dose, thus enhancing sensitivity. This research offers a promising direction for the development of resists tailored for High NA EUV lithography.", "Airborne molecular contaminants (AMCs) in the cleanroom have been known to impact the performance of photoresist materials. Here, we investigate the effect of the environment composition during post-exposure delay (PED) on metal oxide resists (MOR). We applied specific environments during a fixed PED time and measured the impact of each condition on the printed L/S patterns by measuring the change in the final critical dimension (CD) in each case compared to a reference control. We performed chemical analysis to elucidate which chemical changes take place in the resist under the conditions that induced the largest CD changes. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the CD change after a fixed PED time depends on two main variables: the concentration of contaminants and the humidity of the environment. The chemical analysis after a PED in the presence of contaminants and humidity revealed that extra ligand cleavage takes place under these conditions compared to the reference non-delayed conditions. The results show that deviations from the target CD in MOR can be prevented by having control over humidity, contaminant levels, and PED time during processing. Furthermore, new optimized formulations designed to hinder extra chemical reactions during PED show a stable CD even when the PED was applied in environments with humidity and contaminants.", "Chemically amplified resists (CARs) have been widely used for lithography of semiconductors. To suppress stochastic defects, the increase in the number of absorbed photons is essential and the increase in acid generator concentration is needed to capture all the generated electrons. Therefore, the effect of the acid generators on the dissolution of the resist increased. In this study, radiation-induced decomposition of acid generator and dissolution of poly(4-vinylphenol) (PHS) containing 30 wt% of acid generators was investigated using pulse radiolysis, \u03b3 radiolysis, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) methods. TPS-TF was used as the reference structure, and three acid generators with different anionic and cationic structures were prepared, respectively. The structure of the cation was found to affect the decomposition product ratio of the final product. Both cation and anion structures were found to affect the dissolution behavior of the PHS films.", "Chemically amplified photoresists (CAR) are the leading photoresists used in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Chemical stochastics are an issue for defectivity and roughness due to the distribution of the multiple components of the resist. It is believed that the non-random distribution of components occurs primarily during the spin coating process, as the resist dries, and the solvent concentration is reduced. Inhibiting the unwanted chemical segregation can be controlled by increasing the evaporation rate during the spin coating process. In addition to reducing the chemical segregation of the resist through the spin coating process, it is important to compare between different resist formulations for their risk of chemical segregation. We will show accelerated testing processes using solvent vapor annealing to help identify the relative risk of segregation between multiple commercial photoresists.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) enables integrated circuit (IC) industry to manufacture chips with increased transistor density per volume unit, so the Moore\u2019s law remains true to date. To support the endless requirement of reducing critical dimension (CD), chemically amplified resist (CAR) has been designed to address the resolution, line width roughness, and sensitivity (RLS) in nanoscale level. However, a good Litho performance from an EUV photoresist may not always be transferred into a good etch performance, limiting the stochastic defects after patten transfer is the key to achieve a good after etch inspection (AEI) defectivity. In this paper, we report the EUV photoresist design strategies to acquire good AEI defectivity with the understanding of CAR\u2019s property in a defined pattern transfer scheme with special focus on small molecule in photoresist. The CAR\u2019s Litho performance and the corelated etch performance will be discussed, the component etch rate and its correlation to photoresist etch performance will be covered.", "In this study, we focus on examining the stability of Al-based inorganic-organic hybrid thin films deposited through the molecular atomic layer deposition (MALD) process in ambient environment. Our observations reveal an initial reduction in material thickness within the first 3 days, followed by a period of stability. XPS analysis is employed to further investigate the chemical alternations in the aged Al-based hybrid thin films, revealing an increase in C=O species as well as overall oxygen content in the material. We also evaluate the effects of atmospheric exposure on the sensitivity of the Al-based hybrid thin films using electron flood exposure. This study aims to enhance the understanding of the stability of a vapor-phase synthesized hybrid thin film system for advanced resist applications.", "EUV photon-generated primary and secondary electrons, produced by a cascade of inelastic scattering events, have a wide range of energies and drive EUV patterning by initiating chemical transformations. To study electron-induced chemistry we exposed photoresist films to an electron beam varied from 20 to 80 eV. Chemical transformations were characterized using a residual gas analyzer, FTIR, and ellipsometry. Total outgassing was determined for key fragments and compared to film thickness changes via ellipsometry and FTIR bond structure changes. Estimates of electron penetration depth and reaction efficiency (bonds broken per electron) will be presented.", "For the advancement of lithography, the resist materials and processes are the most critical issue in the microfabrication of semiconductors. Especially in the sub-20nm half pitch resolution region, the development process of resist materials is of particular importance from the viewpoint of reducing the line width roughness (LWR) and stochastic defects. In this study, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method was used to investigate the dissolution dynamics of poly(4-hydroxystyrene-co-methacrylic acid) (PHSMA) films in tetraalkylammonium hydroxide aqueous solutions. The PHSMA film showed a characteristic dissolution kinetics in tetraalkylammonium hydroxide aqueous solutions, which was not observed for poly(4-hydroxystyrene) film.", "Augmented reality glasses offer the potential to seamlessly integrate digital information into the world to enable users to maintain a strong situational awareness of the physical world while interacting with content. This awareness is particularly important in mobile computing scenarios, as users move through uncontrolled environments. For users to be comfortable wearing AR glasses in public spaces and for extended durations, they need to be in a compact, lightweight, and socially acceptable form factor, such as today\u2019s prescription glasses. At the same time, it is helpful to provide users a large field-of-view image with high image quality\u2014placing strong demands on optical architectures and underlying materials. We\u2019ll discuss how material properties and processes constrain the performance of AR glasses, and the potential to enable higher performance in a smaller form factor. We\u2019ll describe considerations for optical waveguide substrates, coatings, and patterning processes, with discussion of impacts to both display and sensor systems. Finally, we\u2019ll highlight areas for materials and process improvements that could have large positive impacts on the AR glasses field.", "Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have come under increased scrutiny because all members of this class of compounds exhibit very high environmental persistence (vP), and some exhibit toxicity (T) and/or bioaccumulation (B) potential. Because of these attributes, PFAS chemicals are being scrutinized by regulatory authorities for restrictions on use and releases to the environment. At the same time, PFAS are crucial components of many process materials used in semiconductor photolithography, to the extent that manufacture of advanced chips is currently not possible without them. While PFAS uses are crucial, the amounts used in these key applications are small relative to global PFAS production and use, a fact that may not be generally known. The purpose of this paper is to provide a quantitative assessment of the amount of PFAS used in semiconductor photolithography, and to present a mass balance model for the disposition of these materials into the different waste streams. This model allows identification of key areas for prioritized action, including the need for targeted research and development.", "The decomposition of poly(phthalaldehyde) with a photoacid generator can be used as dry-develop photoresist, where the exposed film depolymerizes into small molecules to allow the development of features via controlled vaporization. Higher temperatures enabled shorter dry-development times, but also promote faster photoacid diffusion that compromised pattern fidelity. Trihexylamine was used as a base quencher to counteract acid diffusion in a phthalaldehyde-propanal co-polymer photoresist. The propanal co-monomer in the polymer improves the vaporization rate because it has a higher vapor pressure than phthalaldehyde. The dry-development of 4\u03bcm features was achieved with no appreciable residue.", "With the adoption of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) to decrease microelectronic device dimensions, recent photoresist research has focused on the development of next generation metal-organic resist materials. To enhance lithographic capabilities and mitigate common drawbacks seen from traditional solvent based processes like spin coating and solution phase development, interest has shifted towards solvent-free \u201cdry\u201d deposition and development. These dry techniques can obviate extra processing steps, significantly reduce the amount of solvent waste generated, and even allow for reduced defect density and higher resolution. The process described herein avoids the use of solvents, and ultimately many issues associated with solvents, by depositing metal-organic resists using atomic/molecular layer deposition (ALD/MLD) and developing them using a selective thermal dry etching process. The low temperature (e.g., 100-120\u00b0C) thermal development conditions used in this study are notable in the context of lithography processes, as the high temperatures required in other dry etching processes can be difficult to implement in nanofabrication processes. Our previous work has focused on using amorphous zinc-imidazolate (aZnMIm) films in an all-dry resist technology, achieving resolution down to 22nm. Here, we explore the role of temperature and time on dry development and examine pattern transfer into silicon substrates. Preliminary pattern transfer experiments suggest that an etch selectivity of at least 7:1 exists for electron-beam treated aZnMIm over silicon using a pseudo-Bosch plasma etch. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of dry development at lower temperatures and times and suggest potential for aZnMIm as a high-resolution resist for nextgeneration lithography.", "The main challenge in developing a suitable EUV photoresist, particularly for high Numerical Aperture (NA) EUV lithography anticipated for late 2024, lies in the Resolution, Line Width Roughness, and Sensitivity (RLS) trade-off. PiBond has been actively addressing this challenge by developing silicon photoresist (SiPR) based on chemically modified HSQ siloxane chemistry, consisting of a single polymer component. This resist, a non-metal negative tone, high Si-containing, employs the industry-standard TMAH developer. Previously, we achieved a resolution of 32nm pitch with a dose of 170mJ/cm2 and a Line Width Roughness (LWR) of 5.3nm. In this study, we synthesized a novel chemically modified HSQ-type siloxane resist to enhance RLS characteristics, assessing its performance using both Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) and EUVL. Utilizing the EUV Interference Lithography tool at PSI, we obtained a 28nm pitch resolution with an improved LWR of approximately 3.2nm, while controlling the dose-to-size to about 120mJ/cm2. Furthermore, by employing a suitable silicon hard mask underlayer developed in-house, we further enhanced sensitivity by 24% at 28nm pitch and 38% at 30nm pitch resolution. Crucially, we established correlations between EBL and EUV for our SiPR, leveraging the accessibility of EBL compared to EUV tools. Leveraging these correlations, we effectively utilized EBL to investigate the newly synthesized resist and optimize processing conditions. Our findings demonstrate the significant impact of both resist functionalization and processing conditions on the final lithography performance.", "Roll-to-Plate (R2P) large-area Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) is a leading technology to replicate complex textures onto various substrate materials. It combines the accuracy of UV imprinting with large-area display manufacturing methods. This is a significantly cost-effective manner to perform micro and nano surface patterning for a plurality of display optics applications, including emerging technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR) waveguides. Even though NIL technology is advancing to comply with the strict quality requirements of waveguide manufacturing, many challenges still remain. Hereby, we address different aspects that need to be considered to make R2P-NIL a viable mass manufacturing method for AR optics, focusing on scalability and quality. We discuss the potential for scalable waveguide manufacturing, through waveguide upscaling for large-area NIL (Gen5 size, 1100 mm x 1300 mm), in combination with the usage of square high refractive index glass substrates (in contrast to the usual round wafers). By making optimal use of this combination, we demonstrate that 480 waveguides can be manufactured in one imprint cycle. Additionally, of equal importance to scalability, high waveguide quality is achieved through the use of high refractive index materials, maintaining of imprint fidelity, and control of the residual layer thickness and its variation. We show that, using the R2P-NIL technology of Morphotonics to replicate AR waveguides, imprint fidelity of binary, blazed and slanted gratings are retained over repeating imprint cycles.", "Advancements in Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality technology have increased the demand for methods of printing three-dimensional structures. In this contribution we will talk about these technology improvements applied to Surface Relief Gratings \u2013 considering photoresists and Nanoimprint layer materials for making a grating, as well as Gap Fill materials for adjusting the refractive index (RI). We will discuss in detail a developed positive tone, i-line photoresist formulation which has been developed for greyscale lithography. We will introduce a range of nanoimprint materials and show the developments of our Ink Jet Printable (IJP) low absorption, high RI gap fill formulations. These innovative formulations are made possible by utilizing a unique precursor and employing special process conditions for optical grating applications.", "Breakthroughs in holographic optical devices frequently rely on advances in high-refractive-index photopolymer materials (HRIPs). While significant progress has been made in the pursuit of HRIPs, additional considerations have prevented broad application of photopolymerization-based materials for fabricating high-performance holographic gratings. To address the deficiency of suitable high-refractive-index monomers for holographic recording, our recent works were conducted from two main aspects, which are (1) monomer synthesis to improve the theoretical refractive index contrast between photopolymer and matrix (or binder), and (2) formulation manipulation for improving segregation degree between photopolymer and matrix (or binder). We have explored several synthetic approaches to obtain high-refractive-index acrylate monomers (nD=1.6) of high miscibility with matrix, multifunctional low-viscosity, high-refractive-index thiol-ene and thiol-yne monomers (nD=1.6). Combining with polyurethane matrix (binder) with a refractive index of 1.48, these monomers exhibit a high theoretical peak-to-valley index contrast of more than 0.12. To fully utilize the high theoretical index contrast, thiol-ene click chemistry in combination with a linear functionalized polymer binder was explored to achieve a high refractive index modulation(peak-to-mean) close to 0.04. Meanwhile, in the thiol-ene formulations, a variety of chemical modification methods, which can be readily translated into other material systems, were proposed, and studied to manipulate the rates of reaction and diffusion processes during holographic recording to optimize the refractive index modulation. The dramatic difference of achievable refractive index modulation in similar thiol-ene formulations with close theoretical index contrast was observed in such study. The difference underscores the importance of customized strategies and systematic formulation manipulation for achieving high-performance holographic photopolymers.", "With the advent of novel optical and photonic devices such as Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), there is renewed interest in Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) technology as a cost-effective approach to manufacture key performance enhancing components for these devices, such as surface relief gratings (SRGs) for waveguides. We have developed multiple types of resists for use in NIL for making Surface Relief Gratings (SRGs) for waveguides for AR and MR devices. This paper will discuss the NIL performance of our resists such as high refractive index functional NIL resists, resists for NIL-Etch process as we11 as resists for Bi-layer NIL-Etch approach for patterning high aspect ratio structures. We wi11 discuss various material properties and performance of the NIL resists in NIL process.", "Optics is increasingly important in modern life, and advances in nanostructure-based flat optical devices hold great promise for revolutionary new opportunities in the display space. Augmented Reality (AR) are expected to enable the next ubiquitous computing and communication platform. Augmented Reality, especially, is a transformational new category of display that allows for the overlay of timely, location-based, or other useful information on the user\u2019s natural view of the surrounding world. The Photonics Platforms group at Applied Materials is enabling higher brightness, thinner and lighter-weight optical systems with precise wavefront engineering to make possible novel optical devices. We have leveraged Applied Materials\u2019 materials engineering expertise to develop a platform for the precision fabrication of nanostructured optical devices on 300mm glass wafers, as well as metrology, optical performance characterization, and back-end assembly of these devices. With this platform, we are producing top of the art waveguide combiners for AR applications and optical metasurfaces for multi-functional wavefront control in the near infrared.", "The organic non-chemically amplified resist (non-CAR) materials have been developed for fine pitch contact hole patterning process to remove the acid blur of conventional chemically amplified resist (CAR) system, but non-CAR materials usually show lower contrast and sensitivity compared to conventional CAR materials, so additional improvements are needed for practical application. In this study, we developed new platforms of EUV PTD resist materials to overcome these limitations and enable fine pitch C/H patterning. The main target of our study is to reduce acid blur and to maintain chemical contrast compared to conventional CAR system by 1) finding better EUV-active structures, or 2) simultaneously generating polarity switching and molecular weight (M.W.) change, or 3) maximizing the M.W. change through the depolymerization. Those new resist materials have confirmed showing equivalent or higher contrast compared to conventional CAR, and also having good resolution in EUV C/H patterning evaluation.", "In this work, we introduce the novel resist of ZR13D for high-NA\u2019s generation and report their patterning performance in both ADI and AEI which was compared to the reference resist of ZER02#04DM. Zeon resists have some challenges that LCDU and dose to size are still high and resolution and defectivity should be improved as well. The concreate approaches in order to improve the challenges are that to make scission reaction efficient and to get developability more at exposed area higher in changing both monomers and functional groups. By both effects, Zeon aims to make clear threshold between exposed and un-exposed area and improve low contrast and sensitivity at tight patterns especially. Zeon has developed a new resist (ZR13D, R&D sample) in order to improve their challenges. ZR13D enabled to improve the contrast by EUV when compared to ZER02#04DM significantly. The litho-performance was able to be enhanced on both sensitivity and LCDU by breaking though RLS trade-off. And ZR13D could transfer patterns well in etching process, and then, holes with Zeon resists in AEI enabled to go through until the bottom of SiN substrate without residues. Additionally, ZR13D has maintained the stability of process delay from EUV expose to development process for stitching. It was clarified that ZR13D has the sufficient potential to be utilized at high-NA generation.", "We investigate indium nitrate hydrate films as a potential extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resist using electron beam (e-beam) exposure. Indium has an EUV absorption cross-section comparable to tin, the metal element in the state-of-the-art inorganic EUV resists. We choose indium nitrate salts as the metal precursor to minimize residual carbon in the resist. With a calibrated e-beam flood gun, we test the solubility switch in indium nitrate hydrate films as a function of e-beam energy. The resist becomes insoluble upon exposure to the e-beam, exhibiting a negative tone characteristic. The solubility switch occurs for e-beam energy from 500eV down to 92eV, the energy of the EUV photons. Furthermore, to determine the mechanism behind the solubility switch, we study the chemical changes upon e-beam exposure using operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and residual gas analysis. The resists show similar optical contrast and nitric oxide release for three post-application bake (PAB) conditions. The sensitivity and contrast of indium nitrate hydrate are determined from the dose curves obtained using electron beam lithography (EBL) and e-beam flood gun. We obtained an average sensitivity of 226\u00b146\u03bcC/cm2 from four EBL experiments and a contrast of \u03b3=1.3\u00b10.3. The results from the e-beam flood gun have a sensitivity of 295\u03bcC/cm2 and \u03b3=1.0. A benchmarking experiment was also performed using an e-beam flood gun on organotin (SnOxo) resist, which has a sensitivity of 165\u03bcC/cm2 and \u03b3=1.6. The similar characteristics between these two resists indicate that indium nitrate hydrate films hold high promise to be a sensitive EUV resist.", "Irresistible Materials is developing a novel photoresist for EUV lithography including high-NA patterning. A major concern for the key research area of high-NA EUV resists is that stochastics in such resist materials can lead both to roughness and defects causing failures, which means high-NA resists remain a priority research area. We are developing a photoresist based on the multi-trigger concept, which seeks to suppress line edge roughness using a new photoresist mechanism, and which is based on molecular rather than polymeric materials to maximize resolution. It also has relatively high EUV absorbance to increase photon capture despite the need for thin films in high-NA due to limited depth-of-focus. By modifying the MTM molecule, crosslinker and PAG, both individually and in combination, we can optimize the reaction rates in the MTR mechanism. Different combinations have been designated Gen 2.1 to Gen 2.6 and show an LWR improvement in Gen 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 combinations. Here we present the lithographic performance at pitch 28nm dense line/space where 14.1 wide lines were patterned at 59mJ/cm2 with an unbiased LER of 2.09nm using a Gen 2.4 resist. We show hexagonal pillar results: pitch 32nm patterned at 42mJ/cm2 to obtain a pillar diameter of 16nm with an unbiased LCDU of 2.8nm; and additionally p32 pillars of 16nm diameter were patterned at 74mJ/cm2 with an unbiased LCDU of 2.7nm; and of 18.5nm diameter at 82mJ/cm2 with an unbiased LCDU of 2.3nm. We also show data which shows using a Gen 2.6 resist can reduce the LCDU of p32 hex pillars by 0.2nm and biased LWR of p28 l/s by 0.3nm compared to a comparable Gen 2.4 resist. Performance improvements such as reduced roughness and defectivity can also be shown to be affected by choices such as underlayer and developer. Additionally, the modification of the developer can be shown to influence the patterning performance of the resist at high resolution.", "As Moore\u2019s Law intensifies the demand for higher transistor density, photoresists grapple with challenges posed by shorter wavelengths, especially in speed and stochastic factors. We aim to address these by molecularly optimizing photosensitive materials for precise control at molecular level. Our approach employs sequence-defined polypeptoids, specifically tailored to integrate metal atoms with high EUV absorption, improving both stochastic properties and photoresist sensitivity. Through the sub-monomer peptoid synthesis, we've crafted materials embedding acid-labile groups like tert-butyloxycarbonyl (tBOC) derivatives for solubility switch and 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives for metal binding. Our in-depth study into peptoid structures and their metal atom positioning offers insights for future lithography techniques. Our ongoing efforts focus on refining these sequences and fine-tuning the exposure process, showcasing our commitment to advancing EUV lithography's capabilities.", "Built on the previous study on the negative-tone resist platform, we developed a series of new resists with higher thermal stability enabling PEB temperature above 80\u00b0C, with improved pattern quality. Peripheral materials, including developers and under layers, are investigated as well to mitigate pattern collapse and enable patterning line/space below 32nm pitch with LER of 3nm or less. The resists are also capable of printing pillar pattern below 34nm pitch with LCDU below 3nm. A combination of EUV and DSA rectification processes reduces cost of ownership (COO) and attains low roughness with defectivity improvement potentially. The process has great potential in extending resolution below 28nm pitch using 0.33 NA EUV.", "Alternative patterning solutions, such as litho-freeze-litho-etch (LFLE) and spacer-based pitch splitting, have been a cornerstone of advanced technology nodes to enable device scaling. The greatest utility comes from the ability to self-align a pitch splitting process; however, traditional spacer-based patterning techniques require the deposition and etch of multiple materials, which reduce throughput and increase manufacturing costs. Anti-spacer technology, on the other hand, enables both self-aligned pitch splitting and high throughput via a single pass track-based process. Here, we present the utility of combining a 193nm immersion anti-spacer process with LFLE to enable the formation of sub-20nm slot contact features for a minimum tip-to-tip cut, with a scaling path to achieve sub-12nm cuts.", "To continue the future of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) manufacturing with EUV and high NA EUV, alternative techniques for nanofabrication are required to reduce the cost and simplify the processes. In this report, we present the results of the development of a single mask solution with 0.33NA EUV lithography for two important layers, bit-line-periphery (BLP) and storage-node-landing-pad (SNLP), in DRAM manufacturing. The methodology has been established for our examination and assessment of the process window (PW) of the critical dimensions (CD) and the defectivity of the SNLP and BLP layers. Based on this methodology, a pitch 34nm DRAM has been optimized with the spin-on metal oxide resist (MOR) and dark field of a binary mask. We obtained the large overlapping PW of CDs (with a depth of focus of 119nm and an exposure latitude of 25% at a dose-to-size of 89.4mJ cm-2) in the free-defect ranges (20mJ cm-2). We achieved around ~22% dose reduction using the same processes with spin-on MOR applied to the new design of a low-n mask. We observed a pitch of 32nm SNLP and BLP with a single mask layer due to a low-n mask. Additionally, the process window discovery (PWD) methodology for defect inspection in the large area of SNLP and BLP shows good progress which can be applied for optimized conditions. We believe that our results show the resolution limit of 0.33NA lithography for the single mask print SNLP-BLP and 0.55NA EUV is needed for the next generations of DRAM.", "In 2019, finally, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has been applied to high volume manufacturing (HVM). However, the performance of EUV resist materials are still not enough for the expected HVM requirements, even by using the latest qualifying EUV resist materials. The critical issues were the stochastic, which will be become \u2018defectivity\u2019. The analyzing summary of the stochastic factors in EUV lithography was reported, which described 2 (two) major stochastic issues, which are \u2018Photon stochastic\u2019 and \u2018Chemical stochastic\u2019. In the past, speaking of the stochastic issue was basically considered from low photon number from EUV light source, which means \u2018photon shot noise\u2019. It was still critical concerning point, even with recent progress on source power improvement. However, the stochastic issue is not only from them but also from EUV materials and processes, called \u2018Chemical stochastic\u2019. The \u2018Chemical stochastic\u2019 means caused from resist materials and processes for lithography, materials uniformity in the film, reactive uniformity in the film, and dissolving behavior with the developer. The 1st preliminary results of newly proposed novel formulated organic solvent-based developer for negative-tone development of chemically amplified resist (CAR) with EUV exposure, called CAR EUV-NTD, were reported in last conference, SPIE AL 2023. In this paper, we will also focus on EUV CAR-NTD with New developer, continuously. The mechanisms of new developer behavior for pattern collapse improvement and chemical stochastic reduction. Also, the lithographic performance will also be reported, including underlayer influence.", "Advanced AI systems require more exotic packaging solutions to increase performance and manage power loads. Packaging designers not only need increased interconnect density through pitch scaling, but also seek to print this advantage over areas beyond the capability of standard lithography. These demands call for innovations in materials, processes, integrations, and tools for packaging. In a bid to find solutions for finer L/S pattern in redistribution layers, photo-imageable polyimides (PIDs) from different vendors were tested for performance properties (resolution, dose to size, sidewall quality) using direct write exposure methods, and then assessed for compatibility in a dual damascene (DD) integration for FOWLP packaging.", "Spin-on Metal Oxide Resist (MOR), Underlayer for EUV lithography and Spin-on Metal Hard Masks (MHM) are being studied for next generation semiconductor processes. Despite the immense potential of these new materials, the industry has paid enormous attention to avoid due to the general concern about trace metal impurities. Purposely introducing these metal-containing materials will inevitably raise alert, especially for track processes involving spin-coat layers that are currently handling primarily high purity organic materials. To address this new application challenge, or more specifically to protect the wafer edges from metal contamination during track processes, the authors have developed wafer Edge Protection Layer (EPL) material. EPL allows the wafer edge protection when the metal-containing coating is applied and the clean stripping with a proprietary solvent, EBR ACE to yield bevel and backside metal-free wafers that could be further processed as usual. This paper provides the key technical details of EPL material, process, and performance, with the aim to offer the industry a practical solution for safely introducing metal-containing spin-coat layers.", "The next generation of this technology (using a high-numerical aperture (NA) at 0.55 compared to the present at 0.33) is also currently being prepared and is scheduled to be production ready within the next few years. However, it is well known that the application of higher NA will lead to smaller depth of focus (DOF). The DOF with NA 0.55 systems will reduce to 1/3 of the value that we have in current 0.33 NA systems, i.e. if DOF at NA 0.33 is 100nm then at NA 0.55, DOF will be around 30 to 40nm. At these exposure conditions, wafer surface distortions as an effect of backside defects will become significant concern. In this study, the wafer backside at exactly the same locations detected as where these abnormal CD\u2019s were detected on wafer frontside. And the evidence was shown that the backside defects affected to frontside pattern deformation. Furthermore, it was found that an effective backside cleaning process can mitigate pattern defocus caused by these wafer backside particles.", "Pattern collapse emerges as a key factor leading to the failure of photoresist patterns in high-resolution EUV lithography. Its significance escalates as feature sizes decrease and pitches become smaller transitioning to high-NA EUV, potentially leading to challenges with regards to resolution. Collapse arises from capillary forces acting on the resist surface during wafer drying. Consequently, the optimal strategy to mitigate pattern collapse involves eliminating any drying steps post-lithography processing. In this study, we introduce the O-DDR process for spin-on MOR, effectively eliminating capillarity and eradicating the pattern collapse issue without tone inversion. Figure 1 illustrates the O-DDR process, which involves dispensing O-DDR material instead of employing a spin-drying developer, without introducing any extra processing steps. After the dry etching process, we observe that the resist pattern remains intact without any collapse. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis of the O-DDR process, with the goal of expanding the window for a failure-free process with pitch 32nm pillars and pitch 28nm line and space in EUV lithography.", "This work will describe the advancement of 193i anti-spacer technology to resolve critical trench dimensions beyond the resolution of single print EUV lithography. A through process performance evaluation will be provided for 13nm trench features from 100nm to 60nm pitch and below. A cursory review of sub-13nm feature scaling and the material factors to enable such trench dimensions will be described. The extension of 193i chemistry and associated layers to intercept EUV patternability requires an understanding of fundamental process parameters and process windows beyond standard practices. Herein, a full study of key anti-spacer parameters and their associated effects on roughness and CDU will be provided. Such variables will include resist film thickness, developer optimization and overcoat dissolution. Lastly, we will outline the ultimate scaling potential of the defined 193i anti-spacer flow and provide future avenues of development to achieve greater scaling at EUV and towards High NA EUV dimensions.", "A large screening of underlayer materials for extreme ultraviolet lithography is reported in this work. The main motivation for the screening of functional materials lies in the search for dose reduction and defect mitigation. Some promising results shown in here prove that the usage of functionalized underlayers and primers improves the pattern quality without adding to the complexity of litho processing.", "As the industry enters Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) era, like every technology generation in history, there are constant demands for new materials to solve the emerging challenges accompanying with the continuous scaling effort. Although Chemically Amplified Resist (CAR) resist and conventional tri-layer stack that were established for DUV lithography have been successfully extended to EUV, challenges such as limited etch budget associated with further resist thickness shrinking needed for high Numerical Aperture (NA) EUV, increased line wiggling in SOC layer resulting from larger aspect ratio, etc., are expected to bring CAR EUV lithography to it\u2019s end soon. While new resist platform such as Metal Oxide Resist (MOR) is expected to provide the needed solution for future, other approaches such as further optimization of the underlayer (UL) could also offer an alternate solution by extending the utilization of CAR. In this paper, we explored the possibility of using spin-on metal-oxide hard mask (SOMHM) materials as UL for CAR EUV lithography. We first demonstrated excellent etch selectivity between CAR and SOMHM UL, as well as that between UL and other hard mask layers such as SOC, SiN or SiOx, in P44 pattern transfer study. Further P32 full wafer investigation allowed us to examine the critical parameters such as LER and LWR. Studies of even smaller pitches of 28nm and 24nm showed more advantages of SOMHM UL due to the etch budget limit of CAR. The possibility of simplifying the standard tri-layer stack is also demonstrated by using SOMHM as the direct hard mask for pattern transfer into 60nm SiN.", "Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has emerged as the state-of-the-art technology for high-resolution patterning in semiconductor manufacturing. However, several challenges persist in the performance of current EUV photoresists, particularly in improving resolution, sensitivity, and line-edge roughness (LER), and local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU). In this study, we describe a novel chemical trimming overcoat process as a highly versatile post-lithography spin-on overcoat to enhance photoresist performance in EUVL, enabling significant dose reduction and z-factor improvement.", "Metal oxide resists (MORs) have become one of the most attractive photoresist platforms that allow for high resolution and etch bias of small features while having a robust lithography performance. In this work, we present our study about improving line fidelity and reducing the dose of MOR for line space EUV lithography by applying spin-on underlayers (ULs). It is known that MOR patterning is induced by the activation during exposure and condensation of the active sites. Herein, we discuss the influence of ULs on MOR performance. A series of ULs with various chemistry, thickness, or process conditions were screened with MOR using NXE3400 EUV exposure system to print 14-nm HP line-space features. The results show that the nanobridges and scum can be alleviated, while the remaining resist thickness after development can be improved by up to 20% along with 5 to 10% dose reductions. A comprehensive assessment of the ULs encompassing various chemistries examines coating quality, uniformity, and surface energy. The discussion delves into the correlation between the surface properties including morphology, interaction, etc., and their respective impacts on lithography performance. Lastly, some spin-on ULs produce up to 75% reduction of metal diffusion from the MOR into the underlying layers.", "For EUV high NA lithography, current conventional tri-layer and tetra-layer process might face the critical issue both for EUV lithographic performance and pattern etch transfer. Especially since the latest EUV PR including CAR and MOR is very low film thickness around 10nm after development, the bottom under layer such as Si containing hard mask (Si-HM) or EUV under layer should be around 5nm FTK. In this case, it is too difficult to transfer to SOC or bottom hard mask layer. In order to prevent this critical issue, we propose new functional surface treatment process and primers (FSTP) on the conventional CVD and spin on hard mask. This FSTP is a spin coating material. However it is almost single molecular type ultra-thin primer (~1nm) for all of the CVD and spin on hard mask (SiON, SiN, TiN, SiO2, SiHM, SOG and so on) not to bother fine pitch pattern transfer. In our recent experimental, one of the FSTP has high universality to EUV PR CAR and MOR to achieve high patterning performance in EUVL. Moreover, the other one of the FSTP specially optimized for MOR process showed 20~30% dose reduction on inorganic substrate. Therefore FSTP has big advantage and potential in EUV lithographic process and pattern etch transfer enhancement for next generation High NA EUV process.", "As the awareness of climate change and sustainability grows, industries are placing more commitment to reduce their environmental footprint. Semiconductor companies are no exception, and many are now working to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adopt greener practices as crucial steps towards a more environmentally responsible future. Amongst the top sustainability challenges faced in semiconductor manufacturing, electricity consumption emerges as a critical concern, with lithography tools requiring a substantial amount of energy to operate. As a track vendor, reducing energy consumption and optimizing tool efficiency are ongoing challenges at SCREEN, where hotplate processes rank amongst the most energy-intensive operations, especially during the bake of underlayer materials that require high temperatures to achieve full film densification. This paper shows an innovative energy-efficient process as a viable alternative to conventional spin-on carbon (SOC) and spin-on glass (SOG) thermal crosslinking systems. We deeply explore the feasibility to use an overall-wafer exposure system integrated on SCREEN\u2019s DT-3000 track to harden underlayer materials specifically designed to crosslink via light, without the need of heat. We demonstrate how migration from a hotplate process to a 100% optical curing mechanism can lead to outstanding savings in energy and process time, while keeping the lithographic performance.", "A non-PFAS biomass EUV resist is proposed as a sustainable material for reducing PFAS and CO2 emissions. It was demonstrated that HP 8nm L/S pattern formation with a non-PFAS biomass EUV resist for beyond 2nm node. Furthermore, biomass developer and rinse for non-PFAS biomass EUV resists are proposed to improve biomass content. This proves that the non-PFAS biomass EUV resist can be used in high-NA EUV lithography at 8nm.", "It is extremely important to reduce CO2 in the world and to achieve carbon neutral. Various bio-based green materials using biomass made from plants/woods are proposed for achieving carbon neutral. This paper describes biomass developer solvent made from plants for lithography application. CO2 is markedly reduced, and it is reported reusing of the biomass developer after development process.", "Metal oxide photoresists are recognized as an integral component in the high\u2013numerical aperture future of EUV lithography and the challenging feature sizes required at associated nodes. Many properties of these materials, such as their high EUV absorptivity, etch selectivity, and relatively small molecular size are particularly beneficial for enabling the advancement of lithographic processes. To help ease process development efforts involving these materials, a previously reported rigorous stochastic lithography model has been built using in-depth knowledge of the chemical and material processes that govern the behavior of spin-on metal oxide resists. Experimental data from a series of measurement techniques were used to both define and parametrize the fundamental equations that underlie the lithographic performance of these materials. The resulting parameters were then calibrated to a dataset derived from an extensive series of CD-SEM and open-frame exposures. In this model update, the match between simulated data and experiment has been improved both by more targeted calibration efforts and by the inclusion of more diverse exposure measurements into the calibration dataset. Interrogating the changes necessary to improve performance provides insights into resist behavior and how disparate process steps are interrelated. The updated model is used to simulate a series of exposure conditions outside of the calibration dataset to both validate the model and show its capabilities. Together, the fundamental nature of the model and the insights gained through its calibration provide a powerful tool to drive process optimization for metal oxide materials.", "For designing high-resolution integrated circuits, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography using 13.5-nm light is indispensable; however, stochastic issues which can result in pattern roughness and stochastic defects have yet to be resolved. Many of these issues can relate to the low photon density when compared to DUV lithography. To resolve stochastic concerns in chemically amplified (CA) photoresists, it is important to use appropriate photoacid generator (PAG). EUV PAGs are designed to capture secondary electrons that originate from EUV irradiation to the photoresists. Herein, we focused on in silico analysis of C-S bond cleavage of sulfonium cation series, which is a well-known mechanism in production of photogenerated acids. Change in cation types or substituted functional groups directly affect electron affinities of PAG cations, as well as the efficiency of C-S bond cleavage reaction. Finally, the correlation between actual lithographic performance and calculated properties was carried out to understand the factors that influence efficiency of photoacid generation.", "Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion (KLE) is a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA) to random fields and random processes, providing optimal basis functions to represent random stochastic variability most accurately, ensuring the minimal mean square approximation error.

To better control stochastics related to chemical reactivity in CARs, our goal is to develop a model that correctly captures the rates of formation of products that can be experimentally measured in an ESCAP photoresist upon exposure to EUV light. We have previously reported the generation of a chemical reaction network that describes reactions likely to occur upon EUV exposure of a random copolymer of poly(hydroxystyrene) and poly(methylmethacrylate), triphenylsulfonium nonaflate, and triphenylsulfonium cyanobenzoate. Here, we detail the use of this network to create a reaction-diffusion model where photoionization, electron ionization, and electron attachment occur, as well as reactions between ions and species formed from photon- and electron-catalyzed processes. Results from this model can be directly compared to future experimental work conducted on ESCAP photoresists.", "", "", "Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography poses an ever greater challenge to RLS (resolution, line edge roughness, and sensitivity) than previous photolithography methods as lithographers try to achieve sub-14nm pitch in a single-exposure. Additionally, EUV is particularly susceptible to stochastic imaging defects. Although standard chemically amplified resists (CARs) can be exposed with EUV, these materials struggle to achieve resolution targets at manufacturable doses due to limitations in laser source power and resist sensitivity and contribute to stochastics by nature of their random distribution of components. An innovative approach with Inpria Metal Oxide Resists (MORs) can offer an alternative to overcome both EUV resolution and sensitivity limitations, as well as address stochastic defects. On the other hand, traditional sources of defectivity, such as particles, present another challenge, especially when moving toward high-volume manufacturing. Ultrahigh molecula r weight polyethylene (UPE) membrane filters have been used for metal oxide EUV resist filtration because of their high retention efficiency and excellent photochemical compatibility. However, newly designed UPE filters with innovative membrane morphology are needed to further lower defectivity rates with these new resists. This paper describes efforts to continue to improve metal oxide EUV resist defectivity through filtration optimization. A comparative study of the patterning performance of various Point-of-Use (POU) filters is presented. Several filters utilizing a variety of retention ratings and membrane designs were installed on a TEL Clean TrackTM Lithius ProTM Z series.

The demand for device scaling has produced more complex processes and expensive multiple-patterning requirements. Broad consensus on the direction of EUV technology has triggered the semiconductor industry to aggressively push new resist material development, particularly designed to overcome stochastic issues, which coincides with the establishment of the single-print capability infrastructure for the high numerical aperture (NA) EUV scanner. Although standard chemically amplified resists (CAR) have been struggling to overcome stochastic issues, they have improved significantly to demonstrate 24nm resolution with single exposure patterning using ASML\u2019s NXE3400B.

Novel photoresists continue to be designed to meet the simultaneous improvement of resolution, line width roughness, and sensitivity (RLS) trade-off. The absorption of EUV photons in the photoresist film leads to emission of primary electrons to form secondary electrons by inelastic scattering events which in turn leads to the activation of the photoacid generator compound. A unique challenge for the use of CAR in EUV lithography is their poor absorption at 13.5nm wavelength. Understanding the photoresist EUV absorption impact on lithographic performance parameters is critical for photoresist design. In this study, we designed photoresist polymers with tuned EUV absorption coefficients by incorporating EUV absorption group(s) onto different CAR polymers.

Simulation was used to early identify process failures and avoid via opens found on silicon, and to ensure process manufacturability. A full predictive virtual model was calibrated against silicon data to predict the complete process flow from the M2 module to the via module. A process sensitivity analysis was performed to simulate process variability impact on via resistance performance. The simulation identified process parameters and corresponding process windows that need to be controlled to avoid via opens and ensure process manufacturability.", "We performed a multi-step process optimization for high-aspect ratio etching using a Monte-Carlo based etching process simulation by solving the inverse problem. In this simulation, physical and empirical models are combined to provide a surface reaction model with response process knobs to achieve high accuracy within a short calculation time. We constructed a physical model for surface reactions which includes physical sputtering, chemical sputtering, radical deposition, surface modification by radicals, and thermal isotropic etching. We also updated the physical model to accommodate equipment parameters on the basis of experimental data. In this paper, we optimized 2-step recipe parameters including step time, low frequency RF power, O2 flow rate and C4F8 flow rate. This yielded conditions for achieving straighter profiles. Furthermore, we experimentally verified that one of the proposed recipes has a better profile than that of the baseline condition. We achieved a straighter profile by optimizing multiple parameters with different bottom vs. bow sensitivity and by appropriate multi-step control.", "We discuss the process integration to manufacture a spatial light modulator (SLM) device for application in mixed and augmented reality. The MEMS-part of the device is integrated on an external 180nm CMOS. The SLM consists of an 8MPixel micro mirror array with a pixel size of 4\u03bcm x 6\u03bcm. To provide the vertical strokes necessary for RGB color image generation, a comb-drive actuator concept was developed. Besides the yoke and the stator of the comb-drive, the actuator uses a double spring structure to reduce tilting of the mirror and other stress-induced effects. At the beginning of the product development we used iLine-lithography only, while later for the final device we switched to KrF-lithography to provide the necessary feature size down to 200nm as well as better CD-uniformity and overlay specification. We describe the process development, with focus on the lithography and etching processes for the actuator. Especially the different processes for patterning the Titanium-Aluminum structures of ultra-thin springs as well as the yoke and the stator with their high aspect ratios, which are specific for MEMS processing. Finally we achieved post-etch CD-uniformity <10nm per wafer for all metal structures as well on-product-overlay accuracy <15nm.", "Metalenses are flat devices that focus and manipulate optical waves. Unlike reflective and refractive optics, metalenses rely on phase shifts introduced by subwavelength metastructures. Demonstrate the cost and performance impact of using manufactured metaatoms from two lithography processes to design and manufacture metalenses. Design two types of metalenses, the first type (ideal) uses an ideal design made up of square metaatoms. This lens design is then simulated using both 193nm and 248nm lithography processes. The second type (manufacture-aware) uses a design that is built around metaatom profiles produced by the corresponding lithography process (193nm and 248nm respectively). By comparing the performance of these two approaches (ideal and manufacture-aware) we demonstrate the process performance impact can be reduced. Comparing 193nm and 248nm processes show a up to a 27% difference in monochromatic metalens performance for a design derived from ideal metaatoms. However, by simulating manufactured metaatoms and using them in the design stage, manufactured metalens performance returns to within 7% of ideal. When designing with manufactured metaatoms rather than ideal metaatoms, metalens performance is similar between both 193nm and 248nm processes and manufacture-aware design makes either process viable for visible-light metalens manufacturing.", "In a complementary FET (CFET), n- and p-type transistors are stacked on top of each other to enable device scaling. This stacking approach requires very high aspect ratio vertical feature pattering, namely, active gate, spacer source/drain cavity and contact patterning. We report contact trench patterning and plasma etch process development for contacting bottom and top transistors relevant to middle-of-line (MOL) integration in monolithic nanosheet based CFET. First, deep trenches (M0) with aspect ratio (AR) ~13 to 15 are etched into SiO2 dielectric layer between tall gates for routing bottom device. After the formation of bottom device, MOL contact patterning (M0T, AR ~8 to 9) for top device is performed. The main etch challenges are to preserve gate and gate spacer (SiN) and achieve good depth uniformity, especially when the M0 trench CD is reduced at tight pitches. At pitch 50nm, M0 etch development results are shown for four different etch processes (named as Etch Recipe 1 to 4) in which M0 etch depth is increased gradually targeting minimal SiN loss. To reduce gate spacer (SiN) loss, fluorocarbon plasma passivation and hydrocarbon polymer deposition step is used during M0 trench patterning.", "The wet etching of silicon (Si) is one of the most fundamental processes for the semiconductor industry. Although its etching kinetics on bulk Si surface have been thoroughly investigated, the kinetics of Si wet etching has yet to be fully addressed in nanoconfinements. Herein, we report the systematic study of potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet etching kinetics of amorphous-silicon(a-Si)-filled nanochannels. We discovered a nonlinear confinement dependence between the etching rate and the nanochannel dimension: the etching rate would increase with the increase in nanochannel height and then, gradually reaching a flat rate plateau. Our results provide new insights into the kinetic study of reactions in nanoconfinements and will shed light on etching process optimizations in industrial applications.", "Microchip downscaling has been one of the main drivers on the semiconductor industry to enable faster, more efficient, and compact microchips, greatly broadening their range of applications, like the Internet of Things, smart mobility, artificial intelligence and 5G, among others. Aside from transistor scaling, the Back End of Line (BEOL) interconnection network, which transfers power and signals from and into the transistors, must also be scaled down consequently. The scaling requirements have surpassed the maximum resolution achievable by any lithographic technique by solely relying on direct printing. In the case of low numerical aperture, Extreme UV (low NA EUV), the most advanced, commercially available lithography technology, printing line/space structures below pitch 30nm (P30) is extremely challenging. However, 3nm and newer nodes require BEOL line space structures with P26nm or narrower, in particular for the M2 layer. It is here where multipatterning techniques come into play. Self-Aligned multipatterning techniques allow to divide by a factor of two (double patterning, SADP), four (quadruple patterning, SAQP) or even eight (octuple patterning, SAOP) the pitch printed at lithography level, easing the lithography requirements. However, with multipatterning, there comes a risk that not all interconnect lines would be patterned with equal dimensions, which would introduce resistance and capacitance variations across lines that theoretically should be equivalent. Hence, all multipatterning techniques require a precise control of each of the fabrication steps to guarantee that all lines and spaces present the same dimensions, i.e., a balanced patterning with no pitch walking. The target of our work is to find the fabrication parameters that lead to the lowest pitch walking, roughness and defectivity conditions on EUV SADP patterning (eSADP) at P21nm structures with 10.5nm metal line Critical Dimension (CD). Thus, we carried out a set of experiments where the printed lithography line CD and the spacer thickness values are swept on 300mm silicon wafers. Then, we analyze the patterning performance at different stages of fabrication to see the evolution of line and space CDs, roughness and defectivity values to determine the best candidate for P2 nm eSADP patterning.", "The etch characteristics of Ir thin films were investigated in an inductively coupled plasma chamber, using a variety of chlorine gas chemistries, which included Cl2/Ar, Cl2/O2/Ar, and BCl3/Ar, as well as fluorine-based plasmas consisting of mixtures such as SF6/Ar, SF6/He, NF3/Ar, and CF4/O2. Under our experimental conditions, we found that the etch rates of Ir were considerably faster in fluorine-containing plasmas (~30nm/min) compared to chlorine-based mixtures (<15nm/min). The patterning of 100nm line/space features has been demonstrated using an organic mask. Although they show the fastest etching rates, SF6-based plasmas result in significant redeposition. In contrast, etching in CF4/O2 leads to etch profiles that are free of redeposition or residues. The poor selectivity of the mask over Ir under the different tested conditions results in shallow sidewall angles, hence highlighting the need for an alternative mask.", "The lateral gate-all-around (GAA) field effect transistor is considered to be the most promising candidate for the next generation of logic devices at the 3nm technology node and beyond. SiGe plays an important role as a sacrificial layer in the GAA device, which requires isotropic etching, and the quality of the etching has a critical impact on the device performance. However, there is no definite scheme in the industry for the choice of etching method. In this paper, we choose two etching methods: CP(Inductively coupled Plasma) and RPS (Remote Plasma Source) etching according to the presence or absence of particle incidence. The profile and etching effect of the two etching methods are analyzed by PEGASUS simulation software. The presence or absence of particle incidence has different effects on the damage of the structure, the inconsistency of etching amount and the reflection of the particles on the Si surface. Compared with ICP etching, the optimization of RPS etching on etching damage and etch amount consistency is verified by TEM and roughness characterization . And through the extraction of MOSCAP capacitance, it is found that the density of interface states(Dit) after ICP etching is 3.5 times higher than that of RPS etching.", "Self-aligned double patterning scheme is the dominant technique which is widely adopted in semiconductor industry to achieve finer patterns before extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography volume production is available. The critical dimension (CD) for the key structures fabricated from SADP flow, normally referred to as Bitline (BL) or Wordline (WL), is crucial to enable the microcircuitry to operate properly.

In this presentation, two different types of simulations illustrating the power of kinetic modeling are demonstrated. The first is a macroscopic-scale simulation of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP). We demonstrate how implicit methods can make these challenging simulations feasible, and show that our numerical model captures salient physical effects (inductive coupling, sheath formation, plasma generation, etc.) of the ICP discharge. Efforts to hasten the convergence of these simulations to steady-state and to improve their predictive capabilities are also summarized. Secondly, we outline ongoing work to develop microscopic feature-scale simulations of a through-silicon-via etch process, obtaining potential boundary conditions and incident particle fluxes within the feature from larger-scale kinetic sheath computations. For both simulation types, ion energy-angle distributions at the wafer surface, electron kinetics, and the detailed physics of the sheath and presheath can be computed by our numerical model.", "Thermal Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) has received attention in recent years as an emerging semiconductor fabrication technique, as the device dimensions are scaling down to only a few nm. Thermal ALE has the ability to etch material isotropically, which is especially useful for high aspect ratio features. Copper ALE is of considerable interest since Cu is still the metal of choice for interconnects. In order to etch a Cu thin film conformally, the first step (surface oxidation) needs to be carefully controlled. Currently used oxidants, like ozone, hydrogen peroxide or oxygen plasma tend to damage the copper surface and oxidize it up to a few nm deep. These are undesirable outcomes for ALE, because the surface should remain as uniform as possible post oxidation, so that the etch step yields a smooth and conformal Cu surface. Therefore, there is a need for more tunable oxidants which allow for better control of the oxidation strength and depth of Cu thin films. In this paper, we report new, mild oxidants for Cu ALE. The oxidation strength of these reagents has been probed by in-situ x-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and one of them has been tested in real ALE conditions together with a known etch ligand (hexafluoroacetylaceton) and probed by in-situ QCM.", "The synthesis, spectroscopic properties, and suitability for use as precursors in atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes are described for the ZrCp3 and HfCp3. ZrCp3 was prepared by a literature procedure entailing reduction of ZrCp4 with potassium graphite and was isolated as brown crystals in 34% yield. HfCp4 was isolated in 57% yield as yellow-brown crystals by a similar route employing reduction of HfCp4 with potassium graphite. ZrCp3 and HfCp3 showed broad paramagnetic resonances in the 1H NMR spectra that were centered at \u03b4 6.2 and 6.0ppm, respectively, which are assigned to the cyclopentadienyl hydrogen atoms. Additionally, the 1H NMR spectra of the ZrCp3 and HfCp3 crystals revealed resonances arising from the diamagnetic complexes Cp3ZrH and Cp3HfH, which are proposed to arise from hydrolysis of ZrCp3 and HfCp3 by traces of water in the NMR solvent. The identities of ZrCp3 and HfCp3 were established by determination of their x-ray crystal structures, which exactly matched previously reported molecular structures. Thermogravimetric analyses of ZrCp3 and HfCp3 were conducted to assess their volatilities and thermal stabilities. ZrCp3 showed the onset of mass loss at about 125 \u00b0C and revealed a single-step evaporation up to about 225 \u00b0C, at which point decomposition limited further mass loss. Mass loss for HfCp3 started at about 150 \u00b0C and continued up to about 270 \u00b0C, at which point decomposition limited further mass loss. ZrCp3 and HfCp3 decomposed extensively during preparative sublimation experiments at 0.5 Torr, and do not appear to have promising properties as ALD precursors.", "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS have faced increased scrutiny because they are environmentally persistent and certain PFAS have also been found to be bioaccumulative and toxic. In recent years, PFAS chemistries have been grouped as a class based on chemical structure rather than physical and chemical properties or environmental and human health considerations. This class definition has brought into scope many fluorocarbons found in semiconductor manufacturing, including the fluoropolymers used to ensure safe handling and distribution of chemicals and gases, as well as perfluorocarbon (PFC) and hydrocarbon (HFC) gases used in plasma etch processes. This paper will present a historical perspective of the semiconductor industry\u2019s efforts to reduce F-GHG consumption and emissions. It will conclude with an overview of the work of the Semiconductor PFAS Consortium and their plasma etch and deposition working group.", "Over the past few years, numerous countries and semiconductor manufacturing entities have unveiled their commitments to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or even sooner. When it comes to manufacturing chips, plasma etch processes contribute significantly to emissions, especially in dielectric etching. These processes typically involve the use of high global warming potential (GWP) fluorocarbon gasses like CHF3, CF4, and CH2F2. Air Liquide's research and development (R&D) endeavors have led to the creation of multiple alternative etch chemistries for SiN and SiO2 etching applications that boast remarkably low GWPs. Despite strides in developing these alternative chemistries, accurately forecasting the gases emitted post-plasma remains elusive. The complexities inherent in the breakdown and recombination processes within the plasma make it challenging to predict the specific emissions, regardless of whether the gas introduced into the plasma etch chamber carries a high or low GWP. This research showcases the utilization of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to analyze and measure the emission gas stream from the plasma etch chamber.

Especially, the use of perfluorocarbons (PFC) during the dry etching and deposit steps of device manufacturing is a major concern because of the extremely high global warming potential (GWP) and lifetime of most of those compounds. Consequently, plasma etching significantly contributes to CO2 emissions for sub-28nm technologies on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Currently, CEA-Leti is developing a 10nm node on FDSOI (Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator) technology. In this framework, we present Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of etching processes for FDSOI transistor technologies.

These challenges are coming together with additional requirements for sustainable, low Global Warming Potential/ low toxicity /low fine particle emissions. As a result, new solutions in terms of process integrations, molecules used for patterning modules, and overall stack of materials will have to meet those requirements while staying compatible with high-volume manufacturing (cost, availability, throughput, and overall patterning performance). Although specific process steps such as capacitor patterning for DRAM or 3D NAND high aspect ratio oxide etch are heavily scrutinized steps in terms of emissions and patterning challenges, many applications, including logic, integrate hundreds of steps where the patterning of 10 to 30nm-thick layers requiring fluorine-containing gases. Although independently accounting for a modest amount of emissions, their sheer counts makes them a major contributor to CO2 equivalent emissions.

This process combines many individual steps from a standard damascene double patterning flow with a spacer pull process to adapt it for subtractive patterning. Requiring two EUV exposures, this process flow enables a broad design space comparable to existing SALELE solutions for damascene integrations. Utilizing this process flow, we have demonstrated successful patterning of complex designs including intertwined comb-serpentines and various mixed pitch patterns. We report matched resistance for both mandrel and non-mandrel resistors. Additionally, we demonstrate equivalent yields for 1mm long intertwined comb-serpentine structures with serpentines formed from both mandrel and non-mandrel patterns.", "In this paper, we first present a brief review of the advanced-node logic device technology development and its key bottleneck/component processes using the existing lithographic capabilities. It is shown to be feasible to evolve into the GAA era with the minimum change of current FinFET process and a minor refining of previously reported Forksheet structure. The concept of hybrid-channel devices is raised which is not only promising for 3D vertical integration, but also offers an optimal tradeoff between device performance and power/leakage. To address the fabrication challenges, a mandrel/spacer engineering based patterning and metallization technology is proposed and its process development results are reported. This patterning & metallization technique can be applied to fabricate advanced logic and SRAM circuits with significantly enhanced pattern density. It is based on the self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP) wherein either an alternating arrangement of different materials (with high etching selectivity) or multi-color layer decomposition (i.e., splitting of metallization process) is utilized to solve the edge-placement-error (EPE) issue. In particular, we explore various schemes of self-aligned triple patterning (SATP) to identify the potential solution to ensure a satisfactory profile control of the consecutively formed spacers. Moreover, this technique can incorporate rigorously self-aligned vias & cuts (SAVC), and accommodate a metal-layer division (MLD) to split the neighboring metal lines into two vertically staggered layers with their coupling capacitance significantly reduced. The tested metal Ru allows a direct dry etching, which offers a metal recess capability to enable an alternating-material coverage of neighboring metal wires by two different hard masks such that a selective etching can be applied to form rigorously self-aligned vias. Our early-stage process development is focused on SATP process optimization, fabrication of two simplified grating structures, material screening for appropriate etching selectivity, and metal-layer-division realization. Potential processing challenges such as Ru trench-filling quality and scaling issues of SAVC technology for advanced IC manufacturing will also be discussed.", "In semiconductor manufacturing, the selective removal of the carbon mask after etching has become increasingly challenging with the introduction of Gate-All-Around (GAA) technologies. This transition has brought greater procedural complexity, necessitating more process steps to accommodate intricate and vertically structured designs. Consequently, there arises a need to reassess the appropriateness of traditional methods. Traditionally, the process relied on high RF power plasma to eliminate the carbon mask, resulting in the generation of large quantities of ions that could potentially compromise the integrity of thin film materials. As materials refine and designs require increased vertical scaling, associated risk factors are accentuated. Over-cleaning leads to ion damage, exemplifying the limitations in enhancing device performance. To overcome these challenges, an innovative selective mask removal (SMR) technology has been developed using Metastable Activated Radical Source (MARS). Utilizing MARS, radicals derived from hydrogen or oxygen exhibit lower energy levels, minimizing material damage on the wafer surface during the SMR process. This revolutionary technique significantly reduces the thickness of native oxide layers after SMR, lessening electrical resistance in critical processing steps and enhancing device performance. Furthermore, it enables improved surface passivation strategies, preventing the formation of native oxide and enabling multivalent passivation. These advancements mark a significant step in reducing pattern-induced damage in the GAA era, aligning with sustained progression in line with Moore's Law.", "Nanosheet device architectures such as complementary FET (CFET) are candidates to replace FinFET, improving device performance while allowing a higher density of devices for a similar footprint. Two main challenges can be highlighted in the definition of the active area (AA) patterning for CFET. First the presence of stacked nanosheets generates the need for a higher aspect-ratio compared to FinFET. Secondly, the nanosheets layers, composed of silicon and silicon-germanium with varied thicknesses and concentrations, require new approaches in terms of process definition and control. The first results of an active area patterning for a full CFET device have been demonstrated at imec. Thicker nanosheet stacks are patterned opening the path to the creation of a complete CFET device.", "In conventional gate-all-around FET architecture, p-type and n-type devices are stacked on top of each other on separate devices. In Complementary FET (CFET) architecture, n-MOS and p-MOS devices are stacked in the same device on top of each other. This allows for reduction in footprint and power consumption. One of the most high aspect ratio (HAR) patterning in CFET processing comes from patterning of the gate spacer, followed by nanosheet (NSH) patterning. The HAR Spacer Source/Drain cavity area is a Si/SiGe/Dielectric superlattices bringing quite a few patterning challenges. This work discusses the challenges for the spacer opening, optimization of the profile of the source drain (SD) cavity and strategies to improve selectivity with the gate hard mask (HM). The first patterning challenge includes etching of a superlattice consisting of numerous materials, including dielectrics, while maintaining selectivity to HM. This means switching of chemistries to accommodate the patterning of these multilayers. Secondly, this patterning step needs to be highly selective to the gate HM to allow enough margin for downstream processes. The patterning step also needs to deliver vertical cavity profile. All these challenges require us to explore complex etch processes including in-situ isolation, passivation, and other etching sequences. The results and challenges for a fully patterned spacer & SD cavity as demonstrated at Imec are presented in this proceeding.", "This paper presents a new patterning scheme that allows self-alignment of active area contacts at different z-elevations. This patterning approach can be used for various types of 3D logic and memory devices. From an incoming structure using a stack of materials with different etch selectivity, some local metal braces are first introduced at certain targeted elevations and provide a first level of contact to active device materials. The brace formations require diverse etch selectivity for the selected dielectric materials, ultra-conformal metal deposition techniques for use on buried/covered structures, and anisotropic metal etching steps. A second level of contact is then made to access those braces by using via and cavity etches followed by metal fill. This multi-level contact patterning technique is further described in this paper by first using a generic example, and then by looking at two specific applications for logic and memory, with new CFET and staircase contacting schemes, respectively."], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
