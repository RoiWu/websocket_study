In constructing 3D NAND flash memories, the higher bit number per area is achieved by increasing the number of stacked layers. Thus the so-called \u201cstaircase\u201d patterning to form electrical connection between memory cells and word lines has become one of the primarily critical processes in 3D memory manufacture. To provide controllable critical dimension (CD) with good uniformity involving thick photo-resist has also been of particular concern for staircase patterning. The CD uniformity control has been widely investigated with relatively thinner resist associated with resolution limit dimension but thick resist coupling with wider dimension. This study explores CD uniformity control associated with thick photo-resist processing. Several critical parameters including exposure focus, exposure dose, baking condition, pattern size and development recipe, were found to strongly correlate with the thick photo-resist profile accordingly affecting the CD uniformity control. To minimize the within-wafer CD variation, the slightly tapered resist profile is proposed through well tailoring the exposure focus and dose together with optimal development recipe. Great improvements on DCD (ADI CD) and ECD (AEI CD) uniformity as well as line edge roughness were achieved through the optimization of photo resist profile.", "As the demand of the technology node shrinks from 14nm to 7nm, the reliability of tool monitoring techniques in advanced semiconductor fabs to achieve high yield and quality becomes more critical. Tool health monitoring methods involve periodic sampling of moderately processed test wafers to detect for particles, defects, and tool stability in order to ensure proper tool health. For lithography TWINSCAN scanner tools, the requirements for overlay stability and focus control are very strict. Current scanner tool health monitoring methods include running BaseLiner to ensure proper tool stability on a periodic basis. The focus measurement on YIELDSTAR by real-time or library-based reconstruction of critical dimensions (CD) and side wall angle (SWA) has been demonstrated as an accurate metrology input to the control loop. The high accuracy and repeatability of the YIELDSTAR focus measurement provides a common reference of scanner setup and user process. In order to further improve the metrology and matching performance, Diffraction Based Focus (DBF) metrology enabling accurate, fast, and non-destructive focus acquisition, has been successfully utilized for focus monitoring/control of TWINSCAN NXT immersion scanners. The optimal DBF target was determined to have minimized dose crosstalk, dynamic precision, set-get residual, and lens aberration sensitivity. By exploiting this new measurement target design, ~80% improvement in tool-to-tool matching, >16% improvement in run-to-run mean focus stability, and >32% improvement in focus uniformity have been demonstrated compared to the previous BaseLiner methodology. Matching <2.4 nm across multiple NXT immersion scanners has been achieved with the new methodology of set baseline reference. This baseline technique, with either conventional BaseLiner low numerical aperture (NA=1.20) mode or advanced illumination high NA mode (NA=1.35), has also been evaluated to have consistent performance. This enhanced methodology of focus control and monitoring on multiple illumination conditions, opens an avenue to significantly reduce Focus-Exposure Matrix (FEM) wafer exposure for new product/layer best focus (BF) setup.", "With the latest immersion scanners performing at the sub-2 nm overlay level, the non-lithography contributors to the OnProduct-Overlay budget become more and more dominant. Examples of these contributors are etching, thin film deposition, Chemical-Mechanical Planarization and thermal anneal. These processes can introduce stress or stress changes in the thin films on top of the silicon wafers, resulting in significant wafer grid distortions. High-order wafer alignment (HOWA) is the current ASML solution for correcting wafers with a high order grid distortion introduced by non-lithographic processes, especially when these distortions vary from wafer-to-wafer. These models are currently successfully applied in high volume production at several semiconductor device manufacturers. An important precondition is that the wafer distortions remain global as the polynomial-based HOWA models become less effective for very local distortions. Wafer-shape based feed forward overlay corrections can be a possible solution to overcome this challenge. Thin film stress typically has an impact on the unclamped, free-form shape of the wafers. When an accurate relationship between the wafer shape and in-plane distortion (IPD) after clamping is established then feedforward overlay control can be enabled. In this work we assess the capability of wafer-shape based IPD predictions via a controlled experiment. The processinduced IPDs are accurately measured on the ASML TWINSCANTM system using its SMASH alignment system and the wafer shapes are measured on the Superfast 4G inspection system. In order to relate the wafer shape to the IPD we have developed a prediction model beyond the standard Stoney approximation. The match between the predicted and measured IPD is excellent (~1-nm), indicating the feasibility of using wafer shape for feed-forward overlay control.", "Multi-patterning processes have become common in the leading-edge semiconductor industry. These processes require a good patterning uniformity over the wafer while different process steps have impact. The initial lithography steps can be nearly perfect, but the CD variation after a trim process may cause CD variation after the spacer deposition. In fact, that leads to final non-uniformity of the final CD. Monitoring and controlling the individual CD parameters is not sufficient to ensure a stable process. We define a set of new KPIs, taking all contributions into account and using macro measurement data. We show that a reliable monitoring is achieved to meet the process specifications.", "This paper has developed the multi-beam laser interference lithography (LIL) system for nano/micro pattern sapphire substrate process (PSS/NPSS). However, the multi-beam LIL system is very sensitive to the light source and the vibration. When there is a vibration source in the exposure environment, the standing wave distribution on the substrate will be affected by the vibration and move in a certain angle. As a result, Moir\u00e9 fringe defects occur on the exposure result. In order to eliminate the effect of the vibration, we use the software ANSYS to analyze the resonant frequencies of our multi-beam LIL system. Therefore, we need to design new multi-beam LIL system to raise the value of resonant frequencies. The new design of the multi-beam LIL system has higher resonant frequencies and successfully eliminates the bending and rotating effect of the resonant frequencies. As a result, the new multi-beam LIL system can fabricate large area and defects free period structures.", "Mask inspection is a critical step in the mask manufacturing process in order to ensure all dimensions printed are within the needed tolerances. This becomes even more challenging as the device nodes shrink and the complexity of the tapeout increases. Thus, the amount of measurement points and their critical dimension (CD) types are increasing to ensure the quality of the mask. In addition to the mask quality, there is a significant amount of manpower needed when the preparation and debugging of this process are not automated. By utilizing a novel pattern search technology with the ability to measure and report match region scan-line (edge) measurements, we can create a flow to find, measure and mark all metrology locations of interest and provide this automated report to the mask shop for inspection. A digital library is created based on the technology product and node which contains the test patterns to be measured. This paper will discuss how these digital libraries will be generated and then utilized. As a time-critical part of the manufacturing process, this can also reduce the data preparation cycle time, minimize the amount of manual/human error in naming and measuring the various locations, reduce the risk of wrong/missing CD locations, and reduce the amount of manpower needed overall. We will also review an example pattern and how the reporting structure to the mask shop can be processed. This entire process can now be fully automated.", "Self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) processes have found widespread acceptance in advanced technology nodes to drive device scaling beyond the resolution limitations of immersion scanners. Of the four spaces generated in this process from one lithography pattern two tend to be equivalent as they are derived from the first spacer deposition. The three independent spaces are commonly labelled as \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3. \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are controlled by multiple process steps including the initial lithographic patterning process, the two mandrel and spacer etches as well as the two spacer depositions. Scatterometry has been the preferred metrology approach, however is restricted to repetitive arrays. In these arrays independent measurements, in particular of alpha and gamma, are not possible due to degeneracy of the standard array targets. . In this work we present a single target approach which lifts the degeneracies commonly encountered while using product relevant layout geometries. We will first describe the metrology approach which includes the previously described SRM (signal response metrology) combined with reference data derived from CD SEM data. The performance of the methodology is shown in figures 1-3. In these figures the optically determined values for alpha, beta and gamma are compared to the CD SEM reference data. The variations are achieved using controlled process experiments varying Mandrel CD and Spacer deposition thicknesses.", "The application of Moir\u00e9 effect for testing of a lithographic projection lens is reported. The arrangement presented allows measuring magnification, distortion, field curvature and telecentricity of the lens and can be used for its fine tuning. The method is based on two matched two-dimensional gratings, positioned in mutually conjugated planes; one of them can be translated. Visual interpretation of Moir\u00e9 fringe pattern allows quick diagnostics of position errors exceeding critical dimension, whereas lateral scanning is applied for measuring of smaller magnitude errors. Field curvature and telecentricity are measured by 3D scanning. Presented results are in a good agreement with those obtained elsewhere.", "As semiconductor manufacturing continues its march towards more advanced technology nodes, it becomes increasingly important to identify and characterize design weak points, which is typically done using a combination of inline inspection data and the physical layout (or design). However, the employed methodologies have been somewhat imprecise, relying greatly on statistical techniques to signal excursions. For example, defect location error that is inherent to inspection tools prevents them from reporting the true locations of defects. Therefore, common operations such as background-based binning that are designed to identify frequently failing patterns cannot reliably identify specific weak patterns. They can only identify an approximate set of possible weak patterns, but within these sets there are many perfectly good patterns. Additionally, characterizing the failure rate of a known weak pattern based on inline inspection data also has a lot of fuzziness due to coordinate uncertainty. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) Review attempts to come to the rescue by capturing high resolution images of the regions surrounding the reported defect locations, but SEM images are reviewed by human operators and the weak patterns revealed in those images must be manually identified and classified. Compounding the problem is the fact that a single Review SEM image may contain multiple defective patterns and several of those patterns might not appear defective to the human eye.\nIn this paper we describe a significantly improved methodology that brings advanced computer image processing and design-overlay techniques to better address the challenges posed by today\u2019s leading technology nodes. Specifically, new software techniques allow the computer to analyze Review SEM images in detail, to overlay those images with reference design to detect every defect that might be present in all regions of interest within the overlaid reference design (including several classes of defects that human operators will typically miss), to obtain the exact defect location on design, to compare all defective patterns thus detected against a library of known patterns, and to classify all defective patterns as either new or known. By applying the computer to these tasks, we automate the entire process from defective pattern identification to pattern classification with high precision, and we perform this operation en masse during R & D, ramp, and volume production.\nBy adopting the methodology, whenever a specific weak pattern is identified, we are able to run a series of characterization operations to ultimately arrive at the root cause. These characterization operations can include (a) searching all pre-existing Review SEM images for the presence of the specific weak pattern to determine whether there is any spatial (within die or within wafer) or temporal (within any particular date range, before or after a mask revision, etc.) correlation and (b) understanding the failure rate of the specific weak pattern to prioritize the urgency of the problem, (c) comparing the weak pattern against an OPC (Optical Procimity Correction) Verification report or a PWQ (Process Window Qualification)/FEM (Focus Exposure Matrix) result to assess the likelihood of it being a litho-sensitive pattern, etc. After resolving the specific weak pattern, we will categorize it as known pattern, and the engineer will move forward with discovering new weak patterns.", "A numeric model is proposed describing the chemical and physical mechanisms governing image formation in metaloxide (MOx) EUV photoresist systems. Experimental measurements of physical and chemical properties are used to develop a quantitative representation of the chemical and physical state of the MOx resist film at each step in the lithographic process. The role of radiation-induced condensation to drive non-linear changes in development rate is elucidated. Lithographic performance parameters are predicted and compared with experimental results.", "the microelectronics industry. Traditional EUV photoresists have been composed of organic compounds which are moderately transparent to EUV. Resist stochastics and sensitivity can be improved by increasing the number of photons absorbed. Molecular organometallic resists are a type of metal containing resist aimed at improving EUV absorption. This work focuses on studying the role of the metal center (Metal = Co, Fe, Cr) in an oxalate complex by comparing the number of absorbed photons and the photoelectron reactivity in each compound. In the study presented here, the EUV absorption coefficients are determined experimentally by measuring the transmission through a resist coated on a silicon nitride membrane using an Energetiq EQ-10M xenon plasma EUV source. Additionally, the photochemistry is evaluated by monitoring outgassing reaction products. This particular resist platform eliminates oxalate ligands when exposed to electrons or EUV photons resulting in a solubility difference between the exposed and unexposed regions. In the process, carbon dioxide is produced and is monitored using mass spectrometry, where quantitative values are obtained using a calibration technique. For the metal oxalate complexes studied, the absorption of EUV changed minimally due to the low concentrations of metal atoms. However, EUV and electron reactivity greatly changed between the three compounds likely due to the reducibility of the metal center. A correlation is shown between Esize and the reducibility of each photoresist.", "Several metal-containing molecular inorganic materials are currently considered as photoresists for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). This is primarily due to their high EUV absorption cross section and small building block size, properties which potentially allow both high sensitivity and resolution as well as low line-edge roughness. The photochemical reaction mechanisms that allow these kinds of materials to function as photoresists, however, are still poorly understood. As a step in this direction, we here discuss photochemical reactions upon deep UV (DUV) irradiation of a model negative-tone EUV photoresist material, namely the well-defined molecular tin-oxo cage compound [(SnR)12O14(OH)6]X2 (R = organic group; X = anion) which is spin coated to thin layers of 20 nm. The core electronic structure (Sn 3d, O 1s and C 1s) of fresh and DUV exposed films were then investigated using synchrotron radiationbased hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). This method provides information about the structure and chemical state of the respective atoms in the material. We performed a comparative HAXPES study of the composition of the tin-oxo cage compound [(SnR)12O14(OH)6](OH)2, either fresh directly after spin-coated vs. DUV-exposed materials under either ambient condition or under a dry N2 atmosphere. Different chemical oxidation states and concentrations of atoms and atom types in the fresh and exposed films were found. We further found that the chemistry resulting from exposure in air and N2 is strikingly different, clearly illustrating the influence of film-gas interactions on the (photo)chemical processes that eventually determine the photoresist. Finally, a mechanistic hypothesis for the basic DUV photoreactions in molecular tin-oxo cages is proposed.", "High resolution Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) patterning is currently limited by EUV resist thickness and pattern collapse, thus impacting the faithful image transfer into the underlying stack. Such limitation requires the investigation of improved hardmasks (HMs) as etch transfer layers for EUV patterning. Ultrathin (<5nm) inorganic HMs can provide higher etch selectivity, lower post-etch LWR, decreased defectivity and wet strippability compared to spin-on hybrid HMs (e.g., SiARC), however such novel layers can induce resist adhesion failure and resist residue. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of EUV resist-inorganic HM interactions is needed in order to optimize the EUV resist interfacial behavior. In this paper, novel materials and processing techniques are introduced to characterize and improve the EUV resist-inorganic HM interface. HM surface interactions with specific EUV resist components are evaluated for open-source experimental resist formulations dissected into its individual additives using EUV contrast curves as an effective characterization method to determine post-development residue formation. Separately, an alternative adhesion promoter platform specifically tailored for a selected ultrathin inorganic HM based on amorphous silicon (aSi) is presented and the mitigation of resist delamination is exemplified for the cases of positive-tone and negative-tone development (PTD, NTD). Additionally, original wafer priming hardware for the deposition of such novel adhesion promoters is unveiled. The lessons learned in this work can be directly applied to the engineering of EUV resist materials and processes specifically designed to work on such novel HMs.", "Abstract BACKGROUND: The ionizing wavelength in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resist exposure leads to photoelectron scattering and uncertainty in the resulting acid image, producing line-edge roughness (LER) and poor CD uniformity of the printed features. GOALS: Try to determine how photoelectron and acid exposure blur effects affect EUV lithography and how they might be better controlled. Try to determine whether or not, and if so under what conditions, high resist quantum yields are beneficial to EUV lithography. METHODS: Using a stochastic resist simulator, we study the effects of resist properties upon photoelectric scattering, the uncertainty in the acid release and the properties of the after-development photoresist image in high NA EUV lithography. Uncertainty in the release of acids is the fundamental cause of LER and the ultimate limiter of optical lithography technology.", "Alternative photoresist platforms are being developed with the goal of meeting Resolution, Roughness and Sensitivity requirements for EUV lithography. Metal-based materials appear promising due to the high etch resistance, high absorption, and high resolution. However, the exposure mechanism of these materials is quite different from that of organic chemically amplified resists. The current electron-scattering model built into PROLITHTM X6.0 allows a direct comparison of the exposure mechanisms for different resist platforms: in particular, it is now possible to estimate the intrinsic resist uncertainty by evaluating electron, acid shot noise and spatial blurring, while forcing the photon shot noise contribution to zero. A comparison between organic resists and metal-based platforms reveals how the denser nature of the latter help containing the electron scattering in a much closer radius around the absorption event. The consequent electron-reaction (acid generation for photo-active-generator-containing organic materials, ligand dissociation for the metal-oxides) reflects the electron shot noise of the different platforms. The higher absorption combined with lower blur of the metaloxide materials seem to become of crucial importance for the 5 nm technology node and beyond.", "Pattern fidelity of EUV lithography is crucial for high resolution features, since small variation can affect device performance and even cause short or open circuit. For 1D features, dense lines and contact holes are the most common features for active, metal and contact layer, therefore line width roughness (LWR) and local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) are important indexes to monitor. Both LWR and LCDU are greatly influenced by photon and acid shot noise. In addition, LWR is also affected by resist mechanical properties, like pattern collapse. In this study, we studied the influence of different chemically amplified resist components, such as polymer, PAG and quencher for both types and concentrations in order to understand the relative extent of influences of deprotection, acid diffusion, and base neutralization on pattern fidelity. However, conventional methods to approach higher resolution or low LWR/LCDU by sacrificing the dose are not sustainable. In order to continue to improve resist performance, a new component, metal salt sensitizer, is introduced into the resist system. This metal salt is able to achieve 30% dose reduction by increasing EUV absorption, maintaining LWR. We believe metal sensitizer might give us a new way to challenge the RLS trade-off.", "Minimization and control of line-edge roughness (LER) and contact-edge roughness (CER) is one of the current challenges limiting EUV line-space and contact hole printability. One significant contributor to feature roughness and CD variability in EUV is photon shot noise (PSN); others are the physical and chemical processes in photoresists, known as resist stochastic effect. Different approaches are available to mitigate each of these contributions. In order to facilitate this mitigation, it is important to assess the magnitude of each of these contributions separately from others. In this paper, we present and test a computational approach based on the concept of an \u2018ideal resist\u2019. An ideal resist is assumed to be devoid of all resist stochastic effects. Hence, such an ideal resist can only be simulated as an \u2018ideal resist model\u2019 (IRM) through explicit utilization of the Poisson statistics of PSN2 or direct Monte Carlo simulation of photon absorption in resist. LER estimated using IRM, thus quantifies the exclusive contribution of PSN to LER. The result of the simulation study done using IRM indicates higher magnitude of contribution (60%) from PSN to LER with respect to total or final LER for a sufficiently optimized high dose \u2018state of the art\u2019 EUV chemically amplified resist (CAR) model.", "This work focuses on the application of a high-speed atomic force microscope (HS-AFM) for the in situ observation / quantification of the resist dissolution process. Specifically, this paper discusses on the existence of what the authors refer to as \u201cnano-swelling\u201d which occurs in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) exposed areas of a positive-tone chemically amplified resist, just before it dissolves into the aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) developer solution. In earlier experiments using typical EUVL resist materials (e.g. polyhydroxystyrene (PHS) polymer and hybrid PHS-methacryl polymer model resists), it was understood that nano-swelling is mainly material type-dependent. As shown in the investigations/results in this paper, nano-swelling has variations in the timing of occurrence and amount/size depending on the size of the dissolvable areas (i.e. larger dissolvable areas dissolve faster, swell more compared to smaller ones). Lastly, a comparison of surface analyses results of a resist pattern before, during, and after the occurrence of nano-swelling suggests the significant impact of these kinds of non-uniformities in the formation of line edge/line width roughness (LER/LWR).", "Out of band (OOB) radiation from the EUV source has significant implications for the performance of EUVL photoresists. Here we introduce a surface-active polymer additive, capable of partitioning to the top of the resist film during casting and annealing, to protect the underlying photoresist from OOB radiation. Copolymers were prepared using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, and rendered surface active by chain extension with a block of fluoro-monomer. Films were prepared from the EUV resist with added surface-active Embedded Barrier Layer (EBL), and characterized using measurements of contact angles and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Finally, the lithographic performance of the resist containing the EBL was evaluated using Electron Beam Lithography exposure", "The main challenge in ArF lithography is to reduce cost of ownership (CoO) because increase in multi-patterning process is generally required to obtain a fine pattern. As a consequence, industry strongly requires ArF lithography process with a fast scan speed scanner and low defectivity material for CoO. The breakthrough technology to improve defectivity and resolution simultaneously was the polarity-change property of film surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic after alkaline development process because a property after development process should be only associated with defectivity, not fast scan speed. The materials with high polarity change function were explored to EUV process to achieve low defectivity with good lithography performances.", "A new type of Photosensitized Chemically Amplified Resist (PSCAR) **: \u201cPSCAR 2.0,\u201d is introduced in this paper. PSCAR 2.0 is composed of a protected polymer, a \u201cphoto acid generator which can be photosensitized\u201d (PS-PAG), a \u201cphoto decomposable base (quencher) which can be photosensitized\u201d (PS-PDB) and a photosensitizer precursor (PP). With this PSCAR 2.0, a photosensitizer (PS) is generated by an extreme ultra-violet (EUV) pattern exposure. Then, during a subsequent flood exposure, PS selectively photosensitizes the EUV exposed areas by the decomposition of a PS-PDB in addition to the decomposition of PS-PAG. As these pattern-exposed areas have the additional acid and reduced quencher concentration, the initial quencher loading in PSCAR 2.0 can be increased in order to get the same target critical dimensions (CD). The quencher loading is to be optimized simultaneously with a UV flood exposure dose to achieve the best lithographic performance and resolution. In this work, the PSCAR performance when different quenchers are used is examined by simulation and exposure experiments with the 16 nm half-pitch (HP) line/space (L/S, 1:1) patterns. According to our simulation results among resists with the different quencher types, the best performance was achieved by PSCAR 2.0 using PS-PDB with the highest possible chemical gradient resulting in the lowest line width roughness (LWR). PSCAR 2.0 performance has furthermore been confirmed on ASML\u2019s NXE:3300 with TEL\u2019s standalone pre-alpha flood exposure tool at imec. The initial PSCAR 2.0 patterning results on NXE:3300 showed the accelerated photosensitization performance with PS-PDB. From these results, we concluded that the dual sensitization of PS-PAG and PS-PDB in PSCAR 2.0 have a potential to realize a significantly improved resist performance in EUV lithography.", "The synthesis and lithographic evaluation of 193-nm and EUV photoresists that utilize a higher-order reaction mechanism of deprotection is presented. Unique polymers utilize novel blocking groups that require two acid-catalyzed steps to be removed. When these steps occur with comparable reaction rates, the overall reaction can be higher order (\u2264 1.85). The LWR of these resists is plotted against PEB time for a variety of compounds to acquire insight into the effectiveness of the proposed higher-order mechanisms. Evidence acquired during testing of these novel photoresist materials supports the conclusion that higher-order reaction kinetics leads to improved LWR vs. control resists.", "Inpria metal-oxide photoresist (PR) serves as a thin spin-on patternable hard mask for EUV lithography. Compared to traditional organic photoresists, the ultrathin metal-oxide photoresist (~12nm after development) effectively mitigates pattern collapse. Because of the high etch resistance of the metal-oxide resist, this may open up significant scope for more aggressive etches, new chemistries, and novel integration schemes. We have previously shown that metal-oxide PR can be successfully used to pattern the block layer for the imec 7-nm technology node[1] and advantageously replace a multiple patterning approach, which significantly reduces the process complexity and effectively decreases the cost. We also demonstrated the formation of 16nm half pitch 1:1 line/space with EUV single print[2], which corresponds to a metal 2 layer for the imec 7-nm technology node. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using Inpria\u2019s metal-oxide PR for 16nm line/space patterning. In meanwhile, we also explore the different etch process for LWR smoothing, resist trimming and resist stripping.", "Successful pattern transfer from the photoresist into the substrate depends on robust layers of lithographic films. Typically, an alternating sequence of inorganic (most often Si containing) and organic hardmask (HM) materials is used. Pattern transfer occurs then by using reactive ion etch (RIE) chemistry that is selective to one particular layer (such as: flurorinated RIE for Si HM). The impact of these RIE gases onto the layers acting as hardmask for the layer to be etched is typically neglected, except for known sputtering effects. We found that components of the RIE gases can penetrate deep into the \u201cinert\u201d layers and significantly modify them. For example, nitrogen used as component to etch spin-on carbon layers was found to travel up to 70 nm deep into Si HM materials and create layers with different material properties within this film. The question is being raised and discussed to which extent this atom implantation may impact the pattern transfer of the ever shrinking features.", "In this work, we explore the performances of a low-temperature PEALD technology used to trim/clean/smooth and reshape ArF photoresist lines that could subsequently receive an in-situ spacer deposition required to build up any SAxP grating. Different gas mixtures (O2, N2, H2, Ar and combinations) are evaluated on both blanket and patterned wafers. Trim rate, line profile, surface roughness and chemical modification are characterized using ellipsometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The photoresist line roughness is measured from top down SEM imaging and the different contributors to the roughness determined from a Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis. Few results obtained on EUV photoresist blanket wafers using similar plasma treatments will also be briefly presented.", "Despite the fact that the resolution of conventional contact/proximity lithography can reach feature sizes down to ~0.5- 0.6 micrometers, the accurate control of the linewidth and uniformity becomes already very challenging for gratings with periods in the range of 1-2 \u03bcm. This is particularly relevant for the exposure of large areas and wafers thinner than 300 \u03bcm. If the wafer or mask surface is not fully flat due to any kind of defects, such as bowing/warpage or remaining topography of the surface in case of overlay exposures, noticeable linewidth variations or complete failure of lithography step will occur. We utilized the newly developed Displacement Talbot lithography to pattern gratings with equal lines and spaces and periods in the range of 1.0 to 2.4 \u03bcm. The exposures in this lithography process do not require contact between the mask and the wafer, which makes it essentially insensitive to surface planarity and enables exposures with very high linewidth uniformity on thin and even slightly deformed wafers. We demonstrated pattern transfer of such exposures into Si substrates by reactive ion etching using the Bosch process. An etching depth of 30 \u03bcm or more for the whole range of periods was achieved, which corresponds to very high aspect ratios up to 60:1. The application of the fabricated gratings in phase contrast x-ray imaging is presented.", "Recent chemically amplified resists used for Negative Tone Development (NTD) processes exhibit a significant amount of resist shrinkage during post-exposure-bake (PEB). Some NTD resists show up to 25% thickness loss during PEB in the exposed regions. A detailed analysis of this and other experimental observations is published elsewhere.1 In particular, it has also been demonstrated that the shrinkage during PEB can have a strong impact on both, the CDs and the resist profile shapes which are formed after Negative Tone Development. We therefore highlight the necessity to augment physical modeling of the PEB process step for these NTD photoresists. To account for the shrinkage process during PEB in lithography simulations we start with the following modeling assumptions: The tendency for shrinkage is due to the collapse of the void space (free volume) which is formed after evaporation of the volatile byproduct of the de-protection reaction. However, this will not only induce a (vertical) resist height loss but causes also lateral displacements inside the resist. This yields distorted concentration profiles of all the species that are typically tracked during PEB simulations. In particular, a distorted degree of protection after PEB will result in resist profiles with tilted sidewall angles and changed CDs. As will be shown these effects are strongly pitch-dependent and must be accounted for in a physical simulation approach as well as in OPC modeling. In this work, we discuss our simulation approach to account for mechanical deformations. Using exemplary simulations, we determine the impact of the main effects which are captured by the model. In order to validate the simulation model, the simulated effect of shrinkage-induced mechanical deformations during PEB on CDs and on resist profiles is compared with experimental data.", "For 2x nm node semiconductor devices and beyond, more aggressive resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) such as source-mask co-optimization (SMO), litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE) and self-aligned double patterning (SADP) are utilized for the low k1 factor lithography processes. In the SADP process, the pattern fidelity is extremely critical since a slight photoresist (PR) top-loss or profile roughness may impact the later core trim process, due to its sensitivity to environment. During the subsequent sidewall formation and core removal processes, the core trim profile weakness may worsen and induces serious defects that affect the final electrical performance. To predict PR top-loss, a rigorous lithography simulation can provide a reference to modify mask layouts; but it takes a much longer run time and is not capable of full-field mask data preparation. In this paper, we first brought out an algorithm which utilizes multi-intensity levels from conventional aerial image simulation to assess the physical profile through lithography to core trim etching steps. Subsequently, a novel correction method was utilized to improve the post-etch pattern fidelity without the litho. process window suffering. The results not only matched PR top-loss in rigorous lithography simulation, but also agreed with post-etch wafer data. Furthermore, this methodology can also be incorporated with OPC and post-OPC verification to improve core trim profile and final pattern fidelity at an early stage.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) has been expected to become one of the most promising next generation lithography candidates for sub-15 nm line patterning and sub-20 nm contact hole patterning. In order to provide the DSA lithography to practical use in advanced semiconductor device manufacturing, defect mitigation in the DSA materials and processes is the primary challenge. We need to clarify the defect generation mechanism using in-situ measurement of self-assembling processes of BCPs in cooperation with modeling approaches to attain the DSA defect mitigation. In this work, we thus employed in-situ atomic force microscope (AFM) and grazing-incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GI-SAXS) and investigated development of surface morphology as well as internal structure during annealing processes. Figure 1 shows series of the AFM images of PMAPOSS-b-PTFEMA films during annealing processes. The images clearly show that vitrified sponge-like structure without long-range order in as-spun film transforms into lamellar structure and that the long range order of the lamellar structure increases with annealing temperature. It is well-known that ordering processes of BCPs from disordered state in bulk progress via nucleation and growth. In contrary to the case of bulk, the observed processes seem to be spinodal decomposition. This is because the structure in as-spun film is not the concentration fluctuation of disordered state but the vitrified sponge-like structure. The annealing processes induce order-order transition from non-equilibrium ordered-state to the lamellar structure. The surface tension assists the transition and directs the orientation. Figure 2 shows scattering patterns of (a) vicinity of film top and (b) whole sample of the GI-SAXS. We can find vertically oriented lamellar structure in the vicinity of film top while horizontally oriented lamellar structures in the vicinity of film bottom, indicating that the GI-SAXS measurement can clarify the variation of the morphologies in depth direction and that the surface tension affects the orientation of the lamellar structure. Finally a combination of the time development data in the in-situ AFM and the GI-SAXS is used to develop a kinetic modeling for prediction of dynamical change in three-dimensional nano-structures. A part of this work was funded by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan under the EIDEC project.", "Until recent years, dimensional scaling allowed for the fabrication of smaller and faster devices with increasing capacity. Currently, the limited area and the high density of the features in such devices have made self-aligned contacts/vias (SAC or SAV) a standard technique to overcome the decreasing distance between electrically functional elements in integrated circuits. In SAV schemes, the use of hard masks to define the effective transferred patterns allows for more relaxed via patterning conditions and overlay requirements. In this work, we explore a DSA-based fully self-aligned vias (FSAV) flow to further improve on traditional SAV processes. We use directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) to generate topographic features between the metal lines, which in combination with SAV, extend the benefits of this method to both X-Y directions, while maximizing the distance between the contacts and the adjacent not-connected metal lines to avoid potential shorts, as shown in Figure 1. In order to achieve this, patterned metal and/or dielectric lines are selectively functionalized using homopolymer brushes, to form a 1:1 chemical nano-pattern of specific surface energy, such that, when a BCP layer is coated and annealed on these samples, each block will align to the metal (or dielectric) lines underneath, as shown on Figure 2. We subsequently use one of the blocks as a template to generate topographic features between the metal lines. In addition, different hard masks are characterized to find the optimal material for the current scheme. Finally, we define the design rules for integration of the proposed flow into electrical devices.", "In this study, the integrity and the benefits of the DSA shrink process were verified through a via-chain test structure, which was fabricated by either DSA or baseline litho/etch process for via layer formation while metal layer processes remain the same. The nearest distance between the vias in this test structure is below 60nm, therefore, the following process components were included: 1) lamella-forming BCP for forming self-aligned via (SAV), 2) EUV printed guiding pattern, and 3) PS-philic sidewall. The local CDU (LCDU) of minor axis was improved by 30% after DSA shrink process. We compared two DSA Via shrink processes and a DSA_Control process, in which guiding patterns (GP) were directly transferred to the bottom OPL without DSA shrink. The DSA_Control apparently resulted in larger CD, thus, showed much higher open current and shorted the dense via chains. The non-optimized DSA shrink process showed much broader current distribution than the improved DSA shrink process, which we attributed to distortion and dislocation of the vias and ineffective SAV. Furthermore, preliminary defectivity study of our latest DSA process showed that the primary defect mode is likely to be etch-related. The challenges, strategies applied to improve local CD uniformity and electrical current distribution, and potential adjustments were also discussed.", "Grapho-epitaxy directed self-assembly is a potential low-cost solution for patterning via layers with pitches beyond the reach of a single optical lithographic exposure. In this process, selective control of the interfacial energy at the bottom and sidewall of the template is an important but challenging exercise. In this work, a dual brush process is implemented, in which two brushes with distinct end-groups are consecutively grafted to the pre-pattern to achieve fully independent modification of the bottom and sidewall surface of the template. A comprehensive study of hole pattern quality shows that using a dual brush process leads to a substantial improvement in terms of positional and dimensional variability across the process window. These findings will be useful to others who wish to manipulate polymer-surface interactions in directed self-assembly flows.", "Directed self-assembly of block copolymers is considered one of the candidates to fulfill the requirements of the next technological nodes [1,2]. Polymer domains are aligned by using a chemical and/or a topographical pre-pattern in which preferential surfaces to one of the two blocks or neutral wetting areas are created. In particular, polystyrene-block-polymetylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) has been extensively studied during the last years showing strong capabilities to define periodic nanostructures. However, the relatively low Flory-Huggins parameter and, the resulting low segregation strength of PS-b-PMMA systems, limit their achievable resolution to around 11 nm [3]. The application of block copolymer on sub-10 nm technologies requires the development of the new block copolymer generation known as high- block copolymers. Additionally, an important requirement for their integration on the lithography roadmap is the capability of selectively remove one of the two blocks. The etch contrast between the two domains is typically low due to their organic chemistry. In this sense, selective sequential infiltration synthesis by ALD into one of the blocks can be used in order to incorporate an inorganic material. The formed organic/inorganic blend sustains better the plasma etching to remove the non-infiltrated organic block. In this contribution, we show the use of high- polystyrene-b-polylactide acid (PS-b-PLA) lamellar block copolymer for line/space applications. PS-b-PLA has a larger Flory-Huggins parameter (=0.218 at room temperature[4]) compared with PS-b-PMMA, allowing the size reduction of the self-assembled domains. The method to control the orientation of the polymer domains is similar to the one typically used for PS-b-PMMA. Chemical contrast and the subsequent alignment of the polymer domains are achieved by the definition of a chemical pre-pattern on a random copolymer PS-r-PMMA (48% of PS) (figure 1). The polymer brush is grafted on the substrate and then locally modified by the combination of e-beam lithography and soft oxygen plasma. Afterwards, the PS-b-PLA block copolymer is spin-coated and thermally annealed on the chemically pre-patterned substrate. A chemical contrast is observed between the modified and unmodified stripes. While, the lamellar domains are oriented perpendicular to the substrate on unmodified areas, PLA domains are strongly attracted to the O2 modified surfaces inducing a parallel orientation to the substrate. Additionally, the wetting behavior of the polymer domains is also studied through the difference of surface free energy between the substrate and each polymer block. The energy estimated by the Young\u00b4s equation [\u0394\u03b3 =\u03b3SA -\u03b3SB= \u03b3AB\u00b7cos(\u00d8AB)], where \u03b3SA and \u03b3SB are the interface tensions between homo-polymers A and B with the substrate, and \u00d8AB is the contact angle between A and B homo-polymers which is obtained in de-wetting experiments. Finally, sequential infiltration synthesis is used to selectively infiltrate alumina (Al3O2) on PLA domains (figure 2). A selective infiltration is achieved because the precursor molecules react with the carbonyl (C=O) groups that are only present in the PLA block. After five cycles of SIS, the SIS modified PLA domains become more resistant to O2 plasma etching than PS enabling the PS etching without using other kind of hard-masks. The research leading to these results received funding from the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Program FP7/2007-2013, under the project CoLiSA and the European Nanoelectronics Initiative Advisory Council under the project PLACYD (ENIAC-2013-2).

Soc. 124 (2002) 12761-12773", "High-\u03c7 block copolymers for directed self-assembly (DSA) patterning that do not need topcoat or solvent annealing have been developed. A variety of functionalities have been successfully added into the block copolymers, such as balanced surface energy between the polymer blocks, outstandingly high \u03c7, tunable glass transition temperature (Tg), and selective crosslinking. Perpendicular orientation control, as desired for patterning, of the block copolymers can be simply achieved by thermal annealing due to the equal surface energy of the polymer blocks at the annealing temperatures, which allows avoiding solvent annealing or top-coat. The \u03c7 value can be tuned up to achieve L0 as low as 8-10 nm for lamellar-structured block copolymers and hole/pillar size as small as 5-6 nm for cylinder-structured block copolymers. The Tg of the block copolymers can be tuned to improve the kinetics of thermal annealing by enhancing the polymer chain mobility. Block-selective crosslinking facilitates the pattern transfer by mitigating pattern collapse during wet etching and improving oxygen plasma etching selectivity between the polymer blocks. This paper provides an introductory review of our high-\u03c7 block copolymer materials with various functionalities for achieving improved DSA performance.", "High chi organic lamellar-forming block copolymers were prepared with 18 nm intrinsic period Lo value. The BCPs were coated on a neutral layer on silicon substrates and were either thermally annealed or exposed to solvent vapors both in a 300mm track. The effect of lowering the glass transition temperature (Tg) on the high chi BCP was investigated. Process temperatures and times were varied. It was found that the BCP having lower Tg exhibits faster kinetics and is able to reach alignment in a shorter time than a similar BCP having higher Tg. Fingerprint defect analysis also shows that the BCP with lower Tg has lower defects. The results show that fingerprint formation can be achieved with either ether or ester type solvents depending on the BCP used. The results show that a track process for solvent annealing of high-\u03c7 BCPs is feasible and could provide the path forward for incorporation of BCP in future nodes. Finally, directed self-assembly was demonstrated by implemented high chi polymers on a graphoepitaxy test vehicles. CD and line width roughness was evaluated on patterns with a multiplication factor up to 7.", "Xylan, one of hemicellulose family, block copolymer was newly developed for wide-range directed self-assembly lithography (DSA). Xylan is higher hydrophilic material because of having many hydroxy groups in one molecule. It means that xylan block copolymer has a possibility of high-chi block copolymer. Generally, DSA is focused on microphase separation for smaller size with high-chi block copolymer and not well known for larger size. In this study, xylan block copolymer was confirmed enabling wider range of patterning size, from smaller size to larger size. The key of xylan block copolymer is a new molecular structure of block copolymer and sugar chain control technology. Sugar content is the important parameter for not only micro-phase separation property but also line edge roughness (LER) and defects. Based on the sugar control technology, wide-range (hp 8.3nm to 26nm L/S and CD 10nm to 51nm hole) DSA patterning was demonstrated. Additionally it was confirmed that xylan block copolymer is suitable for sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) process.", "To design processes that effectively use polymer directed self-assembly, we would like to have a complete picture of stable and defective polymer configurations. Field-theoretic simulations are an effective way to gain knowledge about these configurations and predict defect populations: we can easily vary design parameters such as prepattern dimensions, wetting conditions and polymer composition/architecture and observe their effects on pattern formation. We previously showed that an optimized phase field model, a modification of the Ohta-Kawasaki model, is more accurate at predicting domain spacing and defect formation in bulk systems. This accuracy is achieved by a systematic mapping procedure that optimizes parameters in the model using inexpensive, low-dimensional selfconsistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. We now make two improvements to the model. First, we implement a conjugate gradient method, a more efficient numerical solver for phase field models not available to SCFT, and characterize its performance. We find that an optimized phase field model simulation requires one to two orders of magnitude less computation time than an SCFT simulation of the same system. Second, we extend our model to confined templates and demonstrate that the new model does not suffer from the nonphysical behavior found in other phase field models in the presence of confining walls.", "The effects of thermal fluctuations in graphoepitaxy DSA are studied using simulations based on the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) model. The known method of using an external potential field to displace or deform the DSA cylinder is employed to study the dependencies of the fluctuations of the position and the size of the DSA cylinder as a function of the confinement well diameter. An explanation to local minima of these dependencies is proposed. A new and faster method to estimate the effects of fluctuations in DSA based on a family of transformations of SCFT potential fields is described and tested.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers has attracted much interest for its use as a low-cost, high throughput patterning tool to supplement existing lithographic techniques, and especially for its ability to easily pattern vertical interconnect accesses (VIAs).1 Assembling multiple cylinders in a single template has obvious advantages for feature density increase. However, denser patterning comes at a cost, due to more abundant defect modes2 and increased susceptibility to placement errors due to thermal fluctuations. Linear arrays of cylinders have been shown in a simplified model to contain collective excitations, ultimately leading to unbounded positional variance away from their equilibrium locations in a manner analogous to a one-dimensional crystal.3 In order to reduce this positional uncertainty, we introduce chemically selective stripes on the substrate of the system. These chemoepitaxially patterned regions create an energetic preference for the equilibrium configuration of the system, pinning the VIAs in place. In this study, we use three-dimensional self-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulations and complex Langevin (CL) sampling to investigate the effects of thermal fluctuations on cylinder positions in linear arrays of VIAs with preferentially striped substrates. We interrogate the relationship between stripe interaction strength and positional variance, compare the magnitude of reduction with a Landau-Peierls analysis on a simplified system, and propose a predictive model for placement error in similarly chemo patterned systems. Since the cylinders are flexible, we propose a maximum system height for linear arrays with acceptably low placement error.", "The semiconductor industry is evaluating a variety of approaches for the cost efficient production of future processing and memory generations. Amongst the technologies being explored are multiple patterning steps, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, multiple-beam electron beam lithography and the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs). BCP DSA utilizes a chemical or topographical template to induce long range order in a thin film of BCP which enhances the resolution of the original pattern. The characterization of buried structure within a DSA BCP film is challenging due to the lack of contrast between the organic materials. Critical-dimension small angle x-ray scattering (CDSAXS) measurements were performed on DSA BCP films, using soft X-rays to tune the contrast, in order to understand the relationship between template structure and film morphology.1 The results of these measurements show that as the width of the guiding stripe widens the arrangement of the BCP on the guiding stripe inverts, shifting from the A block being centered on the guiding stripe to the B block being centered on the guiding stripe. The initial results of integration of mean field simulations into the analysis of scattering data will also be discussed. In addition to examining the BCP structure with CDSAXS, soft X-ray reflectivity2 measurements were performed on BCP to better understand the relationship between interface width for systems with alternative architectures (triblocks) and additives (polymers/ionic liquids). The addition of a selectively associating additive increases the interaction parameter between the two blocks, resulting in the reduction of the interface width and access to smaller pitches. The use of soft X-ray reflectivity allows the evaluation of the distribution of the additive. (1) Sunday, D. F.; Hammond, M. R.; Wang, C.; Wu, W.; Delongchamp, D. M.; Tjio, M.; Cheng, J.

By irradiating a responsive interfacial surface, the orientation and selective patterning of block copolymer domains could be achieved. We demonstrated that spatially-selective lamellar orientation of polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) could be induced via modification of an underlying SAM; for instance the conversion of an NO2 group to an NH2 group, induced by EB. The lamellar orientation of PS-b-PMMA was controlled by the change in the polarity of different regions of the SAM using EB lithography. The reductive treatment of SAM substrates plays a crucial role in the orientation of block copolymer. This method might greatly simplify block copolymer DSA processes as compared to the conventional multi-step chemo-epitaxy DSA process. By examining the lamellae orientation by EB, we found that the vertical orientation persists only for appropriate an irradiation dose and annealing temperature.", "With the increasing prevalence of complex device integration schemes, tri layer patterning with a solvent strippable hardmask can have a variety of applications. Spin-on metal hardmasks have been the key enabler for selective removal through wet strip when active areas need to be protected from dry etch damage. As spin-on metal hardmasks require a dedicated track to prevent metal contamination, and are limited in their ability to scale down thickness without comprising on defectivity, there has been a need for a deposited hardmask solution. Modulation of film composition through deposition conditions enables a method to create TiO2 films with wet etch tunability. This paper presents a systematic study on development and characterization of PEALD deposited TiO2-based hardmasks for patterning applications. We demonstrate lithographic process window, pattern profile, and defectivity evaluation for a tri layer scheme patterned with PEALD based TiO2 hardmask and its performance under dry and wet strip conditions. Comparable structural and electrical performance is shown for a deposited vs a spin-on metal hardmask.", "For fine patterning, there are two possible hard mask integration schemes: quad-layer and tri-layer systems. Due to the different structures and processes between quad- and tri- layer systems, each system needs specific chemical and physical properties of the hard mask. In this paper, we report the properties of the carbon-based spin-on hard mask (CSOH) candidates for various hard mask integrations.", "In the recent of the semiconductor manufacturing process, variety of properties (narrow gap-filling and planarity etc.) are required to organic BARC in addition to the conventional requirements. Moreover, SC-1 resistance is also needed because BARC is often used as a wet etching mask when TiN processing. But conventional BARC which include crosslinker doesn\u2019t have enough SC-1 resistance, and we found that it is also difficult to obtain good gap-filling and good planarity because of outgassing and film shrinkage derived from the crosslinker. In this study, we have developed the new self-crosslinking BARC. The new crosslinking system shows low outgassing and film shrinkage because of not including crosslinker. So, novel BARC has better gap filling property and planarity and over 3 times higher SC-1 resistance than that of conventional BARC. Moreover, by adding the low molecular weight additive which has high adhesive unit to TiN surface, the novel BARC has over 10 times higher SC-1 resistance than that of conventional BARC. And this novel BARC can be applied both ArF and KrF lithography process because of broad absorbance, high etching rate, chemical resistance (SC-1, SC-2, DHF, and others) and good film thickness uniformity. In this paper, we will discuss the detail of new self-crosslinking BARC in excellent total performance and our approach to achieve high chemical resistance.", "In this paper proof-of-principle demonstrations of spin-on carbon (SOC)/spin-on glass (SOG)-based lithography processes which could replace standard patterning stacks within the FEOL for upcoming advanced nodes like N10/N7 are presented. At these dimensions the standard lithography approaches that have been utilized within the previous nodes will begin to run into fundamental limitations as a result of the extremely high aspect ratios of the device topography, requiring both new materials as well as new patterning flows in order to allow for continued device scaling. Here, novel SOC/SOG-based patterning flows have been demonstrated which could be applied to implement Source Drain Extension implantations and epitaxial growth processes for CMOS FinFET device architectures even down at N10/N7 dimensions.", "Planarization is a critical unit step in the lithography process because it enables patterning of surfaces with versatile pattern density without compromising on the stringent planarity and depth-of-focus requirements. In addition to nanoscale pattern density variation, parasitics such as pre-existing wafer topography, can corrupt the desired process output after planarization. The topography of any surface can be classified in three broad categories, depending upon the amplitude and spatial wavelength of the same [1], [2]: (i) nominal shape, (ii) nanotopography and (iii) roughness. The nominal shape is given by the largest spatial wavelengths, typically < 20mm. For spatial length scales of ~1-20mm, height variations at this spatial wavelength range are classified as nanotopography. Roughness usually has lower spatial wavelengths. While the nominal shape of a substrate surface is usually decided by the nature of wafer preparation and the tooling and chucking infrastructure used in the same, roughness is usually mitigated by standard polishing techniques. It is the intermediate nanotopography that is probably the most critical surface topography parameter. This is because most traditional polishing techniques cannot selectively address pre-existing substrate topography, without introducing a parasitic signature at the scale of nanotopography. Moreover, fields with pattern density variation typically also have length scales that are commensurate with nanotopography. It is thus instructive to summarize existing planarization technology to understand current limitations. Spin on Glass and Etch back is one technique used for micron scale device manufacturing [3]. As the name implies, a glass dielectric is spin-coated on the substrate followed by etching in a chemistry that ensures equal etching rates for both the sacrificial glass and the underlying film or substrate material. Photoresists may also be used instead of glass. However, the global planarity that can be achieved by this technique is limited. Also, planarization over a large isolated topographical feature has been studied for the reverse-tone Jet-and-Flash Imprint Lithography process, also known as JFIL-R [4]. This relies on surface tension and capillary effects to smoothen a spin-coated Si containing film that can be etched to obtain a smooth profile. To meet the stringent requirement of planarity in submicron device technologies Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) is the most widely used planarization technology [5], [6]. It uses a combination of abrasive laden chemical slurry and a mechanical pad for achieving planar profiles. The biggest concern with CMP is the dependence of material removal rate on the pattern density of material, leading to the formation of a step between the high density and low-density. The step shows up as a long-range thickness variation in the planarized film, similar in scale to pre-existing substrate topography that should have been polished away. Preventive techniques like dummy fill and patterned resist can be used to reduce the variation in pattern density. These techniques increase the complexity of the planarization process and significantly limit the device design flexibility. Contact Planarization (CP) has also been reported as an alternative to the CMP processing [7], [8]. A substrate is spin coated with a photo curable material and pre baked to remove residual solvent. An ultra-flat surface or an optical flat is pressed on the spin-coated wafer. The material is forced to reflow. Pressure is used to spread out material evenly and achieve global planarization. The substrate is then exposed to UV radiation to harden the photo curable material. Although attractive, this process is not adaptive as it does not account for differences in surface topography of the wafer and the optical flat, nor can it address all the parasitics that arise during the process itself. The optical flat leads to undesirable planarization of even the substrate nominal shape and nanotopography, which corrupts the final film thickness profile. Hence, it becomes extremely difficult to eliminate this signature to a desirable extent without introducing other parasitic signatures. An example of this is shown in Figure 1. In this paper, a novel adaptive planarization process has been presented that potentially addresses the problems associated with planarization of varying pattern density, even in the presence of pre-existing substrate topography [9]. This process is called Inkjet-enabled Adaptive Planarization (IAP). The IAP process uses an inverse optimization scheme, built around a validated fluid mechanics-based forward model [10], that takes the pre-existing substrate topography and pattern layout as inputs. It then generates an inkjet drop pattern with a material distribution that is correlated with the desired planarization film profile. This allows a contiguous film to be formed with the desired thickness variation to cater to the topography and any parasitic signatures caused by the pattern layout. This film is formed by the coercing action of a compliant superstrate, which forces the drops to spread and merge and eliminates any bubble trapping. Then, the film is cured using blanket UV exposure and the superstrate separated to reveal the desired planarized film. The use of an inverse optimization algorithm allows substrate topography to be addressed adaptively. In other words, the algorithm can generate a drop pattern that does not disturb the pre-existing substrate topography substantially, but only caters to the pattern density variation. This process has potential advantages over other planarization techniques because of its adaptive nature. Hence, the IAP process can cater to substrates of varying topographies and pattern densities by changing the inkjetted material distribution, without any changes in hardware. The IAP process can also address pre-existing substrate topography selectively by conforming to the nominal shape while planarizing over the pattern layout. A schematic of the IAP process is shown in Figure 2. The goal of this paper is to present some preliminary results from the IAP process. A test pattern layout has been generated with the help of photolithography, and is shown in Figure 3. For the purpose of this trial, the nanoscale features have not been patterned, as it is expected that the planarization process will be blind to their presence. Thus, areas with nanoscale patterns have been patterned as a single feature of SiO2 with height equal to 100 nm. These features are adjacent to pattern-less areas, thus marking a drastic change in pattern density. As can be seen in Figure 4, the smallest length scale across which pattern density changes, is 70 microns. The goal of the IAP process is to be able to planarize this pattern with a film that conforms to pre-existing substrate topography. The targeted planarity of the film is 95% 3sigma, while the targeted film thickness at the tallest feature is less than 30 nm. In another trial, the inverse tone of the same layout will also be tested. This pattern has features of height equal to 100 nm where the previous pattern did not. The targeted metrics for the inverse layout are the same as the nominal layout.", "Pattern transfer is critical to any lithographic technology, and plays a significant role in defining the critical features in a device layer. As both the memory and logic roadmaps continue to advance, greater importance is placed on the scheme used to do the etching. For many critical layers, a need has developed which requires a multilayer stack to be defined in order to perform the pattern transfer. There are many cases however, where this standard approach does not provide the best results in terms of critical dimension (CD) fidelity and CD uniformity. As an example, when defining a contact pattern, it may be advantageous to apply a bright field mask (in order to maximize the normalized inverse log slope (NILS)) over the more conventional dark field mask. The result of applying the bright field mask in combination with positive imaging resist is to define an array of pillar patterns, which then must be converted back to holes before etching the underlying dielectric material. There have been several publications on tone reversal that is introduced in the resist process itself, but often an etch transfer process is applied to reverse the pattern tone. The purpose of this paper is to describe the use of a three layer reverse tone process (RTP) that is capable of reversing the tone of every printed feature type. The process utilizes a resist pattern, a hardmask layer and an additional protection layer. The three layer approach overcomes issues encountered when using a single masking layer. Successful tone reversal was demonstrated both on 300mm wafers and imprint masks, including the largest features in the pattern, with dimensions as great as 60 microns. Initial in-field CD uniformity is promising. CDs shifted by about 2.6nm and no change was observed in either LER or LWR. Follow-up work is required to statistically qualify in-field CDU and also understand both across wafer uniformity and feature linearity.", "In our previous paper dealing with multi-patterning, we proposed a new indicator to quantify the quality of final wafer pattern transfer, called interactive pattern fidelity error (IPFE). It detects patterning failures resulting from any source of variation in creating integrated patterns. IPFE is a function of overlay and edge placement error (EPE) of all layers comprising the final pattern (i.e. lower and upper layers). In this paper, we extend the use cases with Via in additional to the bridge case (Block on Spacer). We propose an IPFE budget and CD budget using simple geometric and statistical models with analysis of a variance (ANOVA). In addition, we validate the model with experimental data. From the experimental results, improvements in overlay, local-CDU (LCDU) of contact hole (CH) or pillar patterns (especially, stochastic pattern noise (SPN)) and pitch walking are all critical to meet budget requirements. We also provide a special note about the importance of the line length used in analyzing LWR. We find that IPFE and CD budget requirements are consistent to the table of the ITRS\u2019s technical requirement. Therefore the IPFE concept can be adopted for a variety of integrated structures comprising digital logic circuits. Finally, we suggest how to use IPFE for yield management and optimization requirements for each process.", "A continuing goal in integrated circuit industry is to increase density of features within patterned masks. One pathway being used by the device manufacturers for patterning beyond the ~80nm pitch limitation of 193 immersion lithography is the self-aligned spacer double patterning (SADP). Two orthogonal line space patterns with subsequent SADP can be used for contact holes multiplication. However, a combination of two immersion exposures, two spacer deposition processes, and two etch processes to reach the desired dimensions makes this process expensive and complicated. One alternative technique for contact hole multiplication is the use of an array of pillar patterns. Pillars, imaged with 193 immersion photolithography, can be uniformly deposited with spacer materials until a hole is formed in the center of 4 pillars. Selective removal of the pillar core gives a reversal of phases, a contact hole where there was once a pillar. However, the highly conformal nature of conventional spacer materials causes a problem with this application. The new holes, formed between 4 pillars, by this method have a tendency to be imperfect and not circular. To improve the contact hole circularity, this paper presents the use of both conventional spacer material and soft spacer materials. Application of soft spacer materials can be achieved by an existing coating track without additional cost burden to the device manufacturers.", "Abstract Multiple patterning employing etch shrink extends the scaling of hardmask open CD (HCD) to sub-50nm regime. A plasma-assisted shrink technique is primarily used in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) however it faces major challenges such as the line end shortening (LES) and large critical dimension iso-dense bias (IDB). In order to mitigate these two problems we apply an atomic layer deposition (ALD) spacer shrink process at 10nm metal interconnect layer with sub-20nm minimum half-pitch. As a result we observed 8nm LES improvement in tip-to-tip (T2T) two-dimensional (2D) structures, and 5nm IDB reduction in one-dimensional (1D) structures. These improvements suggest that the ALD spacer shrink can contribute to more precise CD control in multiple patterning.", "Two dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) materials have the growing potential to upstage graphene in the next generation of biosensors in detecting lower-concentrated areas of biomolecules. The current gold-standard detection method is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), an immunological assay technique that makes use of an enzyme bonded to a particular antibody or antigen. However, this technique is not only bulky, labor-intensive, and time extensive, but more importantly, the ELISA has relatively low detection limits of only 600 femtomolar (fM). In this work, for the first time, we present a novel flexible, sensitive MoS2 (molybdenum disulfide) biosensor, as shown in Figure 1, composed of few-layer of MoS2 as the channel material, and flexible polyimide as the substrate. In order to nano-fabricate this flexible biosensor, we mechanically transferred a few layers of MoS2 onto the flexible substrate polyimide and photolithography to create a patterning on the surface, and as a result, we were able to create a transistor that used MoS2 as its conductance channel. We successfully fabricated this MoS2 biosensor onto a flexible polyimide substrate. Furthermore, the fabricated flexible MoS2 biosensor can be utilized for quantifying the time-dependent reaction kinetics of streptavidin-biotin binding. Figure 2 shows the transfer characteristics of flexible MoS2 biosensors measured under different concentrations of streptavidin. The flexible MoS2 biosensor could illustrate a faster detection time in matters of minutes, and higher sensitivity with detection limits as low as 10 fM. Time versus equilibrium constants will be presented in details.", "Due to its chemical specificity, the near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy is an interesting technique to study the changes in hybrid organic-inorganic photoresists. In this work, we analyzed the chemical changes occurring in photoresists synthesized from organically modified precursors and transition metal alkoxides by sol-gel route. These systems are nonchemically amplified resists for ultraviolet, extreme ultraviolet, and electron beam lithography. They are based on Si, Zr, and Ti oxides or a combination of these. The experiments were conducted at the PolLux beamline of the Swiss Light Source, by a scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, which combines the spatially-resolved microscopy and fine structure spectroscopy at once. The absorption spectra were collected in the energy range of the carbon edge (\u2248 290 eV) before and after in situ exposure of the photoresists to 500 eV photons. The variations in peak intensity after exposure reveal the changes in the chemical environment of carbon and the chemical configuration of the organic ligands, regardless of the inorganic part. It was found that the photon exposure induced sizable photodegradation or photopolymerization of organic groups (phenyl or methyl methacrylate, respectively). These mechanisms contribute to the foundation for the exposure reaction in negative-tone hybrid photoresists. Interestingly, it was also found that the detachment of the phenyl ligand occurs in a variety of possible pathways to condensation. We believe that our results and approach can provide a better understanding of photochemistry of resists, in particular for extreme ultraviolet lithography.", "Traditional diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) positive photoresists are widely used for TFT-LCD array process. Current LTPS technology has more than 600ppi resolution is required for small or middle-sized TFT liquid crystal display panels. One of the ways to enhance resolution is to apply i-line single exposure system instead of traditional g/h/ibroadband exposure system. We have been developing i-line chemically amplified photoresist ECA 200 series for the next generation flat panel display (FPD). ECA 200 consists of three components: a phenol resin, a photo acid generator and dissolution enhancer. We applied two different types of dissolution enhancers with two different kinds of protected groups to our resist materials. As a result, we achieved higher sensitivity, higher resolution, less footing of the resist profile and reduced standing wave effect compared with traditional DNQ photoresists. In addition, we have found further property of photoresist that does not need post exposure bake (PEB) process. This resist has a great advantage at most of current panel plants without PEB process.", "Two scanning electron beam lithography (SEBL) patterning processes have been developed, one positive and one negative tone. The processes feature nanometer-scale resolution, chemical amplification for faster throughput, long film life under vacuum, and sufficient etch resistance to enable patterning of a variety of materials with a metal-free (CMOS/MEMS compatible) tool set. These resist processes were developed to address two limitations of conventional SEBL resist processes: (1) low areal throughput and (2) limited compatibility with the traditional microfabrication infrastructure.", "Cracked gasses generated from imprinted materials and/or involved solvents cause transcriptional defects on template materials and insufficient filling of imprinted materials in nanoimprint lithography. This study aims to create the novel gas permeable nanoimprint template materials to prevent such defects caused by cracked gasses and involved solvents. A biomass based template was investigated in thermal and UV nanoimprint lithography instead of the conventional template such as quartz, PMDS, DLC, block copolymers. The line patterning results using the biomass based gas permeable template in nanoimprint lithography were better to reduce the line pattern failure compared with that of quartz based template as a reference. Gas transmission coefficient was evaluated for template materials having thermal crosslinkable urethane groups. The proposed nanoimprint lithography using biomass based gas permeable template is one of the most promising processes ready to be investigated for mass-production of fine device applications.", "Weak-polar solvents like PGMEA (Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether Acetate) or CHN (Cyclohexanone) are used to dissolve hydrophobic photo-resist polymers, which are challenging for traditional cleaning methods such as distillation, ion-exchange resins service or water-washing processes. This paper investigated two novel surface modifications to see their effectiveness at metal removal and to understand the mechanism. The experiments yielded effective purification methods for metal reduction, focusing on solvent polarities based on HSP (Hansen Solubility Parameters), and developing optimal purification strategies.", "Novolak resists have been widely used in IC production and are used to this day in the production of flat panel displays (FPDs) and MEMS. However, with the advent of high-definition devices, FPDs must meet growing requirements for finer dimensions. These trends have generated requirements for higher sensitivity, higher resolution, and wider process margins for novolak resists. Using a lithography simulator with the goal of improving the performance of novolak resists, we examined various approaches to improving resist materials. This report discusses efforts to improve resolution and to broaden process margins using a novolak resin that exhibits a higher degree of fractionation than in the previous report (maximum fractionated resin) with the addition of low molecular weight phenol resins.", "Hardmask processes are a key technique to enable low-k semiconductors, but they can have an impact on patterning control, influencing defectivity, alignment, and overlay. Specifically, amorphous carbon layer (ACL) hardmask schemes can negatively affect overlay by creating distorted alignment signals. A new scheme needs to be developed that can be inserted where amorphous carbon is used but provide better alignment performance. Typical spin-on carbon (SOC) materials used in other hardmask schemes have issues with DCD-FCD skew. In this paper we will evaluate new spin-on carbon material with a higher carbon content that could be a candidate to replace amorphous carbon.", "Lithographic scaling continues to advance by extending the life of 193nm immersion technology, and spacer-type multi-patterning is undeniably the driving force behind this trend. Multi-patterning techniques such as self-aligned double patterning (SADP) and self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) have come to be used in memory devices, and they have also been adopted in logic devices to create constituent patterns in the formation of 1D layout designs. Multi-patterning has consequently become an indispensible technology in the fabrication of all advanced devices. In general, items that must be managed when using multi-patterning include critical dimension uniformity (CDU), line edge roughness (LER), and line width roughness (LWR). Recently, moreover, there has been increasing focus on judging and managing pattern resolution performance from a more detailed perspective and on making a right/wrong judgment from the perspective of edge placement error (EPE). To begin with, pattern resolution performance in spacer-type multi-patterning is affected by the process accuracy of the core (mandrel) pattern. Improving the controllability of CD and LER of the mandrel is most important, and to reduce LER, an appropriate smoothing technique should be carefully selected. In addition, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique is generally used to meet the need for high accuracy in forming the spacer film. Advances in scaling are accompanied by stricter requirements in the controllability of fine processing. In this paper, we first describe our efforts in improving controllability by selecting the most appropriate materials for the mandrel pattern and spacer film. Then, based on the materials selected, we present experimental results on a technique for improving etching selectivity.", "Gridded design rules[1] is major process in configuring logic circuit used 193-immersion lithography. In the scaling of grid patterning, we can make 10nm order line and space pattern by using multiple patterning techniques such as self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP) and litho-etch- litho-etch (LELE)[2][3][4] . On the other hand, Line cut process has some error parameters such as pattern defect, placement error, roughness and X-Y CD bias with the decreasing scale. We tried to cure hole pattern roughness to use additional process such as Line smoothing[5] . Each smoothing process showed different effect. As the result, CDx shrink amount is smaller than CDy without one additional process. In this paper, we will report the pattern controllability comparison of EUV and 193-immersion. And we will discuss optimum method about CD bias on hole pattern.", "One of the most critical issues associate with decreasing photo-resist feature size is pattern collapse, and more serious pattern collapse can be easily observed especially in asymmetric pitch environment due to unbalanced capillary stress acting on photo-resist pattern during development rinse step. The pattern collapse would kill product yield in the worse condition. This work investigates the approaches of mitigating the asymmetric pattern collapse behavior, such as adjusting photoresist pattern aspect ratio, applying surfactant during development rinse to reduce the solution surface tension, and altering underlying anti-reflection coating and hard-mask combinations to tailor the photo-resist bottom profile as well as decreasing developer permeation into photo-resist interface. Pattern sizing to resist unbalanced capillary force is also explored in the asymmetric pattern region. Two novel layout methods to mitigate asymmetric dummy pattern collapse were demonstrated and both methods were confirmed to have higher immunity against pattern collapse in asymmetric pitch environment.", "High density ultrahigh resolution patterning with desired shape and size is a crucial requirement in nanotechnology and its applications. Electron beam lithography (EBL) is the most widely used lithography tool for these applications. However, achieving cost-effective patterning with sub-10-nm critical dimension has been challenging due to the inherent tradeoff between resolution and throughput. In this paper, we present cost-effective new processes associated with EBL technique, which include optimized resist selection and processing as well as sonicated cold development process. Using this process, we demonstrate sub-10-nm diameter metal dots at a pitch of ~34 nm and sub-15 nm wide metal lines. Based on the same processes, we demonstrate the fabrication of u-shaped split ring resonator array of different metals with smallest fabricated resonator with ~60 nm size and v-shape SRRs with the smallest gap spacing of ~30 nm. By adjusting the SRR gap spacing through its arm length and opening angle, we have successfully demonstrated magnetic and electric resonances across the visible and ultraviolet range.", "Block copolymers (BCPs) can phase separate to form periodic structures with small spacings, making BCPs an attractive option for furthering the ability of optical lithography. Chemoepitaxy is a method of directed self-assembly (DSA) that uses preferential pinning stripes to guide the BCP. The periodicity of the underlayer\u2019s pinning stripe compared to the periodicity of the BCP is defined as the density multiplication. In this study molecular dynamics simulations are used to explore the effect density multiplication and pinning stripe position has on the free energy difference between a defective and defect-free BCP film. For all defect orders the highest free energies were obtained when a pinning stripe was located directly under or adjacent to the terminating block. At high density multiplications, the defects were found to approach the free energy of the same defect on an unpatterned underlayer. For all density multiplications and pinning stripe positions the free energy of defective films is significantly higher than that of defect-free films, suggesting the presence of defects in experiment is likely due to kinetic entrapment of defects. Free energy initially increases with increasing defect size, but was found to level off and even decrease for the largest defects in this work.", "PS-b-PMMA block copolymer is a well-known DSA material, and there are many DSA patterning methods that make effective the use of such 1st generation materials. Consequently, this variety of patterning methods opens a wide array of possibilities for DSA application[1-4]. Last year, during the inaugural International DSA Symposium, researchers and lithographers concurred on common key issues for DSA patterning methods such as: defect density, LWR, placement error, etc. Defect density was specifically expressed as the biggest obstacle for new processes. Coat-Develop track systems contribute to the DSA pattern fabrication and also influence the DSA pattern performances[4]. In this study, defectivity was investigated using an atmosphere-controlled chamber on the SOKUDO DUO track. As an initial step for expanding the DSA process window, fingerprint patterns were used for various atmospheric conditions during DSA self-assembly annealing. In this study, we will demonstrate an improved DSA process window, and then we will discuss the mechanism for this atmospheric effect.", "Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) process is one of the attractive processes for creating the very fine pitch pattern. In this technology, block-co-polymer is the key material to achieve a fine patterning. Many reports are published with Polystyrene-b-Polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) for DSA applications. But it is difficult to achieve the resolution below 10 nm with PS-b-PMMA because of its low chi value. Etching transfer of PS-b-PMMA is also the key issue due to the low etching selectivity between PS and PMMA during dry etching process. In this report, block-co-polymers that include a Si-containing monomer and an organic monomer were synthesized by living anionic polymerization to supply a high resolution and a high etching contrast. These polymers with a low polydispersity demonstrated lamella morphology that can be oriented by thermal annealing with a neutral surface treatment. The effects of underlayer and top-coat materials were investigated to control the block-co-polymer orientation. These block-co-polymers also achieve a high dry etching contrast.", "We have successfully synthesized various and over wide range molecular weight block copolymers (BCPs): these are polystyrene(PS)-polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA) as general components and poly(4-trimethylsilylstyrene)(PTMSS)- poly(4-hydroxystyrene)(PHS) system as very strong segregated components (high chi) and multiblock type of those copolymers which form the microphase-separated structure pattern using living anionic polymerizing method by which the size of polymer can be precisely controlled. In addition, we were able to observe alternating lamellar and cylinder structures which were formed by our various BCPs using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Moreover, we have successfully developed new apparatus for high volume manufacturing including our original technologies such as purification of monomer, improvement of wetted surface, and mechanical technology for high vacuum. And we have successfully synthesized all the BCPs with narrow molecular weight distribution (PDI <1.1) with large-scale apparatus.", "A thick spin-on carbon hardmask (SOH) material is designed to overcome inherent problems of amorphous deposited carbon layer (ACL) and thick photoresist. For ACL in use of semiconductor production process, especially when film thickness from sub-micrometer up to few micrometers is required, not only its inherent low transparency at long wavelength light often causes alignment problems with under layers, but also considerable variation of film thickness within a wafer can also cause patterning problems. To avoid these issues, a thick SOH is designed with monomers of high transparency and good solubility at the same time. In comparison with photoresist, the SOH has good etch resistance and high thermal stability, and it provides wide process window of decreased film thickness and increased thermal budget up to 400\u00b0C after processes such as high temperature deposition of SiON. In order to achieve high thickness along with uniform film, many solvent factors was considered such as solubility parameter, surface tension, vapor pressure, and others. By optimizing many solvent factors, we were able to develop a product with a good coating performance", "For multilayer process, importance of carbon-based spin-on hardmask material that replaces amorphous carbon layer (ACL) is ever increasing. Carbon-based spin-on hardmask is an organic polymer with high carbon content formulated in organic solvents for spin-coating application that is cured through baking. In comparison to CVD process for ACL, carbon-based spin-on hardmask material can offer several benefits: lower cost of ownership (CoO) and improved process time, as well as better gap-fill and planarization performances. Thus carbon-based spin-on hardmask material of high etch resistance, good gap-fill properties and global planarization performances over various pattern topographies are desired to achieve the fine patterning and high aspect ratio (A/R). In particular, good level of global planarization of spin coated layer over the underlying pattern topographies is important for self-aligned double patterning (SADP) process as it dictates the photolithographic margin. Herein, we report a copolymer carbon-based spin-on hardmask resin formulation that exhibits favorable film shrinkage profile and good etch resistance properties. By combining the favorable characteristics of each resin \u2013 one resin with good shrinkage property and the other with excellent etch resistance into the copolymer, it was possible to achieve a carbonbased spin-on hardmask formulation with desirable level of etch resistance and the planarization performances across various underlying substrate pattern topographies.", "In advanced lithography technology, high planarity SOC (Spin-on-Carbon) materials which can planarize topography substrates are required in order to obtain enough process margin. We developed photo curing SOC (P-SOC) materials which can be cross-link by short wavelength UV light, but not thermal process. The P-SOC can achieve high planarization and good via filling because they have high reflow performance without viscosity increasing by baking process and almost no film shrinkage during the baking and photo curing process. The novel P-SOC materials are suitable for very fine pattern manufacturing process as N5 generation which is needed planarization technology.", "In this paper, we report on new polyphenols synthesized by the condensation compounds of phenols and aldehydes. The phenols were 4,4'-biphenol, 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene and 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene. The aldehydes were 4- phenylbenzaldehyde and 4,4'-biphenyldicarbaldehyde. And we evaluated basic properties for the Spin-On Carbon Hardmask [1]. We recognized 4,4'-biphenol was showed good applicability to the best raw material of the phenols for polyphenol, and 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene was showed good applicability to better raw material for polyphenol than 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene. 4,4'-biphenyldicaraldehyde was better raw material of the aldehydes for polyphenols than 4- phenylbenzaldehyde, in solubility. As for heat resistance, 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene was the best raw material of the phenols for polyphenols, 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene was better raw material for polyphenols than 4,4'-biphenol. However, NF7177 synthesized by the condensation of 4,4\u2019-biphenol and 4-phenylbenzaldehyde and NF7A78 synthesized by the condensation of 4,4'-biphenol and 4,4'-biphenyldicarbaldehyde seem to be crosslinking by heating, whence the heat resistance of the polyphenols using 4,4'-biphenol might be improved by optimizing heating condition. These materials are low molecular weight of less than 1000, so we expected having good planarization and gap filling.", "In recent year, the thermal effect has become a critical issue on the operation of memory cell. As heating time or temperature increases, the performances of memory cells are degraded due to its low thermal stabilities. Therefore, processes working at low temperature are necessary not to hurt the thermal stability. In this paper, we introduced LTSOC (Low Temperature Spin-On Carbon), which is believed to minimize the thermal loads because its cross-linker works at low temperature. Also, it would be important to fulfill the needs for the other properties of SOC like filling ability and etching resistance. So, we verified all these basic characteristics with proper resist and etching processes by getting good final pattern profile. As a result, LT-SOC is suggested for etching barrier without affecting on cell operation of memory devices.", "OK73 thinner and cyclohexanone, both of which were spiked with metals were passed through Nylon 6,6 filter, varying flow rate, which include the conditions of both point-of-use and bulk filtrations. The influent and effluent metal concentrations were measured using ICP-MS for metal removal efficiency of the filtration. As a result, removal efficiency for some metals descended depending on the flow rate, while others maintained. Slower flow rate is recommended to maintain low metal concentration in bulk filtration based on the result. Metals in cyclohexanone were reduced at higher efficiency than in OK73 thinner, agrees with a metal removal model of hydrophilic adsorbent in organic solvent, evidenced in our previous paper. Further, metal reduction on 300 mm \u03c6 Si wafer after coating organic solvents with Nylon 6,6 filtration was evidenced with TREX analysis.", "Specific \u201ckiller-defects\u201d, such as micro-line-bridges are one of the key challenges in photolithography\u2019s advanced applications, such as multi-pattern. These defects generate from several sources and are very difficult to eliminate. Pointof-use filtration (POU) plays a crucial role on the mitigation, or elimination, of such defects. Previous studies have demonstrated how the contribution of POU filtration could not be studied independently from photoresists design and track hardware settings. Specifically, we investigated how an effective combination of optimized photoresist, filtration rate, filtration pressure, membrane and device cleaning, and single and multilayer filter membranes at optimized pore size could modulate the occurrence of such defects [1, 2, 3 and 4]. However, the ultimate desired behavior for POU filtration is the selective retention of defect precursor molecules contained in commercially available photoresist. This optimal behavior can be achieved via customized membrane functionalization. Membrane functionalization provides additional non-sieving interactions which combined with efficient size exclusion can selectively capture certain defect precursors. The goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive assessment of membrane functionalization applied on an asymmetric ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UPE) membrane at different pore size. Defectivity transferred in a 45 nm line 55 nm space (45L/55S) pattern, created through 193 nm immersion (193i) lithography with a positive tone chemically amplified resist (PT-CAR), has been evaluated on organic under-layer coated wafers. Lithography performance, such as critical dimensions (CD), line width roughness (LWR) and focus energy matrix (FEM) is also assessed.", "Two versions of a specific 2nm rated filter containing filtration medium and all other components produced from high density polyethylene (HDPE), one subjected to standard cleaning, the other to specialized ultra-cleaning, were evaluated in terms of their cleanliness characteristics, and also defectivity of wafers processed with photoresist filtered through each. With respect to inherent cleanliness, the ultraclean version exhibited a 70% reduction in total metal extractables and 90% reduction in organics extractables compared to the standard clean version. In terms of particulate cleanliness, the ultraclean version achieved stability of effluent particles 30nm and larger in about half the time required by the standard clean version, also exhibiting effluent levels at stability almost 90% lower. In evaluating defectivity of blanket wafers processed with photoresist filtered through either version, initial defect density while using the ultraclean version was about half that observed when the standard clean version was in service, with defectivity also falling more rapidly during subsequent usage of the ultraclean version compared to the standard clean version. Similar behavior was observed for patterned wafers, where the enhanced defect reduction was primarily of bridging defects. The filter evaluation and actual process-oriented results demonstrate the extreme value in using filtration designed possessing the optimal intrinsic characteristics, but with further improvements possible through enhanced cleaning processes", "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV, ~13.5 nm) lithography is the prospective technology for high volume manufacturing by the microelectronics industry. Significant strides towards achieving adequate EUV source power and availability have been made recently, but a limited rate of improvement in photoresist performance still delays the implementation of EUV. Many fundamental questions remain to be answered about the exposure mechanisms of even the relatively well understood chemically amplified EUV photoresists. Moreover, several groups around the world are developing revolutionary metal-based resists whose EUV exposure mechanisms are even less understood. Here, we describe several evaluation techniques to help elucidate mechanistic details of EUV exposure mechanisms of chemically amplified and metal-based resists. EUV absorption coefficients are determined experimentally by measuring the transmission through a resist coated on a silicon nitride membrane. Photochemistry can be evaluated by monitoring small outgassing reaction products to provide insight into photoacid generator or metal-based resist reactivity. Spectroscopic techniques such as thin-film Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy can measure the chemical state of a photoresist system pre- and post-EUV exposure. Additionally, electrolysis can be used to study the interaction between photoresist components and low energy electrons. Collectively, these techniques improve our current understanding of photomechanisms for several EUV photoresist systems, which is needed to develop new, better performing materials needed for high volume manufacturing.", "This talk will describe computational imaging methods for phase retrieval of mask effects, such as electromagnetic edge effects. Our experimental setups employ illumination-side or detection-side coding of angle (Fourier) space with simple hardware. The result is high-resolution intensity and phase images for quantifying mask edge effects. We describe methods for illumination coding Gigapixel microscopy in commercial microscopes and extend our methods to 3D imaging and algorithmic self-calibration. Through an end-to-end design of both the optical system and the computational algorithms, we achieve metrology modalities that are accurate, simple and flexible.", "The next generation technology and emerging memory devices require gradually tighter lithographic focus control on imaging critical layers. Especially in case of BEOL process, big PDO (Process Dependent Offset) from large intra-field topography steps affects the process margin directly. There are couple of scanner options to reduce PDO, such as AGILE which provides several benefits. However, for certain use cases the AGILE sensor may not be the optimal solution.\nIn this paper, we introduce the concept and development background of iFPC (intra-field Finger Print Correction). iFPC is a scanner option that removes the generic 3D fingerprint seen in the leveling data so that both process dependency and actual wafer topography are not followed during wafer exposure.\nIn addition, we compare the degree of process margin improvement when applying iFPC compared to that of AGILE on a critical layer. The achieved results demonstrate that by applying iFPC it is possible to gain an additional 15~20nm DoF. In other words, on this use case our feasibility suggests that by removing the generic 3D fingerprint seen in the leveling data, it is possible to achieve a better focus performance than when trying to follow the topography during scanning.\nIn conclusion, we found another good way to improve the process margin through this comparative experiment. Therefore, our next step will be to setup the methodology to select the use cases where iFPC is the optimal solution.", "Shrinking pattern sizes dictate that scanner-to-scanner variations for HVM products shrink proportionally. This paper shows the ability to identify (a subset of) root causes for mismatch between ArF immersion scanners using scanner metrology. The root cause identification was done in a Samsung HVM factory using a methodology (Proximity Matching Budget Breakdown or PromaBB) developed by ASML. The proper identification of root causes-1 helps to select what combination of scanner control parameters should be used to reduce proximity differences of critical patterns while minimizing undesirable side effects from cross-compensation. Using PromaBB, the difference between predicted and measured CD mismatch was below 0.2nm. PromaBB has been proposed for HVM implementation at Samsung in combination with other ASML fab applications: Pattern Matcher Full Chip (PMFC), Image Tuner and FlexWave.", "With each technology node, overall focus budgets have become increasingly tighter in order to meet the necessary product requirements. The 7nm node has required us to define new opportunities for addressing top contributors to the focus budget. Field curvature in particular has been identified as a key contributor to the intrafield focus budget, contributing around 50%. This paper will introduce two new methodologies for improving field curvature; one a hardware solution and one a software solution.", "The Global 450mm Consortium (G450C), which is located at the SUNY Poly campus in Albany, NY was created to develop and evaluate a manufacturing tool set for 450mm wafers. The Lithography cell at G450C consists of a Nikon NSR-S650D 193nm immersion scanner and a SCREEN SOKUDO DUO DT-4000 track. The Lithography cell was installed and qualified in 2015, and with over a year of tool availability we have been able to perform extensive testing on the system to determine the equipment readiness for volume manufacturing. For the purposes of this paper we are focusing on the Edge Placement Error (EPE) [1] contributors of Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU) and Overlay [2]. We will show the initial results as well as the improvements that have been made since tool acceptance. The 450mm results will be compared to 300mm tools in production today, as well as against the seven nanometer node (N7) expected requirements. Lastly, we plan to demonstrate the Nikon scanner\u2019s ability for focus control on stressed or bowed wafers, which are characteristic challenges of large silicon substrates. This paper will showcase the current 450mm lithography performance for CDU on both Line/Space (LS) and Contact Hole (CH) patterns. We will demonstrate the process window for LS and CH features on multiple resists specially formulated for 450mm. Both Post Exposure Bake (PEB) tuning on the SCREEN track as well as CDU Master (CDUM) Corrections from the Nikon Turnkey Solution software suite will be utilized for performance improvements on 450mm wafers. The G450C goal is to drive CDU down to less than 1nm 3\u03c3 across the entire wafer with 1.5mm edge exclusion zone.\u201d In addition to our test masks, G450C has designed a three layer mask set and with these masks we gathered \u201con product\u201d CDU performance on a Back End Of Line (BEOL) metal stack. In the current reality of high volume manufacturing, multi-patterning is used to achieve the required Critical Dimension (CD) and pitch combination. The largest contributor to EPE is scanner overlay performance. We will demonstrate the Single Machine Overlay (SMO) performance as well as some Mix and Match Overlay (MMO) results. The lithography cell at G450C is the only 450mm linked lithography cell in the world. In order to create MMO wafers we were required to expose the first print at the Nikon factory in Japan and etch them at G450C to generate an align-to layer. As the wafers\u2019 size scales, so do some of the process effects including film stress and wafer bow. The current G450C BEOL integrated process has measured wafer bow of up to 350um. We will demonstrate how the S650D measures the wafer topography and adjusts the exposure to compensate for wafer bow.", "Fifteen years has passed since ArF lithography technology transitioned to mass production. At first the node size was 130nm, however, now we are discussing one-digit nm node. This node size is one-fifteenth compared to that in the initial generation. It is obvious that generations have steadily changed. Meanwhile, ArF projection optics has been designed with higher NA. Moreover, much higher NA or effectively short wavelength have been achieved by introducing the immersion lithography technology which injects immersion media between the light emission side of optics and the wafer surface. Now that ten years has passed since the immersion lithography technology transitioned to mass production, the requirements for the light source have become much more demanding. This is because E95%, a typical parameter for the light source, which reduces the CD variation and influences the optical characteristics, has been required to be much shorter along with advanced node. The spectrum characteristics of the conventional KrF 248nm-light source were defined with full-width at half maximum (FWHM). After entering ArF era, E95% was defined as more stringent parameter. This new parameter is closely linked to line narrowing and node transition. This E95% is a parameter to define optics monochromaticity and recognized as equivalent to quantified chromatic aberration. More specifically, it is desired to reduce the chromatic aberration ideally down to zero to maximize the contrast by suppressing blur images. Provided that the blur images are caused by not only chromatic aberration but also the convoluted effect of spherical aberration, residual errors of lithography optics system and other defocus elements. In line with this we should take persistent challenges to reduce errors in designing and manufacturing lithography optics systems and drive the chromatic aberration closer to zero. The contrast we discuss in the lithography optics systems strongly correlate to resolution, and thus it is well known that OPC bias is linear with respect to E95% when the resolution is fixed. Although this OPC bias and E95% have been firmly linear with each other, it has also been revealed that the trend of the linearity with much shorter E95% deviates from the conventional trend and shows an inflection point in the near future. We systematically analyze the trend that linearity error tends to be greater than the conventional distribution and suggest solutions to the issue. This systematic analysis includes: 1. Measurement errors and distribution in measuring E95% as the spectrum width 2. Correlation between raw measured spectrum intensity data and E95% 3. Linearity comparison in behaviors between when E95% is approximated by i) +/-2 sigma of, ii)+/-3 sigma of normal spectrum distribution, and iii) by another approximation. Based on these studies, we identify the roles of the light source to contribute to 7nm-node mass production by defining the spectrum and its requirements for lithography performance.", "Figure would be provided Figure 1 shows that the most important factor in lithography is foot contrast. Low contrast leaves a large region (CAT) where resist solubility is uncertain (chaotic area), which causes unresolvable patterns, LER/LWR issues, and pattern collapse (collapse may be due to affinity imbalance). Figure 2 shows examples of a CAT plot for two stacks of low optical reflectivity and high optical foot contrast. Low reflectivity gives higher CAT, and is further deteriorated as the image approaches the forbidden pitch, while a high foot contrast stack keeps good CAT value across all pitches. Experimental results agree well with the calculations, which will be included in the full paper. Figure 3 is a CAT contour map versus resist and Si-HM thickness for a L/P=40/100 nm pattern. Additional CAT plots will be included in the full paper. Figure 1. Optical distribution of a 40-nm dense line cross-section and resist contrast curve for CAT calculation. Figure 2. CAT plots comparing two stacks, low reflectivity and high foot contrast Figure 3. CAT contour map versus resist and Si-HM thickness.", "Simulation of negative tone development (NTD) resist has become a challenge for physical resist modeling. Traditionally, resist modeling was mainly limited to reaction-diffusion models for post exposure bake (PEB) and standard development rate models for simulating the pattern formation during the final development step. With some minor extensions, this simulation approach sufficiently predicted resist CDs and resist profile shapes that were in agreement with experimental data.3 For the latest NTD resists, this situation has changed. In contrast to positive tone development (PTD) resists, resist shrinkage is strongly impacting resist profile shapes. Furthermore, NTD resists induce strong proximity effects that require consideration of additional chemical resist properties in modeling and model calibration. In this paper we experimentally characterize and model the main properties of NTD photo-resists.", "The effects of photoresist sidewall profile and LER on two representative integration schemes were studied through 3D virtual fabrication: Front-End of Line (FEOL) Fin formation and Back-End of Line (BEOL) Metal line definition. Both of these processes use self-aligned double patterning (SADP) in pattern definition, and affect the circuit performance through MOSFET channel shape and parasitic capacitance respectively. In both cases we imposed LER and sidewall roughness on the photoresist that defines the mandrel at the initial step of the SADP flow using SEMulator3D. The LER followed a Gaussian correlation function for a number of amplitude and correlation length values. The sidewall profile emulated the bulb-shaped pattern that is reported in experimental works. The taper angle and roughness amplitude of this shape were varied to isolate its components. In each of these cases, we have found direct evidence of resist sidewall profile impact on variability degradation in CD and electrical performance. Special care should be placed on controlling resist profile through optimization of exposure and development schemes.", "With shrinking design rules, the overall patterning requirements are getting aggressively tighter and tighter. For the 5-nm node and beyond, on-product overlay below 2.5nm is required. Achieving such performance levels will not only need optimization of scanner performance but a holistic tuning of all process steps. In previous work, it has been shown that process-induced pattern asymmetry has significant impact on overlay performance at wafer edge and can be partially compensated by applying high-order scanner corrections or optimizing metrology targets. Today, we present the reduction of process-induced pattern asymmetry in a tunable etch system and demonstrate the related on-product overlay improvement combined with scanner corrections.\nIn our work we utilize etch tools (Lam Kiyo\u00ae conductor etch systems) with proprietary edge tuning technology that can be used to reduce the etch-related asymmetry at the wafer edge. In combination to this unique method, we evaluate the impact of high order corrections per exposure field to compensate for process asymmetry at the wafer edge with a state-of-the-art 1.35 NA immersion scanner (NXT:1970Ci).\nThe study is done on dedicated test wafers with 10-nm logic node design. We use angle-resolved scatterometry (YieldStar\u00ae S-250), atomic force microscopy, and SEM cross-sections to characterize process asymmetry. We present experimental investigation of the effect of etch tuning and scanner corrections on the pattern shift and the resulting overlay. In particular, we present results showing a reduction of etch-induced pattern shift by 12nm at wafer radius 147mm.\nResults show that asymmetry can be addressed by both, litho compensation and etch tuning, and bring on-product overlay down to the required level. We discuss the benefit of the correction techniques especially for thick hard mask layers (the pattern shift scales linear with hard mask thickness) and evaluate a combined correction scenario, where preventive etch tuning and feed-back based scanner corrections are used. We conclude that a holistic tuning of all process steps will be required to fulfill overlay requirements of future nodes.", "Successful patterning requires good control of the photolithography and etch processes. While compact litho models, mainly based on rigorous physics, can predict very well the contours printed in photoresist, pure empirical etch models are less accurate and more unstable. Compact etch models are based on geometrical kernels to compute the litho-etch biases that measure the distance between litho and etch contours. The definition of the kernels as well as the choice of calibration patterns is critical to get a robust etch model. This work proposes to define a set of independent and anisotropic etch kernels designed to capture the finest details of the resist contours and represent precisely any etch bias. By evaluating the etch kernels on various structures it is possible to map their etch signatures in a multi-dimensional space and analyze them to find an optimal sampling of structures to train an etch model. The method was specifically applied to a contact layer containing many different geometries and was used to successfully select appropriate calibration structures. The proposed kernels evaluated on these structures were combined to train an etch model significantly better than the standard one.", "Various multi-patterning processes with associated design methodologies have been deployed to address patterning challenges of ArFi and alternate solutions such as EUV, DSA or nanoimprint. Process variability prediction through compact models is sometimes limited to those multipatterning processes used to compose single final target. We may call those sequential processes as representative module for design target layer which is not clearly derived from single litho-etch process but derived from the interaction between various layers. Key challenges for extending multiple pattering are managing design and tolerance variation in multiple pattering steps with proper restrictions, and visualizing interlayer errors (w/ bridge & pinch and overlap). Additionally,visualization of final target layers and intermediate layers is important for process/design engineers.\n\nWe will demonstrate verification flows for different process modules to verify the failure mechanisms and to aid in visualization, then judge the areas for improvement with existing model based solutions. Then we will also try to investigate possible area for development of accurate residual error prediction from compact models as those errors are accumulated from multiple process effects into final CD measurement from design target layers. This may lead to new dimensions of modeling process effects we\u2019ve never considered because those signatures were lumped between processes to processes.", "Lithography simulation is an essential technique for today's semiconductor manufacturing process. In order to calculate an entire chip in realistic time, compact resist model is commonly used. The model is established for faster calculation. To have accurate compact resist model, it is necessary to fix a complicated non-linear model function. However, it is difficult to decide an appropriate function manually because there are many options. This paper proposes a new compact resist model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) which is one of deep learning techniques. CNN model makes it possible to determine an appropriate model function and achieve accurate simulation. Experimental results show CNN model can reduce CD prediction errors by 70% compared with the conventional model.", "In this paper we introduce an inverse lithography technology (ILT) solution that provides masks with perfect symmetry and minimal complexity. In this solution we divide the ILT problem into three steps and strictly maintain symmetry in each of these steps. First, we optimize an ideal grayscale mask. Second, we seed this ideal mask with polygons. Finally, we grow these seeds in a separate optimization flow. The final mask perfectly maintains the symmetry properties of the illumination source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ILT solution that can be used on the original design hierarchy on a full chip scale.", "Most pattern shift analysis discussions focus on the accuracy of the Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) model that forms the pattern contours, while the OPC model\u2019s source itself is considered as a constant input to the model. In reality, the source might have defects or contaminations that can impact the image formation and possibly introduce asymmetrical pattern formation behavior. Initial studies have quantified the impact of source defects on wafer CDs in the presence of OPC [1]. These studies have found that when source defects are present in the OPC model CD variation, NILS impact, MEEF impact, and pattern shifts might occur. Empirical studies and data have shown that the severity of defects are proportional to the impact on final pattern formation. However, it should also be noted that optical proximity correction schemes have been found to be a robust ally in countering the aforementioned defects in imaging.\nThis study is a continuation of the previous work of source imperfection impacts on optical proximity correction to better understand the interaction between source defects and pattern shift during mask synthesis. Two variations of the study are executed: the first variation is the mask error case where random intensity variations are introduced in the pixelated source and an OPC model is created, then the corrected pattern is imaged with an ideal source. The second variation is the exposure error case where the OPC correction is performed with an ideal source, then exposed with a random defect in the manufacturing source. For both cases a pixel transmission variation is introduced in pixelated source using 11 various pixel selection methodology. Each experiment for the mask and exposure defects are conducted five times. This aims to quantify the effects on pattern uniformity while assuming defects in source manufacturing. This also allows you to better understand the limitation of scanner systems that might not be able to 100% represent the source pixels that were created during an aggressive Source Mask Optimization (SMO) session. Detailed analysis and studies are conducted to quantify the source defects impact on pattern formation.", "DUV immersion lithography (ArFi) continues to be the primary lithographic method for semiconductor manufacturers. Use of ArFi lithography requires patterning budget improvements in the range of 1/10 nm especially for interconnect layers[1] ; for advanced process technology nodes, every Angstrom counts. Previous investigations into the effects of light source bandwidth on imaging performance have provided the foundation for this work[2-10]. This study will focus on the increase in image contrast that 200 fm light source E95 bandwidth enables on Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) and Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) features. The impact of 200 fm E95 bandwidth on the CD and Edge Placement Error (EPE) performance of core (grating) and block features will be assessed using an imec 7 nm process node test vehicle. The on wafer experimental results will be compared with the simulation predicted responses of the target features to lower light source bandwidth.", "Sub-Resolution Assist Feature (SRAF) printing is a critical yield detractor and known issue in OPC technology. SRAF print avoidance models can be used to determine where undesirable printing is likely to occur, but such models lack the necessary robustness and reliability for the detection of all SRAF printing cases. Classification of printing SRAFs is a subjective and manual task where many engineering hours are spent. In this work we demonstrate a reliable way to accurately classify images according to SRAF printing risk. Testing multiple sets of data, across multiple processes, yielded a prediction success rate of 97% wherein only a single image was under-predicted. Under-prediction is when a model fails to predict printing SRAFs; a key defect generator, as it means the model will not be able to remove the SRAF shape in the OPC iteration before mask build. We propose a new methodology as to accurately auto-classify and filter images with SRAF printing on wafer. This scalable solution will improve the quality and reliability of SRAF print avoidance models and reduce the risk of printing SRAF by removing the manual, highly subjective, image classification step.", "A new form of image decomposition is derived that uses compound systems to target critical TCC components while at the same time providing the usual least-squares optimal match to the TCC as a whole. Significant improvements in accuracy under a given runtime budget are obtained by intensively correcting those portions of the TCC which are most recalcitrant to the standard coherent decomposition used in OPC today (e.g. SOCS or OCS). In particular, the non-coherent structure of our new decomposition systems is well-suited to extract any near-Toeplitz components present in the spatial-domain TCC. Such components are difficult to capture with coherent decomposition, and we show that TCCs for lithographic systems in fact contain strong Toeplitz-like components that arise from slope discontinuities associated with the sharp aperture of the projection lens. 1D tests show that for a given kernel-count budget in the typical e.g. 10-100 range, image calculation error can routinely be reduced by at least 5X if our new systems are included in the decomposition.", "New inverse methods such as model-based SRAF placement, model-based SRAF optimization, and full main + assist feature ILT are well known to have considerable benefits in finding flexible mask pattern solutions to improve process window and CD control. These methods have traditionally relied on compact models that are tuned to match resist measurements at a single z-height or slice. At this slice in the resist, some critical failure modes such as top loss and scumming are not detected. In this paper, we describe and present results for a methodology to extend ILT\u2019s process window improvement capabilities, and to co-optimize mask patterns with awareness of the resist profile. These improvements are proven to reduce the risk of patterning failures at the bottom and top of critical resist features, which a typical mask correction process would not alleviate. Ideally, mask optimization would use a full rigorous TCAD resist model to guide the correction at multiple heights in the resist. However, TCAD models are significantly slower than compact models in simulations and ILT already has high computational requirements. Therefore, we have generated compact models which are fitted to the TCAD model resist profile data. We show the significant process window improvements obtained with this new resist 3D aware ILT methodology.", "State-of-the-art OPC recipes for production semiconductor manufacturing are fine-tuned, often artfully crafted parameter sets are designed to achieve design fidelity and maximum process window across the enormous variety of patterns in a given design level. In the typical technology lifecycle, the process for creating a recipe is iterative. In the initial stages, very little to no \u201creal\u201d design content is available for testing. Therefore, an engineer may start with the recipe from a previous node; adjust it based on known ground rules and a few test patterns and/or scaled designs, and then refine it based on hardware results. As the technology matures, more design content becomes available to refine the recipe, but it becomes more difficult to make major changes without significantly impacting the overall technology scope and schedule. The dearth of early design information is a major risk factor: unforeseen patterning difficulties (e.g. due to holes in design rules) are costly when caught late.\nTo mitigate this risk, we propose an automated flow that is capable of producing large-scale realistic design content, and then optimizing the OPC recipe parameters to maximize the process window for this layout. The flow was tested with a triple-patterned 10nm node 1X metal level. First, design-rule clean layouts were produced with a tool called Layout Schema Generator (LSG). Next, the OPC recipe was optimized on these layouts, with a resulting reduction in the number of hotspots. For experimental validation, the layouts were placed on a test mask, and the predicted hotspots were compared with hardware data.", "We demonstrate a fundamental paradigm shift in microoptics manufacturing. Using femtosecond two-photon 3D printing with 100 nm spatial resolution, the time from lens design and structural assembly layout to manufacturing and optical testing can be reduced to less than 24 hours. Even complex microscope objectives with multiple aspherical and non rotationally symmetric freeform surfaces can be manufactured. We demonstrate diffraction limited performance and MTF measurements across a large field of view of such systems that can be as small as only 100 \u00b5m in diameter, directly fabricated onto the ends of optical fiber tips. Other applications such as phase shapers or miniaturized illumination systems are also presented.", "Laser Direct Write Lithography (LDWL) is a serial maskless lithography technique where a focused laser beam is scanned through a photoresist. We present a simulation flow for LDWL that includes focusing of Gaussian beams, free radical polymerization chemistry of the resist, and photoresist development. The developed simulation flow was applied to analyze the results of an experiment where laser direct write lithography is combined with Nanoimprint lithography. Specifically, we investigate the root causes of experimental observations on the improvement of the process performance by sub-division of the total exposure dose into several discrete writing cycles, which are separated in time. In addition, the developed modeling approach is used to investigate innovative laser write methods: two photon absorption (TPA), stimulated emission depletion (STED) lithography, and quencher diffusion assisted lithography.", "We analyzed the field contrast, aspect ratio, pattern uniformity as well as the line-edge roughness (LER) of the patterns fabricated in plasmonic lithography. Deep subwavelength patterns with high aspect-ratio and large-area uniformity were achieved by coupling the evanescent waves into an optical waveguide as well as the selection of a single high spatial frequency mode. In addition, the impacts of defects on photomasks and the surface roughness on thin films are studied in two exemplary plasmonic lithography systems: superlens and hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM). Superlens is capable of replicating arbitrary patterns, which also inherently make it vulnerable to roughness of the thin film and imperfections on the mask; while HMM system is more immune to such imperfections due to its spatial frequency selection function property.", "Plasmonics based photolithography has been able to achieve pattern size beyond the typical diffraction limit by exploiting the surface plasmon (SP) [1]. However, film roughness is inevitable in practical fabrication, and can strongly impact the performance of the lithography. In our work, exemplary lithography systems including superlens and hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) based approaches are considered, where the effects of films roughness and the defects on the mask are analyzed systematically. For the superlens system, a chromium (Cr) mask with thickness of 50 nm and period of 90 nm on glass substrate, is placed above the superlens with a poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) spacer layer. A silver (Ag) film with thickness of 20 nm transmits the transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light with wavelength 365 nm the photoresist (PR) film with thickness of 40 nm. A reflector composed of an Ag film with thickness of 50 nm is added at the bottom of the PR. For the HMM system, Cr mask is used with period of 360 nm and the multi-layer structure is composed with 9 layers of 15 nm thick aluminum (Al) and 30 nm thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) films. The PR is also 40 nm and reflector film is an Al film with thickness of 50 nm. The broad optical transfer function (OTF) of the smooth Ag enables the evanescent waves of wide wave vector range to pass through [2]. While the OTF of HMM shows that only \u00b12nd order diffraction waves with the wave vector about 2k_0 can pass through [3]. Different degrees of roughness are introduced on the films and the photomask, and the performance of the two systems in terms of the intensity, pattern uniformity and line edge roughness are compared. As the roughness of the films grows, the OTF of the superlens degrades dramatically, while the OTF of the HMM maintains, as shown Figure 1 and 2. Accordingly, the field distribution of the HMM system is less affected by the film roughness, thereby can still produce high quality periodic patterns. By properly choosing the period of the mask, the desired transmission order coincides with the peak of the OTF function. Therefore, the light of desired spatial frequency transmits maximally, while the other diffraction orders induced by the rough surfaces is relatively suppressed, leading to a pattern with better uniformity. On the other hand, the superlens case does not offer such a utility because of the broad transmission function in OTF. But superlens can image arbitrary patterns; while the drawback is that line-edge roughness of the mask will also be imaged onto the photoresist. Therefore, the impact of a single defect on the mask pattern is much greater than that of the HMM approach. In addition, the waveguide lithography system consists of aluminum (Al) layers acting as a filter shows similar behavior compared with that of the HMM system. Though the structure is almost identical to the superlens structure, but the thin metal film serves a very different function in this case, which confirms the distinctive advantage of the frequency selective scheme. Meanwhile, our simulation shows Al can be a good superlens at 193 nm, which indicates that the same metal can function differently in different schemes or wavelengths.", "We investigated the fabrication of small neuroelectronic device consisting of four shanks with 16 electrodes per shank for simultaneous neurochemical and brain activity monitoring. The 16 electrodes on each shank have a separation distance of 100 microns (\u03bcm). Each shank has a width of 40 \u03bcm with separation distance of 7750 \u03bcm. This design eliminates single-site recording with limited individual conductors and permits rapid characterization of multiple neurons simultaneously at multiple brain depth/sites, consequently providing ground-breaking capabilities for parsing neurochemical release and brain activity. The device is fabricated on (100) silicon substrate and is fully integrated with electrode, interconnect and bond pad fabricated on one chip. Gold rectangular pyramid electrodes are selected as the recording electrodes to enhance the non-invasiveness associated with heating and minimizing surrounding biological tissue damage. The gold electrodes are deposited on the etched silicon substrate with 600 nanometer (nm) low temperature oxide (LTO) sacrificial layer. Each electrode has top area of 6 \u03bcm x 60 \u03bcm and depth of 750 \u03bcm. The interconnects provide electrical connection between electrodes and bond pads and are sandwiched between thin polyimide layers to prevent them from breaking while maintaining the flexibility. Final bond pads and electrodes are all passivated with polyimide to provide mechanical support. Upon device release, the recording electrodes are exposed to directly contact brain structure, and the exposed bond pads are soldered on the circuit board to transport signals to the measurement instrument. The entire process involves five photomasks. Process development and integration challenges will be reviewed and discussed in the paper.", "Previous studies have quantified the impact of source error on wafer CDs in the presence of OPC. The studies found that when a 100% emitting source error is introduced into the OPC model, the corrected mask is minimally impacted through process when small errors are introduced on the source. However, as slightly larger errors are placed on the source used in the OPC mode, catastrophic failures are found. When the same errors are introduced to the exposure source when the mask is corrected with a perfect source, there is a significant through process CD variation in the system but there are no clearly catastrophic failures.\nThe present study continues beyond the initial work to better understand the interaction between source errors and OPC. In this case, partial transmission and zero transmission errors are introduced into the study. The initial study found a CD bias and extra CD variation when the error was located in the transmissive area for the source error case. As the result of a previous study, these effects are thought to be due to scattered background illumination and pattern shift, respectively. These effects were not as readily observed in the mask error case. This study looks at the interaction of different errors in the source during both exposure and OPC generation to better understand the effects of source errors on the final pattern.\nA resulting analysis of study is presented. The analysis explains whether scattered background illumination and pattern shift are the mechanisms of the source effects. This can be concluded if the same effects can be generated in the mask error case using various source errors. The software methodology used to execute these studies is presented in detail.", "The appropriate representation of the photomask in the simulation of wafer lithography processes has been shown to be of vital importance for 14-nm and below [1]. This task is difficult, since accurate optical metrology and physical metrology of the three-dimensional mask structure is not always available. OPC models for wafer patterning comprise representations of the mask, the optics, and the photoresist process. The traditional calibration of these models has involved empirical tuning of model parameters to CD-SEM data from printed photoresist patterns. Such a flow necessarily convolves the resist effects and it has been difficult to reliably obtain mask and optical parameters which are most representative of physical reality due to aliasing effects. In this work, we have undertaken to decouple the mask model from the photoresist process by use of the ZEISS Wafer-Level CD (WLCD) tool based upon aerial image metrology. By measuring the OPC test pattern mask with WLCD, the mask parameters in the OPC model can be tuned directly without interference of resist effects. This work utilized 14-nm,10-nm, and 7-nm node masks, and we demonstrate that the use of such a flow leads to the most predictive overall OPC models, and that the mask parameters resulting from this flow more closely match the expected physical values. More specifically, the mask corner rounding, sidewall angle, and bias values were tuned to the WLCD data instead of the wafer CD SEM data, and resulted in improved predictive capability of the model. Furthermore, other mask variables not traditionally tuned can be verified or tuned by matching simulation to aerial image metrology.", "The extension of optical lithography to 7 nm node and beyond relies heavily on multiple litho-etch patterning technologies. The etch processes in multiple patterning often require progressively large bias differences between litho and etch as the target features become smaller. Moreover, since this litho-etch bias has strong pattern dependency, it must be taken into consideration during the Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) processes. Traditionally, two approaches are used to compensate etch biases: rule-based retargeting and model-based retargeting. The rule-based approach has a turn-around-time advantage but now has challenges meeting the increasingly tighter critical dimension (CD) requirements using a reasonable etch-bias table, especially for complex 2D patterns. Alternatively, model-based retargeting can meet these CD requirements by capturing the etch process physics with high accuracy, including the etch bias variability that arises from both patterning proximity effects and etch chamber non-uniformity. In the past, empirical terms have been used to approximate the etch bias due to pattern proximity effects but sometimes empirical models are known to have compromised model accuracy so a physical based approach is desired. This paper\u2019s work will address the etch bias variability due to patterning proximity effects by using a physical approach based simplified chemical kinetics. It starts from a well calibrated After-Development-Inspection (ADI) model and the subsequent etch model is based on the ADI model contour. By assuming that plasma chemical species in the trenches are maintained in an equilibrium state, the plasma species act on the edges to induce etch bias. Methods are developed to evaluate plasma collision probability on trench edges for random layouts. Furthermore, the impact of resist materials on etch bias are treated with Arrhenius equation or as a second order reaction. Equations governing plasma collision probabilities on trench edges as a function of time are derived. An etch bias model can be calibrated based on those equations. Experimental results have shown that this physical approach to model etch bias is a promising direction to applications for full-chip etch proximity corrections.", "The layout design for silicon photonics can be complicated and usually have edges with arbitrary angles. The critical dimension can be less than 100 nm, requiring the layouts to be OPCed in order to have large enough process windows for high volume manufacturing. However, the well-established CMOS-orientated IC industry OPC tools for advanced nodes can only handle Manhattan designs in which the Manhattan style polygons with edges of 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 or 45\u00b0 to the reference direction. Silicon photonics layouts need to be discretized in order to use the existing OPC tools. From optical performance point of view, the design grid is expected to be as small as possible and it is usually from 1 nm to 5 nm. However, the design grid has never been optimized based on the OPC performance. In this paper, we demonstrate the impacts of design grid on the OPC performance. Design grid for silicon photonics is not always the smaller the better anymore. Our study shows that small 2D designs require large design grids while smooth curves with large radius require small design grids. We proposed a novel design-based discretization algorithm to convert a non-Manhattan style layout to an OPC-friendly Manhattan style layout. Simulation results show that the pattern fidelity is optimized for both small 2D patterns and smooth curves.", "Si-Photonics is the technology in which data is transferred by photons (i. e. light). On a Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC), light is processed and routed on a chip by means of optical waveguides. The Si-Photonics waveguides functionality is determined by its geometrical design which is commonly curved, skew and non-Manhattan. That is why printing fidelity is very challenging on photonics patterns.\nIn this paper, we present two different Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) flows for Si-Photonics patterning. The first flow is regular model based OPC and the second one is based on Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT). The first OPC flow needs first to retarget the input layout while the ILT flow does support skew edges input by tool design and does not need any retargeting step before OPC. We will compare these two flows on various Si- Photonics waveguides from lithography quality, run time and MRC compliance of mask output. We will observe that ILT flow gives the best Edge Placement Error (EPE) and the lowest ripples along the devices. The ILT flow also takes into account the mask rules so that the generated mask is mask rule compliant (MRC). We will also discuss the silicon wafer data where Si-Photonics devices are printed within the two different OPC flows at process window conditions. Finally, for both OPC flows, we will present the total OPC run time which is acceptable in an industrial environment.", "Multiple exposure patterning is now a main-stream method used in the manufacturing of modern integrated circuits.1 However, the overlay statistics of these multiple exposure schemes has not been well understood. Splitting levels into multiple exposures (2x, 3x, etc. patterning) has a quantifiable effect on how overlay metrology relates to overlay process assumptions and capability. In addition, overlay metrology strategies used to measure a current layer back to a layer exposed with multiple exposures can also misrepresent the true overlay error. In this paper we look statistically at the effect of multiple exposures on the actual overlay error and compare it to that measured with overlay metrology.\n\nProcess assumptions (PAs) typically document the requirements between a current layer and a prior layer.2 With single exposure layers the process assumption for overlay error of a current layer to a prior layer could be set knowing an exposure tool\u2019s on product overlay capability, error sources for the layers involved, maximum acceptable rework rate and yield-loss the fab was able to accept. For a current layer that minimizes back to a prior layer that was exposed with multiple exposures, there are new sources of error to understand and consider.3 Understanding how these process assumptions relate to the capability of simple single layer to single layer overlay is desirable. This paper takes a new approach to calculating these relationships by using image-placement error and population statistics. This is different than former methods discussed in the literature that look at \u201c2nd order\u201d overlay calculations. We show that base single layer to single layer process capability needs to be tighter than process assumption of a current layer minimizing back to multiple prior layers with the specific amount of tightening directly related to the mean overlay error between multipatterned layers. Because of this, mean overlay specifications have to be set appropriately at prior layers to match process assumptions. As an example, if a contact layer is split into two exposures, the mean translation error between the two exposures needs to be minimized for good metal to contact overlay. This paper will describe the exact controls needed based on the new statistical understanding.\n\nSetting ground-rules based on overlay PAs that are correctly determined, using the image placement and population statistics, is critical. Without the proper statistical understanding, it can be concluded that single layer to single layer overlay capability cannot support a technology using multiple exposures, resulting in increased die areas as ground-rules are relaxed for 2nd order calculations incorrectly applied to the problem. Of course, the opposite is true if control of the mean overlay error of prior layers cannot be adequately controlled.\n\nThrough statistical analysis, we show that grouped overlay metrology of multiple exposures underestimates the true overlay error. This is due to the point-by-point averaging of layers that have been split into multiple exposures. Fortunately, the ratio between metrology and true overlay can be exactly calculated.", "For the sub-20 nm DRAM nodes, wafer-to-wafer (W2W) variation is one of the major contributors to on-product overlay (OPO). One way to reduce the W2W variation is by applying overlay corrections on wafer level on top of per lot / per chuck corrections. These overlay corrections can e.g. be based on measurements of the OPO on the wafers to be corrected prior to rework and re-exposure. Measuring OPO on every wafer is not preferred due to the resulting metrology cost increase. Hence, wafers are typically assigned to a limited amount of groups, which are in turn assigned one common correction set for all the wafers within a particular group. The common corrections are obtained from measuring wafers from the respective groups. In this paper, we present results obtained by a different approach, where the wafer grouping is deduced from metrology data that is available prior to the exposure of the lot. Aim of this approach is to balance overlay control and OPO metrology effort. We experimentally demonstrated the benefit of our approach on one of the critical layers of a sub-20 nm DRAM product of SK hynix. The experiment was executed in a rework scenario, which involves exposing and measuring OPO on selected send-ahead (SAHD) wafers, their subsequent rework, and re-exposure of the full lot using per-group corrections derived from the OPO measurements of the SAHDs. The results of this experiment indicate a promising OPO improvement. Simulations performed on additional lots and for 3 additional layers confirm the validity of our results.", "In advanced technological nodes, the photoresist absorbs light, which is reflected by underlying topography during optical lithography of implantation layers. Anti-reflective coating (ARC) helps to suppress the reflections, but ARC removal may damage transistors, not to mention its relatively high cost. Therefore ARC is usually not used, and topography modeling becomes obligatory for printing implantation shapes. Furthermore, presence of Fin Field Effect Transistors (FinFETs) makes modeling of non-uniform substrate reflections exceptionally challenging.\nIn realistic designs, the same implantation shape may be found in a vertical or in a rotated horizontal orientation. This creates two types of relationships between the critical dimension (CD) and FinFET, namely parallel to and perpendicular to the fins. The measurement data shows that CDs differ between these two orientations. This discrepancy is also revealed by our Rigorous Optical Topography simulator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the shape orientation may introduce CD differences of up to 45 nm with a 248 nm illumination for 14 nm technology. These differences are highly dependent on the enclosure (distance between implantation shape and active area). One of the major causes of the differences is that in the parallel orientation the shape is facing solid sidewalls of fins, while the perpendicular oriented shape \u201csees\u201d only perforated sidewalls of the fin structure, which reflect much less energy.\nMeticulously stated numerical experiments helped us to thoroughly understand anisotropic behavior of CD measurement. This allowed us to more accurately account for FinFET-related topography effects in the compact implantation modeling for optical proximity corrections (OPC). This improvement is validated against wafer measurement data.", "The final lithography accuracy is determined by what is known as the \u201con-product\u201d performance, which includes product wafer-related errors and long-term stability. It is evident that on-product performance improvement is absolutely imperative now, and will become even more crucial in coming years. In order to meet customers\u2019 future requirements, we have developed the next-generation lithography system focusing on wafer alignment advancements to improve onproduct performance.\n\nThis newly developed wafer alignment system will help customers achieve their aggressive next-generation manufacturing accuracy and productivity requirements. In this paper, we describe the details of the new wafer measurement system and provide supporting performance data.", "Scanners in High-Volume-Manufacturing conditions will experience a large range of reticles that vary in reticle transmission and reticle diffraction characteristics. Especially under full production loads reticles will heat up due to the exposure light-load and as such experience thermo-mechanical deformations. The resulting reticle pattern distortion can be partially translated in a deteriorated overall system overlay. Due to the geometry of the reticle and exposure fields, these reticle thermal effects are in general barrel-shape distortions that can be well corrected with the available set of lens manipulators. Nevertheless node-over-node the residual overlay errors associated with thermo-mechanical reticle deformation needs further reduction since it contributes to the total onproduct overlay performance. To reduce overlay caused by reticle temperature drift, NXT1980Di includes an active cooling mechanism suppressing the reticle temperature changes during exposure significantly. Even though the reticle temperature excursions are well suppressed, residual intra-wafer overlay drift effect can still be observed. Before exposure of a wafer, reticle deformation is measured during reticle align using in-line alignment / image sensors (TIS or PARIS). This is enabled by adding alignment markers around the circumference of the image field on the reticle. The measured reticle deformations are then fed to the system control network and dynamically corrected for by making use of the available manipulators in the scanner and the projection lens. Wafer-by-wafer reticle distortion measurements are performed to accurately capture the transient dynamics present in reticle heating during normal production lots. A new version of Reticle Heating Feed-forward Control (RHC2) is introduced that uses reticle-heating-induced deformation measurements over time and exposure sequence information to calibrate reticle-deformation-predictionmodels. These models are based on thermo-mechanical models that simulate reticle deformation under various exposure conditions and are applied in-line to the exposures to reduce intra-wafer overlay drift effects.", "Multi-patterning techniques with ArF immersion lithography continue to be extended into the 10 and 7 nm nodes. With increasingly challenging process control requirements (CD, overlay, edge placement error), the lithography and patterning tools need to find ways to minimize variation and maintain process margin to achieve high yields. This paper will describe new advances in light source technologies that can regain imaging margins by optimizing light source bandwidth settings in concert with OPC retargeting to take advantage of the contrast improvements1,2 afforded by lower bandwidth. In addition to simulation studies reported previously3,4, on-wafer measurements were collected showing the progressive improvements gained with lowering bandwidth on an existing mask as well as reoptimizing a mask to leverage this lower bandwidth setting. To fully leverage this capability, further improvements in bandwidth stability are going to be featured on a new ArF light source along with an integrated solution that allows the bandwidth target to be commanded by scanner recipe. This will allow lithographers to optimize layers that need further improvements in patterning by using lower bandwidth while continuing to run existing layers with standard, 300 fm bandwidth targets. With the introduction of a new DUV light source, this paper will also describe improvements that continue to reduce running costs in an effort to counteract the escalating costs of multi-patterning lithography.", "Multiple patterning ArF immersion lithography has been expected as the promising technology to meet tighter leading edge device requirements. The most needed features for the next generation lasers are improvement of device yield, the prevention against rare resource shortage and the reduction of operational costs in multiple-patterning lithography [1] [2]. To support these requirements, GT65A provides the functions of tighter E95 bandwidth stability, lower E95 bandwidth and tunable E95 bandwidth to enhance chip yields [3] [4]. Furthermore, in the prevention against rare resource shortage and the reduction of operational costs, GT65A realizes helium-free operation in a line narrowing module (LNM) and the reduction of neon consumption in a chamber [5]. A faster actuator equipped with the movable lens enables shot average of E95 bandwidth stability to be within \u00b15 fm to more rapidly adjust laser beam wavefront. More stable spectral bandwidth stability leads to improve CD uniformity. New designed LNM realizes 200 fm of lower E95 bandwidth, because it suppresses thermal wavefront deformation in optical elements and mechanical components. Lower E95 bandwidth improves image contrast and enhances exposure latitude. The combination of a faster actuator and new LNM enables tunable E95 bandwidth to vary from 200 to 450 fm at less than time intervals of a wafer lot exchange, six seconds. This enhances imaging margins by optimizing E95 bandwidth of light sources according to individual scanners. New LNM additionally enables helium-free operation to lower E95 bandwidth in spite of nitrogen purge with higher refractive index variation to temperature. The employment of a new LNM can avoid helium supply risk and saves helium consumption of 80 kL/year/unit. Gas recycling system saves by about 92% of neon consumption in ArF laser. Similarly, the recycling system saves about 85% of neon consumption in KrF laser too. These functions with GT65A improve chip yield and process margins, and support sustainable high volume manufacturing (HVM).", "ASML\u2019s 300mm scanner-systems are built on the TWINSCAN (XT/NXT) platform and yield high productivity levels for dry as well as immersion litho-scanners. NXT:1980Di immersion scanners yield productivity levels as high as 275wph while maintaining the overlay accuracy. The NXT:1980Di can be equipped with a new leveling mode that results in a significant reduction of the time that is spent on measuring the wafer focus height map. In the new leveling mode the focus height map is measured employing the full width of the level sensor and thereby minimizing the number of leveling scans. In this paper we describe the implementation of the LIL-method in the TWINSCAN platform design. Here, we report on the focus / leveling performance for both test as well as customer product wafers, and present a productivity outlook on the performance gain for a selected set of exposure use-cases.", "The Global 450mm Consortium (G450C) has completed its 5th year of developing and evaluating manufacturing 450mm tool sets. This paper focuses on how the lithography cell resolution performance has progressed from tool acceptance to current day. Initial data will be shown as well as the iterative and final data following process and equipment improvements that have been implemented over the course of the G450C program.\nThis paper will demonstrate both line/space and contact hole Critical Dimension Uniformity (CDU), one of the key indicators of resolution performance, as well as process window performance on multiple masks and resist processes. The CDU performance shows significant improvement after three main factors were implemented: custom-made photoresist, track process optimization, and Nikon Turnkey CDU Master software application. It will be demonstrated that with the implementation of optimized photoresist, Post Exposure bake (PEB) tuning and CDU Master correction that CDU results of <1nm 3\u03c3 may be achieved on 450mm wafers. The final CDU results for contact hole and line/space will be compared to 300mm production tools as well as the N7 and N10 expected requirements.\nBesides a traditional 6% Attenuated Phase Shifting Mask (APSM), G450C litho also utilizes thin Opaque MoSi On Glass Mask (OMOG). Process window comparisons will be evaluated on both mask technologies for all of the resist processes. In addition to the test masks, G450C completed the design of a three layer mask set with resist based Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) modeling and gathered \u201con product\u201d CDU performance on a Back End Of Line (BEOL) metal stack.", "In the process nodes of 10nm and below, the patterning complexity, along with multiple pattern processing and the advance materials required, has in turn resulted in a need to optimize wafer alignment mark simulation capabilities in order to achieve the required precision and accuracy for wafer alignment performance.\n\nASML\u2019s Design for Control (D4C) application for wafer alignment mark design has been extended to support the computational prediction of alignment mark performance for the latest alignment sensor on the TwinScan NXT:1980Di platform and beyond. Additional new simulation functionality will also be introduced to enable aberration sensitivity matching between the alignment mark and the device cell patterns. As a result, the design of more robust alignment marks is achieved, extending simulation capabilities for the design of wafer alignment marks and the recommendation of alignment recipe settings.", "Accurate prediction of resist profile has become more important as technology node shrinks. Non-ideal resist profiles due to low image contrast and small depth of focus affect etch resistance and post-etch result. Therefore, accurate prediction of resist profile is important in lithographic hotspot verification. Standard approaches based on a single- or multiple-2D image simulation are not accurate, and rigorous resist simulation is too time consuming to apply to full-chip. We propose a new approach of resist profile modeling through machine learning (ML) technique. A position of interest are characterized by some geometric and optical parameters extracted from surroundings near the position. The parameters are then submitted to an artificial neural network (ANN) that outputs predicted value of resist height. The new resist 3D model is implemented in commercial OPC tool and demonstrated using 10nm technology metal layer.", "As the fin based field effect transistors (Fin-FET) emerge, the device structure is changed from two dimensional to three dimensional. Due to the existence of topography, the lithographic performance may be affected and, in most cases, becomes more complicated, especially in the ion implantation process after gate being constructed. In this paper, the various parameters that may have influence on the resist topography are being investigated, such as the density, height, and corner rounding of the fin structures, the height, and the corner rounding of the gates, etc. Theoretical analysis shows that the resist image intensity among the fins and gates can be improved by increasing the thickness of the oxide on the edge of the gate. Following the above theoretical analysis, a method for lithographic performance improvement with the existence of resist topography is proposed. The method is demonstrated from the simulations with the lithography simulator PROLITH. With an optimal thickness of oxide on the surface of gate, the residual resist in the topography after development will be removed thoroughly. Compared with other methods, the proposed method requires neither a specific system setup nor an additional etch process, which is a tremendous cost-saving in mass production.", "Laser interference lithography (LIL) is a maskless lithography technique with many advantages such as simple optical design, low cost, maskless, infinite depth of focus, and large area patterning with single exposure. Compare to the tradition optical lithography, LIL is very suitable for applications which need periodic nanostructure, such as grating, light-emitting diode (LED), photonic crystals, etc. However, due to the principle of LIL, the exposure result is very sensitive to the light source and the environment vibration. Defects which perpendicular or parallel to the grating occurs when the LIL system is effect by the environment vibration. The reason that cause this defect is Moir\u00e9 fringe. When the periodic structure is fabricated in an environment with vibration source, the grating structure will have a small angle rotational vibration and the Moir\u00e9 fringe defect is formed. In order to eliminate the Moir\u00e9 fringe defect, this paper developed a new LIL system with chopper and accelerometer. The accelerometer can measure the vibration frequency. And by setting the chopper frequency equal to the vibration frequency, the Moir\u00e9 fringe defects can be eliminate. In this paper, we use a piezo stage to generate a stable vibration source with tunable frequency. In this way, we can produce a repeatable Moir\u00e9 fringe defect. By setting the chopper frequency equal to the stage vibration frequency, the Moir\u00e9 fringe defect can be eliminate. And we successfully fabricated large area periodic structure without any vibration defects. The periodic structure is 360nm pitch and the area is 2x3 cm2 .", "The optical proximity correction (OPC) systematically adds the bias with respect to the designs to the mask, correcting the proximity effects associated with sub-wavelength features. Due to the complex nature of main features of the circuits, even a carefully tuned OPC recipe can yield thousands of weak points for each tape-out. Some of these weak points require manual fixings which might demand considerable amount of effects from engineers. It has been found that for different tape-outs, the resulting OPC patterns that require manual fixings share quite a lot commonalities or are even the same. Repeatedly performing manual fixings for the same type of weak points for different tape-outs presents a waste of human efforts. We therefore constructed a pattern matching library for these types of weak points. At the very of beginning of an OPC recipe, the design patterns of these types of weak points are used to scan the whole chip and find the same patterns. Then, the pre-calculated OPC and SB (scattering bar) layers are pasted to the relevant positions. The pasted patterns will be kept fixed and serve as boundary condition for the subsequent model-based OPC. The final resulting OPC layer will be free of those types of weak points that require manual fixings.", "ArF immersion lithography is still a key candidate below 10nm node. Many challenges should be overcome when CD shrinks to such a tiny size. In the whole manufacturing flow, triple patterning (TP) is an important process. TP decomposition is used to decompose customers\u2019 layout into three individual masks. Each of the decomposed masks can be imaged in a single exposure. Although the TP decomposition method is fully studied, rare research is focused on the influence of decomposition result on other processes, such as lithography, OPC (Optical Proximity correction), etch, etc. Thus, a decomposition result that is unfriendly to other processes may appear. In this paper, we propose a lithography and OPC friendly triple patterning decomposition method. The decomposition is classified into critical decomposition and optional decompositions. The critical decomposition is applied for pitches which are smaller than the minimum pitch of single exposure. The optional decomposition is firstly applied for pitches which are in the range of forbidden pitch, and then applied for pitches in the other ranges. The critical decomposition is assigned the highest priority, and the optional decomposition for the forbidden pitch is assigned the second highest priority, the decomposition for other pitches are assigned lower priorities. The balance process is also improved correspondingly. The results show the number of forbidden pitch can be reduced by 10.8% at most. In addition, the proposed method can be easily extended to suitable for other multiple patterning processes. And the idea of assigning different priorities in the decomposition can be also used for process optimization further.", "The critical dimension(CD) is main factor to determine the line width of semiconductor equipment fabricating ability for the smallest line width of produced electronic components. Modulation transfer function(MTF) has been popularly used to evaluation the optical system, due to the contrast of each line-pair in dimension analytically, however, while the light source is coherent or near coherent for the small dimension near the optical diffraction limit, the MTF is hard to achieve consistently. The study of ultra-violet partial coherence modulation transfer function is to calculate the 1-D and 2-D the line with anoptical design program, to estimate the MTF near the size of diffraction limit. It provides fabricating parameter for a 1-to-1 TSV lithographic system. By applying partial coherence analysis, the optimized relative numerical aperture (RNA) has found. As the system is built, the optimized performance should be expected.", "Source Optimization is a key techniques to enhance the process window in ArF 193i-nm lithography process. This paper proposes a source optimization algorithm combining metaheuristic-based binary ant colony source optimization (BACO) and an artificial neural network (ANN). The purpose of this study is to establish the optimal freeform source for improving the process window of the critical patterns and maintaining the quality of aerial images. The source plane is pixelated and divided into 25 sectors. In this study, a set of the input data for training the ANN includes the pattern edge contours resulting from the various process conditions with respect to each searching agent at each iteration. The trained ANN selects sectors with effective pixel sources illuminating the target pattern to enhance the aerial image quality and improve the process window. The combination of the B-ACO and ANN methods decreases the searching space and speed up the convergence of the B-ACO. PROLITHTM (KLA-Tencor) is used to calculate the aerial image when using the optimized freeform source. The developed algorithm is tested using the 17 clips of 1D line/space pattern with various line widths, pitches and line orientations. The testing pattern includes nine horizontal line features and eight vertical line features. The minimum line width is 40 nm with a pitch of 80nm, and the maximum linewidth is 120nm with a pitch of 500nm. An optimized freeform source is simultaneously constructed for these 17 clips. The imaging performance for these 17 clips is presented.", "The multiple patterning ArF immersion lithography has been expected as the promising technology to satisfy leading edge device requirements. Gigaphoton carries out developments to improve device yields and to reduce costs of operation in exposure. One of them is ultra-narrowing spectral bandwidth of light source without Helium gas usage. The ingenious configuration of Line Narrowing Module (LNM) allows E95 bandwidth to reach 200 fm from 300 fm in Helium free operation. Narrower bandwidth will improve exposure latitude. Helium free operation will reduce operational costs and will be independent of Helium gas shortage. Second is improving stability of bandwidth. 5 fm E95 bandwidth shot average can be realized by adopting a new fast actuator and a new control method. Stable bandwidth will improve CD uniformity. They are also able to broaden a bandwidth tuning range and to make a bandwidth tuning speed faster. New type LNM and new bandwidth control that Gigaphoton has developed realize ultra-narrow bandwidth, Helium free operation, stable bandwidth, broad bandwidth tuning range and fast bandwidth tuning speed. They will contribute to the improvement of device yield in cutting edge exposure condition and the reduction of operational costs. These functions can be upgradable for our ArF excimer laser.", "ArF and KrF excimer lasers are widely used as a light source for the lithography process of semiconductor manufacturing. The excimer lasers consume laser gas mixture in a discharge chamber as laser media, and more than 96% of the gas mixture is Neon. Recently Neon supply and demand balance became critical situation; the price has risen two years ago due to the instability of politics and economy in Ukraine. Although Neon price decreased now, its price is still higher than two years ago. Gigaphoton has released gas consumption reduction, called Total Gas Management (TGM) series, as part of the green activities. Conventional gas consumption reduction (eTGM) achieved 50% gas consumption reductions from the former gas control (sTGM) by optimizing the laser gas control.\n\nIn order to reduce gas consumption further, Gigaphoton has been developing new gas recycle system hTGM. hTGM purifies used gas so that laser can use it repeatedly.

Also, internal evaluation of ArF-hTGM system has been started. The system was connected to one ArF laser and achieved 92% of the gas recycling ratio, keeping stable laser performance.", "In optical lithography tools, thermal aberration of a projection lens, which is caused by lens heating, leads to degradation of imaging quality. In addition to in-line feedforward compensation technology [1], the thermal aberration can be reduced by optimizing projection lens design. Thermal aberration analysis of a projection lens benefits the optimization of projection lens design. In this paper, thermal aberration analysis methods using physical model and simplified model are compared. Physical model of lens heating provides accurate thermal aberration analysis, but it is unable to analyze the contribution of an element of the lens to thermal aberration which is significant for thermal optimization[2]. Simplified model supports thermal analysis of an element of a lens[3]. However, only the deformation of lens surface and the variance of refractive index are considered in the simplified model. The thermal aberration analysis, in this paper, shows not only the deformation of lens surface, the variance of refractive index but also the change of optical path should be considered in thermal aberration analysis. On the basis of the analysis, a strategy for optimizing projection lens design is proposed and used to optimize thermal behavior of a lithography projection lens. The RMS value of thermal aberration is reduced by 31.8% in steady state.", "The ability to calibrate optical proximity correction (OPC) models accurately and efficiently is desired to minimize the lithography process development time. To compare layout features used for lithography process model calibration, the concept of optical similarity is introduced that is derived from the optical intensity used in OPC models. The optical similarity analysis is based on comparing contributions to the overall intensity from the different optical kernels. Optical similarity is applied in comparing individual features as well as in the analysis of pattern coverage between sets of features used in calibration of models for OPC. A method for selecting features for calibration from a larger set of features is described. A systematic approach to apply relative weights to different calibration features in order to improve model fit on complex verification data is also presented. This systematic approach to feature comparisons and pattern coverage derived from optical properties is demonstrated on numerous examples from production lithography. The methods presented here can improve the feature selection process for model calibration to ensure pattern coverage relative to full chip layout and hence improve the overall OPC model quality.", "When the negative tone development (NTD) process was introduced into photolithography, it brought fidelity improvement with it. However, the NTD process behaves in a manner that is not readily comprehended by the computational techniques used to create high-speed photolithography models for use in the Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) process. These effects are mechanical in nature and are not governed by the diffraction phenomena used to create high speed process models. This study will discuss an attempt to utilize the high speed OPC model methods to deliver an accurate representation of the NTD process. This paper will discuss a compact modeling flow for NTD processes. The flow works to emulate first principle modeling techniques for NTD in an OPC model. This is accomplished through a combination of the new mechanical methods and traditional Dill\u2019s parameters. It also reduces the data volume required to generate the OPC model. The models generated using this method accurately represent NTD SEM image contours. The results will be demonstrated and discussed.", "Model-based optical proximity correction (MB-OPC) has been widely applied in advanced lithography processes today. As k1 factor decreases and circuit design complexity increases, various advanced OPC modeling techniques have been employed to better simulate the lithography processes, such as mask3D (M3D), negative tone development (NTD) modeling techniques, etc. These advanced OPC modeling techniques introduce increasingly nonlinear behaviors in MB-OPC and bring many challenges in controlling edge placement error (EPE) and critical dimension (CD) while maintaining non-aggressive mask correction where possible for mask-rule check (MRC) compliance and better yield. In this paper, we review the MB-OPC challenges, and show our integration of Proteus inverse lithography technology (ILT) with MB-OPC as the solution to these challenges.", "Wafers at FBEOL layers traditionally have higher stress and larger alignment signal variability. ASML\u2019s ATHENA sensor based scanners, commonly used to expose FBEOL layers, have large spot size (~700um). Hence ATHENA captures the signal from larger area compared to the alignment marks which are typically ~40um wide. This results in higher noise in the alignment signal and if the surrounding areas contain periodic product structures, they interfere with the alignment signal causing either alignment rejects or in some cases- misalignment. SMASH alignment sensors with smaller spot size (~40um) and two additional probe lasers have been used to improve alignment quality and hence reduce mark/wafer rejects. However, due to the process variability, alignment issues still persist. For example, the aluminum grain size, alignment mark trench deposition uniformity, alignment mark asymmetry and variation in stack thicknesses all contribute to the alignment signal variability even within a single wafer. Here, a solution using SMASH sensor that involves designing new alignment marks to ensure conformal coating is proposed. Also new techniques and controls during coarse wafer alignment (COWA) and fine wafer alignment (FIWA) including extra controls over wafer shape parameters, longer scan lengths on alignment marks and weighted light source between Far Infra-Red laser (FIR) and Near Infra-Red (NIR) for alignment are presented. All the above mentioned techniques, when implemented, have reduced the wafer alignment reject rate from around 25% to less than 0.1%. Future work includes mark validation based on the signal response from the various laser colors. Finally, process monitoring using alignment parameters is explored.", "With continuous shrink in feature dimensions, overlay tolerance for fabrication of transistors is getting more stringent. Achieving good overlay is extremely critical in getting good yield in HVM environment. It is widely understood that good alignment during exposure is critical for better on product overlay [1]. Conventional methods to choose alignment marks on ASML scanners are based on comparing alignment key performance indicators (KPIs) including signal quality, grid repeatability, etc. It is possible that even with good alignment KPIs, OPO is still impacted. In this paper, we propose aspects that need to be monitored to choose proper alignment marks. LIS (Litho In-Sight) alignment, Ideal overlay/APC parameter signatures are used to determine and validate wafer alignment. LIS alignment \u2018Target and Profile selection\u2019 analysis enables us to determine best alignment strategy between multiple strategies/marks based on overlay measurements. Analysis includes examining wafer to wafer OPO variation which is key indicator for alignment robustness. Varying overlay parameters within lot would indicate either large process instability or alignment mark signal instability. It is possible that alignment marks depending on their segmentation can be very differently impacted with the process. Ideal overlay/APC signature stability indicates healthy process and wafer alignment. Having similar APC signatures at corresponding layers would mean that there is no major process or alignment issue.", "Considering the system performance of the projection lens, not only surface quality of the optics shall be concerned, misalignment between each optics and the wavefront distortion contributed by the mounting stress and gravity are also the factors degraded the optical performance. This article introduces the opto-mechanical design and stress-free assembly process of the reflective mirror subsystem with 300 mm in outer diameter of an I-line lithographic projection lens.\nThe flexure with mounting position pass through the center gravity of the mirror can be adopted as supporting mechanism to prevent the gravity distortion. The distortion due to temperature difference can be avoided by adopting CLERACREAM\u00ae-Z glass ceramic and INVAR for material of reflective mirror and supporting flexure respectively. The adjustment mechanism of the mirror subsystem integrates the concepts of Kinematic and exact constraint to provide six degrees of freedom (6DoF) of posture adjustment of the mirror. Furthermore, the assembly process of the flexure which minimizes the mounting stress on the mirror is presented. In the end of this article, interferometric performance test of the reflective mirror after opto-mechanical assembly compared with the measurement result in manufacturing stage is also presented. With the proposed opto-mechanical design and stress-free mounting process of the mirror, the surface distortion contributed by the amount of mounting stress and gravity effect is less than P-V 0.02 wave @632.8 nm.", "For advanced technology nodes, it\u2019s critical to address yield issues caused by process specific layout patterns with limited process window. RETs such as Model-Based Sub-Resolution Assist Feature (MB-SRAF) are introduced to guarantee high lithographic margin, but these techniques come with long runtime, especially when applied full-chip. There\u2019s also lack of integrated solution to easily identify, define comprehensive patterns and apply different controls and/or constraints over these patterns through different stages of OPC/RET process.\nIn this paper, we introduce a flow that applies advanced RET such as MBSRAF or specific local corrections to layouts with critical and yield limiting patterns. We also introduce in-process pattern match based on Cadence topological Squish pattern. Overall, this new flow of Pattern-Aware OPC (PA-OPC) achieves better margin for hotspots, without sacrificing turnaround time and is able to handle more complex patterns and environment than traditional methods. We demonstrate the benefit of the new flow with fine-grained process window control over different patterns.", "The performance requirements of advanced semiconductor technology nodes necessitate the use of complex processing methods that push patterning beyond the physical limits of DUV immersion lithography (ArFi). Specifically, aggressive process window and yield specifications put tight requirements on scanner imaging performance.\n\nAccurate identification of process windows can be accomplished using KLA-Tencor\u2019s fixed focus offset conditions and Process window Discovery (PWD) methodology[1]. The PWD methodology makes use of a modulated wafer layout to enable inspection comparing nominal to modulated conditions. KLA-Tencor\u2019s Broadband plasma (BBP) inspection technology is used to compare the nominal conditions to each experimental condition and to identify systematic defects. The identification of systematic defects is enabled by the PWD method by first discovering potential patterns of interest and then generating NanopointTM care areas around every occurrence of the patterns of interest. This allows identification of critical systematic structures that may have the same design intent but do not repeat in the same X,Y locations within a device. This approach maximizes the inspection sensitivity on each structure type, accurately identifies the edge of the process window in focus and dose, and enables study of the sensitivity of fixes process offsets (such as light source bandwidth).\n\nIn this study, a tunable DUV light source bandwidth technique and the PWD methodology are used to study the light source E95 bandwidth impact on Metal layer features from an imec 10 nm node logic-type test vehicle.", "Cymer continues to address several areas of sustainability within the semiconductor industry by reducing or eliminating consumption of power and specific types of gas (i.e. neon, helium) required by DUV light sources in order to function. Additionally, Cymer introduced a new recycling technology to reduce the dependence on production of raw gases. In this paper, those initiatives that reduce the operational cost, environmental footprint, and business continuity risk will be discussed.\n\nCymer has increased the efficiency of its light sources through improvements that have resulted in energy output increase while maintaining the same or requiring less power consumption. For both KrF and ArF systems, there have been component [1], system, and architecture improvements [2] that allowed customers to increase energy efficiency and productivity. An example of module improvements is the latest MO chamber that helped reduce power consumption by ~15%. Future improvements aim to continue reducing the power consumption and cost of operation of the install base and new systems.\n\nThe neon supply crisis in 2015 triggered an intensive effort by the lithography light source suppliers to find ways to minimize the use of neon, a main consumable of the light source used in DUV photolithography. Cymer delivered a multi-part support program to reduce natural resource usage, decrease overall cost of operation, and ensure that chipmaker\u2019s business continuity risk is minimized. The methods used to minimize the use of neon for 248 nm and 193 nm photolithography that offered significant relief from supply constraints and reduction of business continuity risk for chipmakers were described in previous work [3]. In this paper, results from the program will be presented.\n\nIn addition, techniques to capture the neon effluent and re-purify it within the semiconductor fabs have been pursued. For example, Cymer has developed and validated a neon recycling system for ArF light sources that resides within the chipmaker\u2019s fab. Cymer has partnered with a global gas supplier to develop a system capable of capturing, recycling and delivering <90% of the total neon gas required by multiple ArF light sources through automated operation, including online analysis. In this paper, the neon recycle system performance as demonstrated by a quantitative analysis of facility-supplied gas versus the recycled neon in ArF light source performance will be discussed.\n\nSimilarly, DUV light sources have historically used helium as a purge gas in the critical line narrowing module (LNM) to achieve stable wavelength and bandwidth control. Helium has a low coefficient of index of refraction change vs. temperature relative to nitrogen and provides efficient cooling and purging of critical optics in the LNM. Previous work demonstrated how helium consumption can be reduced and still achieve stable performance under all operating conditions [1]. In this paper, results of eliminating the use of helium will be described.", "Chrome migration or aging phenomenon is known for 193nm binary photomasks since a few years. 193nm irradiations and time generate an oxide growth on chrome sidewalls and then cause a non-uniform increase of critical dimensions (CD) [1], [2], [3, [4]. If not prevented or detected early enough, wafer fabs are likely to face process drifts, defectivity issues and even lower yield on wafers in the worst cases. Fortunately, some solutions have been put in place in the industry. A standard cleaning and repel service at the maskshop has been demonstrated as efficient to remove the grown materials and get the mask CD back on target. Some detection methods have been already described in literature, such as wafer CD intrafield monitoring (ACLV) [1], giving reliable results but also consuming additional SEM time with less precision than direct reticle measurement. Another approach is to monitor the CD uniformity directly on the photomask, concurrently with defect inspection for regular requalification to production for wafer fabs [5]. This enables ultimately to trigger the preventive cleanings rather than on predefined thresholds. However, may the 193nm Phase Shift Masks (PSM) be impacted too? In other words, should wafer fabs pay attention to this form of aging? Indeed, some publications [6], [7], [8] report a growth of SiO2, leading to the development of a high duration MoSi (modification of MoSi composition). This study will characterize the aging behaviour on a 193nm PSM contact hole layer, 40nm logic technology node. During this study, the aging phenomenon has been accelerated with the use of a test bench, to reach a CD increase up to 11nm after a cumulated exposure dose of 10kJ/cm2 (equivalent to exposures of >32,000 wafers 300mm). Two dice were compared, one kept as reference without any exposure, whereas the other die was aged on the accelerated test bench. Exhaustive characterization has been performed, with CD measurements on the mask and on wafers, evaluation of lithography process windows for usual patterns and most critical features (Optical Proximity Correction hotspots). It appears that despite a consistent CD increase on the mask, the impact on wafer can be neglected, at least at this amount of exposures. Aerial CD were also analysed through a Zeiss WLCDTM to enable a prediction of wafer impact. An advanced inspection tool (KLA-Tencor X5.2 model) has been challenged as an inline monitoring method to detect the aging degradation on PSM. The Intensity Critical Dimension Uniformity option (iCDUTM) was firstly developed to provide feed-forward CDU maps for scanners intrafield corrections, from arrayed dense structures on memory masks. Due to layout complexity and differing feature types, CDU monitoring on logic masks used to pose unique challenges. CDU monitoring on logic masks is now available, the latest Delta-Die and Delta-Time options gives all the needed information, as shown in this paper. In this study, iCDU has demonstrated its ability to catch a slight degradation of CD uniformity. In the end, this study shows evidences that standard cleanings used in maskshops cannot recover the mask back to its original CD. Finally, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the chemical nature of the grown material on sidewalls. TEM cuts provide a comparison between a production mask (aging over many years in production) and the test mask (accelerated aging on a test bench).", "Projection lens is an important part of the lithography. The wave aberration is the key index, which directly affects the critical dimension. The main methods of wavefront aberration detection are shear interferometry, Shack- Hartmann diffraction interferometry method and point diffraction interferometry. One shearing interference method can realize the nanometer precision. This method needs high precise motion positioning and high signal-to-noise ratio of image acquisition system. a kind of image acquisition and motor positioning control system based on shear interference was designed and realized the high precision motion position of shear grating and shearing interference fringes of synchronization acquisition. a method of improving the shearing interference image imaging quality was proposed to improve the detection precision of the wave aberration, the simulation and experiment show that wave aberration precision can reach 10 nm; At the same time, through optimizing software algorithm, greatly improve the detection time and work efficiency.", "Topological pattern-based methods for analyzing IC physical design complexity and scoring resulting patterns to identify risky patterns have emerged as powerful tools for identifying important trends and comparing different designs. In this paper, previous work is extended to include analysis of layouts designed for the 7nm technology generation. A comparison of pattern complexity trends with respect to previous generations is made. In addition to identifying topological patterns that are unique to a particular design, novel techniques are proposed for scoring those patterns based on potential yield risk factors to find patterns that pose the highest risk.", "Redundant via (RV) insertion is employed to enhance via manufacturability, and has been extensively studied. Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) process, brings a new challenge to RV insertion since newly created cut for each RV insertion has to be taken care of. Specifically, when a cut for RV, which we simply call RV-cut, is formed, cut conflict may occur with nearby line-end cuts, which results in a decrease in RV candidates. We introduce cut merging to reduce the number of cut conflicts; merged cuts are processed with stitch using litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE) multi-patterning method. In this paper, we propose a new RV insertion method with cut merging in SADP for the first time. In our experiments, a simple RV insertion yields 55.3% vias to receives RVs; our proposed method that considers cut merging increases that number to 69.6% on average of test circuits.", "With the advancement of VLSI technology nodes, light diffraction caused lithographic hotspots have become a serious problem affecting manufacture yield. Lithography hotspot detection at the post-OPC stage is imperative to check potential circuit failures when transferring designed patterns onto silicon wafers. Although conventional lithography hotspot detection methods, such as machine learning, have gained satisfactory performance, with extreme scaling of transistor feature size and more and more complicated layout patterns, conventional methodologies may suffer from performance degradation. For example, manual or ad hoc feature extraction in a machine learning framework may lose important information when predicting potential errors in ultra-large-scale integrated circuit masks. In this paper, we present a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) targeting representative feature learning in lithography hotspot detection. We carefully analyze impact and effectiveness of different CNN hyper-parameters, through which a hotspot-detection-oriented neural network model is established. Because hotspot patterns are always minorities in VLSI mask design, the training data set is highly imbalanced. In this situation, a neural network is no longer reliable, because a trained model with high classification accuracy may still suffer from high false negative results (missing hotspots), which is fatal in hotspot detection problems. To address the imbalance problem, we further apply minority upsampling and random-mirror flipping before training the network. Experimental results show that our proposed neural network model achieves highly comparable or better performance on the ICCAD 2012 contest benchmark compared to state-of-the-art hotspot detectors based on deep or representative machine leaning.", "A typical new IC design has millions of layout configurations, not seen on previous product or test chip designs. Knowing the disposition of each and every configuration, problematic or not, is the key to optimizing design for yield. In this paper, we present a method to systematically characterize the configuration coverage of any layout. Coverage can be compared between designs, and configurations for which there is a lack of coverage can also be computed. When combined with simulation, metrology, and defect data for some configurations, graph search and machine learning algorithms can be applied to optimize designs for manufacturing yield.", "Many different advanced devices and design layers currently employ double patterning technology (DPT) as a means to overcome lithographic and OPC limitations at low k1 values. Certainly device layers with k1 value below 0.25 require DPT or other pitch splitting methodologies. DPT has also been used to improve patterning of certain device layers with k1 values slightly above 0.25, due to the difficulty of achieving sufficient pattern fidelity with only a single exposure. Unfortunately, this broad adoption of DPT also came with a significant increase in patterning process cost. In this paper, we discuss the development of a single patterning technology process using an integrated Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) flow for mask synthesis. A single pattering technology flow will reduce the manufacturing cost for a k1 > 0.25 full chip random contact layer in a memory device by replacing the more expensive DPT process with ILT flow, while also maintaining good lithographic production quality and manufacturable OPC/RET production metrics.\nThis new integrated flow consists of applying ILT to the difficult core region and traditional rule-based assist features (RBAFs) with OPC to the peripheral region of a DRAM contact layer. Comparisons of wafer results between the ILT process and the non-ILT process showed the lithographic benefits of ILT and its ability to enable a robust single patterning process for this low-k1 device layer. Advanced modeling with a negative tone develop (NTD) process achieved the accuracy levels needed for ILT to control feature shapes through dose and focus. Details of these afore mentioned results will be described in the paper.", "As technology node shrinks down, hotspots, i.e. patterning failures on wafer after etching process, become an inevitable problem. The main cause of such hotspots is low contrast of aerial image. There are several methods that can improve aerial image contrast such as SRAF insertion and OPC. However, it is difficult to fix all hotspots by applying only SRAF and OPC in advanced technology node. This paper proposes a new post-layout optimization method, before SRAF and OPC, based on SOCS kernel for improving aerial image contrast and reducing hotspots. Experimental results show average 4nm PV-band improvement, as a result of contrast improvement.", "In this paper, we present a design technology co-optimization (DTCO) flow to pattern self-aligned via (SAV) using two masks with grapho-epitaxy of lamella BCP and 193i for sub-7nm design. We show that it is necessary to consider both metal and via layers at the same time in creating design rules with process variations. Due to lamella DSA\u2019s own characteristics, it can be easily applied in dense memory or SRAM applications for SAV patterning using traditional single-material metal hard mask. However, to achieve two-mask SAV solution for logic applications, we need to apply alternating hard mask in metal to cut lamella DSA patterns without compromising the technology scaling.", "In recent years, directed self-assembly (DSA) has demonstrated tremendous potential to reduce cost for multiple patterning with fewer masks, especially for via patterning. DSA is considered as one of the next generation lithography candidates or complementary lithography techniques to extend 193i lithography further for the sub- 7 nm nodes. In this work, we focus on the simultaneous DSA guiding template assignment and decomposition with DSA and double patterning (DSA-DP) hybrid lithography for 7nm technology node. We first analyze the placement error of DSA patterns with different shapes and sizes. We then propose a graph-based approach to reduce the problem size and solve the problem more efficiently without affecting the optimality of the results. The experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve a 50% reduction in both the number of variables and constraints compared to previous work, which leads to a 50X speed up in runtime.", "Directed Self Assembly (DSA) is a very promising patterning technology for the sub-7nm technology nodes, especially for via/contact layers. In the Graphoepitaxy type of DSA, a complementary lithography technique is used to print the guiding templates, where the Block Copolymer (BCP) phase-separates into regular structures. Accordingly, the design-friendliness of a DSA-based technology is affected by several factors: the complementary lithography technique, the legal guiding templates, the number of masks/exposures used to print the templates, the related design rules, the forbidden patterns (hotspots) and the characteristics of the BCP. Thus, foundries have a huge number of choices to make for a future DSA-based technology, affecting the design-friendliness and the cost of the technology. In this paper, we propose a framework for DSA technology path-finding, for via layers, to be used by the foundry as part of Design and Technology Co-optimization (DTCO). The framework optimally evaluates a DSA-based technology where an arbitrary lithography technique is used to print the guiding templates, possibly using many masks/exposures and provides a design-friendliness metric. The framework is used to evaluate technologies like DSA+193nm Immersion (193i) Lithography, DSA+Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and DSA+ Self-Aligned Double Patterning. For example, one study showed that one mask of EUV in a DSA+EUV technology can replace three masks of 193i in a DSA+193i technology.", "In the pursuit of alternatives to traditional optical lithography, block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) has emerged as a low-cost, high-throughput option. However, issues of defectivity have hampered DSA's viability for large-scale patterning. Recent studies have shown copolymer fill level to be a crucial factor in defectivity, as template overfill can result in malformed DSA structures and poor LCDU after etching. For this reason, it is previously demonstrated the use of sub-DSA resolution assist features (SDRAFs) as a method of evening out template density. In this work, we propose an algorithm to place SDRAFs in random logic contact/via layouts. By adopting this SDRAF placement scheme, we can significantly improve the density unevenness and the resources used are also optimized. This is the first work to investigate the placement of SDRAFs in order to mitigate the DSA density variation problem, and it can be adopted for the mass deployment of DSA.", "As pitch scaling is becoming constrained not only by lithographic resolution limits but alos by fundamental device and interconnect challenges the semiconductor industry has turned to cell-height reduction as a means of achieving competitive area scaling. The risk in using cell-height reduction to compensate for insufficient pitch scaling is that place- and-route inefficiencies caused by wiring congestion at the block level of the design can easily eliminate any area scaling gains made at the cell level of the design. This paper shows how careful cell-architecture optimization, physical design methodology changes, and place-and-route innovations have led to competitive block level area scaling for 7nm technology nodes and beyond. Data is presented to show that an entire node\u2019s worth of scaling can be achieved through these comprehensive design-technology co-optimization efforts.", "Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cells are used together with logic standard cells as the benchmark to develop the process flow for new logic technologies. In order to achieve successful integration of Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) as area efficient higher level embedded cache, it also needs to be included as a benchmark. The simple cell structure of STT-MRAM brings extra patterning challenges to achieve high density. The two memory types are compared in terms of minimum area and critical design rules in both the iN10 and iN7 node, with an extra focus on patterning options in iN7. Both the use of Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) mandrel and spacer engineering, as well as multi-level via\u2019s are explored. These patterning options result in large area gains for the STT-MRAM cell and moreover determine which cell variant is the smallest.", "The initial readiness of EUV patterning was demonstrated in 2016 with IBM Alliance's 7nm device technology. The focus has now shifted to driving the 'effective' k1 factor and enabling the second generation of EUV patterning. Thus, Design Technology Co-optimization (DTCO) has become a critical part of technology enablement as scaling has become more challenging and the industry pushes the limits of EUV lithography. The working partnership between the design teams and the process development teams typically involves an iterative approach to evaluate the manufacturability of proposed designs, subsequent modifications to those designs and finally a design manual for the technology. While this approach has served the industry well for many generations, the challenges at the Beyond 7nm node require a more efficient approach. In this work, we describe the use of \u201cDesign Intent\u201d lithographic layout optimization where we remove the iterative component of DTCO and replace it with an optimization that achieves both a \u201cpatterning friendly\u201d design and minimizes the well-known EUV stochastic effects. Solved together, this \u201cdesign intent\u201d approach can more quickly achieve superior lithographic results while still meeting the original device\u2019s functional specifications.\n\nSpecifically, in this work we will demonstrate \u201cdesign intent\u201d optimization for critical BEOL layers using design tolerance bands to guide the source mask co-optimization. The design tolerance bands can be either supplied as part of the original design or derived from some basic rules. Additionally, the EUV stochastic behavior is mitigated by enhancing the image log slope (ILS) for specific key features as part of the overall optimization. We will show the benefit of the \u201cdesign intent approach\u201d on both bidirectional and unidirectional 28nm min pitch standard logic layouts and compare the more typical iterative SMO approach. Thus demonstrating the benefit of allowing the design to float within the specified range. Lastly, we discuss how the evolution of this approach could lead to layout optimization based entirely on some minimal set of functional requirements and process constraints.", "We demonstrate a tool which can function as an interface between VLSI designers and process-technology engineers throughout the Design-Technology Co-optimization (DTCO) process. This tool uses a Monte Carlo algorithm on the output of lithography simulations to model the frequency of fail mechanisms on wafer. Fail mechanisms are defined according to process integration flow: by Boolean operations and measurements between original and derived shapes. Another feature of this design rule optimization methodology is the use of a Markov-Chain-based algorithm to perform a sensitivity analysis, the output of which may be used by process engineers to target key process-induced variabilities for improvement. This tool is used to analyze multiple Middle-Of-Line fail mechanisms in a 10nm inverter design and identify key process assumptions that will most strongly affect the yield of the structures. This tool and the underlying algorithm are also shown to be scalable to arbitrarily complex geometries in three dimensions. Such a characteristic which is becoming more important with the introduction of novel patterning technologies and more complex 3-D on-wafer structures.", "Conventional via patterning which relies on immersion ArF (iArF) lithography and self-aligned via (SAV) becomes challenging in sub-7nm technology. EUV lithography (EUVL) is expected to achieve smaller feature patterning thanks to its short wave length, but edge placement error (EPE) margin remains as another bottleneck of pitch scaling; SAV can be aligned with metal on the top but not with the bottom of the via. Literary study shows previous work on 2D self-aligned via (2D SAV) which can be aligned with the both metals, but it cannot extend technology scaling beyond sub-5nm whose minimum metal pitch is expected as sub-20nm due to essential limitation of EPE margin. We propose large marginal 2D SAV which has three times large EPE margin than normal 2D SAV for extremely shrunk technology node (e.g. sub-5nm). Large marginal 2D SAV may allow further feature size scaling, but it requires four EUV masks. Therefore, we present two count reduction methods and corresponding mask decompositions and pattern re-targetings. Proposed re-targeted patterns are assessed by source mask optimization (SMO) in terms of maximum EPE and process variation band (PVB) width.", "Bidirectional cell refers to a standard cell, in which metal-1 is used for both horizontal and vertical connections. Unidirectional cell, on the other hand, assumes reserved routing, e.g. metal-1 for only horizontal and metal-2 for only vertical connections. It has been introduced to take advantage of regular metal patterns, which are easier to print and can overcome the lithography limitations in sub-32nm technology. In unidirectional cell, metal-2 is laid out following the cell placement pitch. Since metal-2 pitch is usually different from placement pitch, some within-cell metal-2 become off track. This significantly degrades metal-2 routability. We propose a unidirectional cell with floating metal-2. After initial cell placement, metal-2 segment within each cell is snapped to nearest metal-2 track and is fixed. In addition, we propose cell redesign and post-placement optimization to enhance metal-1 routability. Metal-1 connections are forced to populate in limited number of tracks, so that remaining tracks are exposed during routing. Combined with post-placement optimization, this allows many longer metal-1 tracks to be available for horizontal connection. Experiments with test circuits show that routing errors are reduced by 7% and 60% with the proposed metal-1 considerations and floating metal-2 together.", "Historically, 1D metrics such as Mean to Target (MTT) and CD Uniformity (CDU) have been adequate for mask end users to evaluate and predict the mask impact on the wafer process. However, the wafer lithographer\u2019s process margin is shrinking at advanced nodes to a point that classical mask CD metrics are no longer adequate to gauge the mask contribution to wafer process error. For example, wafer CDU error at advanced nodes is impacted by mask factors such as 3-dimensional (3D) effects and mask pattern fidelity on sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) used in Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) models of ever-increasing complexity. To overcome the limitation of 1D metrics, there are numerous on-going industry efforts to better define wafer-predictive metrics through both standard mask metrology and aerial CD methods. Even with these improvements, the industry continues to struggle to define useful correlative metrics that link the mask to final device performance. In part 1 of this work, we utilized advanced mask pattern characterization techniques to extract potential hot spots on the mask and link them, theoretically, to issues with final wafer performance. In this paper, part 2, we complete the work by verifying these techniques at wafer level. The test vehicle (TV) that was used for hot spot detection on the mask in part 1 will be used to expose wafers. The results will be used to verify the mask-level predictions. Finally, wafer performance with predicted and verified mask/wafer condition will be shown as the result of advanced mask characterization. The goal is to maximize mask end user yield through mask-wafer technology harmonization. This harmonization will provide the necessary feedback to determine optimum design, mask specifications, and mask-making conditions for optimal wafer process margin.", "High-throughput electron-beam lithography (EBL) by character projection (CP) and variable-shaped beam (VSB) methods is a promising technique for low-to-medium volume device fabrication with regularly arranged layouts, such as standard-cell logics and memory arrays. However, non-VLSI applications like MEMS and MOEMS may not fully utilize the benefits of CP method due to their wide variety of layout figures including curved and oblique edges. In addition, the stepwise shapes that appear on such irregular edges by VSB exposure often result in intolerable edge roughness, which may degrade performances of the fabricated devices. In our former study, we proposed a general EBL methodology for such applications utilizing a combination of CP and VSB methods, and demonstrated its capabilities in electron beam (EB) shot reduction and edge-quality improvement by using a leading-edge EB exposure tool, ADVANTEST F7000S-VD02, and high-resolution Hydrogen Silsesquioxane resist. Both scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope observations were used to analyze quality of the resist edge profiles to determine the influence of the control parameters used in the exposure-data preparation process. In this study, we carried out detailed analysis of the captured edge profiles utilizing Fourier analysis, and successfully distinguish the systematic undulation by the exposed CP character profiles from random roughness components. Such capability of precise edge-roughness analysis is useful to our EBL methodology to maintain both the line-edge quality and the exposure throughput by optimizing the control parameters in the layout data conversion.", "In nano-meter scale Integrated Circuits, via fails due to random defects is a well-known yield detractor, and via redundancy insertion is a common method to help enhance semiconductors yield. For the case of Self Aligned Double Patterning (SADP), which might require unidirectional design layers as in the case of some advanced technology nodes, the conventional methods of inserting redundant vias don\u2019t work any longer. This is because adding redundant vias conventionally requires adding metal shapes in the non-preferred direction, which will violate the SADP design constraints in that case. Therefore, such metal layers fabricated using unidirectional SADP require an alternative method for providing the needed redundancy.\n\nThis paper proposes a post-layout Design for Manufacturability (DFM) redundancy insertion method tailored for the design requirements introduced by unidirectional metal layers. The proposed method adds redundant wires in the preferred direction - after searching for nearby vacant routing tracks - in order to provide redundant paths for electrical signals. This method opportunistically adds robustness against failures due to silicon defects without impacting area or incurring new design rule violations. Implementation details of this redundancy insertion method will be explained in this paper.\n\nOne known challenge with similar DFM layout fixing methods is the possible introduction of undesired electrical impact, causing other unintentional failures in design functionality. In this paper, a study is presented to quantify the electrical impacts of such redundancy insertion scheme and to examine if that electrical impact can be tolerated. The paper will show results to evaluate DFM insertion rates and corresponding electrical impact for a given design utilization and maximum inserted wire length. Parasitic extraction and static timing analysis results will be presented. A typical digital design implemented using GLOBALFOUNDRIES 7nm technology is used for demonstration.\n\nThe provided results can help evaluate such extensive DFM insertion method from an electrical standpoint. Furthermore, the results could provide guidance on how to implement the proposed method of adding electrical redundancy such that intolerable electrical impacts could be avoided.", "Airgap refers to a void formed in place of some inter metal dielectric (IMD). It brings about the reduction in coupling capacitance, which may contribute to improvement in circuit performance. We introduce two problems in this context. First is to choose the layers, where airgap should be applied, in such a way that total negative slack (TNS) is minimized for a given circuit. This has been motivated by the fact that best choice of airgap layers is different for different circuits. An algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, and is assessed against a naive approach in which airgap layers are simply fixed; additional 8% TNS reduction, on average of a few test circuits, is demonstrated. In the second problem, some wires of critical paths that are on non-airgap layers are reassigned to airgap layers such that TNS is further reduced; additional 3 to 14% of TNS reduction is observed.", "Line and cut based patterning for BEOL layers is an attractive solution to address the block mask patterning challenges related to self-aligned double patterning. It also enables integrated fill, with fill as an artifact of unused metal routes following lines and cuts patterning. Traditional post-layout fill involves inserting metal at large distances to limit design impact, but is less effective at alleviating metal thickness variation due to density effects. While integrated fill reduces metal thickness variation, it has a negative impact on capacitance, delay and power dissipation. This work studies the impact of pure lines/cuts integrated fill on design performance metrics using a predictive 7 nm PDK.\n\nTwo fully implemented auto-place and routed (APR) designs are considered for the experiments, one small and one large. Our comparison is from no fill to integrated fill, assuming conventional fill would not impact timing. The impact of integrated fill on capacitance and overall timing is evaluated using Calibre PEX and PrimeTime. We show these results are in line with simple \u201cback of the envelope\u201d estimates and simple models and are very significant for large designs.", "As process technology scales down, the number of Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) processes and steps used in chip manufacturing are increasing exponentially. Shrinking process margins increase the risk of excessive metal or oxide thickness or topography variations, causing potential yield problems such as dishing, erosion, resist lifting or printability issues.\nPresent DFM CMP modeling and applications mainly focus on the hotspot detection and fixing methodology for the Back-End-Of-Line (BEOL) layers [1]. Today, the present methodology is no longer sufficient to eliminate all the CMP related manufacturing defects. There is a strong demand for STI, poly and contact silicon calibrated CMP models to predict and fix the related CMP hotspots.\nShallow Trench Isolation (STI) and Poly CMP planarity is very critical in advanced technologies with Diffusion layer FIN structures and Replacement Metal Gate Process flow [2]. Gate uniformity after CMP will improve device performance, reduce CMP defects and increases the yield. Contact (Tungsten) CMP polishing is another important step that defines contact planarity, which will influence metal layer CMP planarization [3].\nThis paper will discuss design dependent CMP variations for STI, Poly and Contact CMP steps and showcase the importance of FEOL CMP modeling. We present the methodology for Silicon calibrated STI CMP, Poly and Contact CMP models and the applications of FEOL CMP models in CMP dishing and erosion hotspot analysis. We also present FEOL plus BEOL multi stack CMP simulations applications and provide design guidelines to fix CMP hotspots.", "Lithographic patterning limits can be a cost-barrier that delays advancement to new nodes. This paper introduces a cost-saving design method that enables a maskless via. Multi-patterning or coloring of a design is a technique that is used at advanced nodes to aid in patterning. Coloring allows designers to designate different patterns on one level to be printed with different masks. Stitch overlap via (SOV) is a coloring technique introduced herein. SOV utilizes via-aware coloring and a unique process flow to print a maskless via. Identification of qualifying design structures is achieved through a custom program. The program inputs the design level of the multipatterned layer and the via levels above and below to determine the coloring decomposition. Vias are a particularly challenging layer to print due to the dimensions required for these pillars. SOV is a methodology for identifying qualifying multi-patterned layouts and replacing them with a new design that enables a maskless via layer.", "Due to limited availability of DRC clean patterns during the process and RET recipe development, OPC recipes are not tested with high pattern coverage. Various kinds of pattern can help OPC engineer to detect sensitive patterns to lithographic effects. Random pattern generation is needed to secure robust OPC recipe. However, simple random patterns without considering real product layout style can\u2019t cover patterning hotspot in production levels. It is not effective to use them for OPC optimization thus it is important to generate random patterns similar to real product patterns. This paper presents a strategy for generating random patterns based on design architecture information and preventing hotspot in early process development stage through a tool called Layout Schema Generator (LSG). Using LSG, we generate standard cell based on random patterns reflecting real design cell structure \u2013 fin pitch, gate pitch and cell height. The output standard cells from LSG are applied to an analysis methodology to assess their hotspot severity by assigning a score according to their optical image parameters - NILS, MEEF, %PV band and thus potential hotspots can be defined by determining their ranking. This flow is demonstrated on Samsung 7nm technology optimizing OPC recipe and early enough in the process avoiding using problematic patterns.", "This research considers problem of sampling design space of a given physical design layout. More specifically, it deals with extraction of a set of characteristic design patterns evenly distributed within design space occupied by the layout. The methodology reported here is capable of condensing large design layouts comprised of billions of patterns to few tens of representative cases fulfilling needs of process development and process monitoring in a semiconductor manufacturing facility as well as for OPC and process compensation setup. Patterns extracted by this method include both patterns having high representation in the incoming design and anomalous configurations. In the case study we have sampled design space of a 22FDX test chip with 40 mm2 area on a contact layer. Incoming design layout comprised of 763.6 million patterns has been condensed to 61 patterns that contained all anticipated design configurations as well as a couple of unexpected findings. Extractions of compact pattern representations and multi-step hierarchical clustering method enabling full chip execution (106-1010 patterns) are discussed here in detail.", "In advanced technology nodes, lithography hotspot detection has become one of the most significant issues in design for manufacturability. Recently, machine learning based lithography hotspot detection has been widely investigated, but it has trade-off between detection accuracy and false alarm. To apply machine learning based technique to the physical verification phase, designers require minimizing undetected hotspots to avoid yield degradation. They also need a ranking of similar known patterns with a detected hotspot to prioritize layout pattern to be corrected. To achieve high detection accuracy and to prioritize detected hotspots, we propose a novel lithography hotspot detection method using Delaunay triangulation and graph kernel based machine learning. Delaunay triangulation extracts features of hotspot patterns where polygons locate irregularly and closely one another, and graph kernel expresses inner structure of graphs. Additionally, our method provides similarity between two patterns and creates a list of similar training patterns with a detected hotspot. Experiments results on ICCAD 2012 benchmarks show that our method achieves high accuracy with allowable range of false alarm. We also show the ranking of the similar known patterns with a detected hotspot.", "imec\u2019s DTCO and EUV achievement toward imec 7nm (iN7) technology node which is industry 5nm node equivalent is reported with a focus on cost and scaling. Patterning-aware design methodology supports both iArF multiple patterning and EUV under one compliant design rule. FinFET device with contacted poly pitch of 42nm and metal pitch of 32nm with 7.5-track, 6.5-track, and 6-track standard cell library are explored. Scaling boosters are used to provide additional scaling and die cost benefit while lessening pitch shrink burden, and it makes EUV insertion more affordable. EUV pattern fidelity is optimized through OPC, SMO, M3D, mask sizing and SRAF. Processed wafers were characterized and edge-placement-error (EPE) variability is validated for EUV insertion. Scale-ability and cost of ownership of EUV patterning in aligned with iN7 standard cell design, integration and patterning specification are discussed.", "Silicon testing results are regularly collected for a particular lot of wafers to study yield loss from test result diagnostics. Product engineers will analyze the diagnostic results and perform a number of physical failure analyses to detect systematic defects which cause yield loss for these sets of wafers in order to feedback the information to process engineers for process improvements. Most of time, the systematic defects that are detected are major issues or just one of the causes for the overall yield loss.\n\nThis paper will present a working flow for using design analysis techniques combined with diagnostic methods to systematically transform silicon testing information into physical layout information. A new set of the testing results are received from a new lot of wafers for the same product. We can then correlate all the diagnostic results from different periods of time to check which blocks or nets have been highlighted or stop occurring on the failure reports in order to monitor process changes which impact the yield. The design characteristic analysis flow is also implemented to find 1) the block connections on a design that have failed electrical test or 2) frequently used cells that been highlighted multiple times.", "The IC chip manufacturing process is an integrated working flow where after each manufacturing step, a yield inspection team will apply great effort and machine resources to inspect and sort through various check points to detect silicon failures. However, despite the great effort, they cannot efficiently cover a whole chip and cross check all the different layers and products at the same time.\n\nThis paper will present a smart and efficient working flow that can map inspection data back onto a design and produce more diverse monitor points for inspection, and each set of monitor points links to a set of statistical design data that shows insight on design structures that are more sensitive to the process variations. A full-chip post-processing flow is also implemented to process design layout so that the particular patterns that may cause certain function blocks to fail can be directly checked on post-processed layout.", "In this paper, standard cell design for iN7 CMOS platform technology targeting the tightest contacted poly pitch (CPP) of 42 nm and a metal pitch of 32 nm in the FinFET technology is presented. Three standard cell architectures for iN7, a 7.5-Track library, 6.5-Track library, and 6-Track library have been designed. Scaling boosters are introduced for the libraries progressively: first an extra MOL layer to enable an efficient layout of the three libraries starting with 7.5-Track library; second, fully self aligned gate contact is introduced for 6.5 and 6-Track library and third, 6-Track cell design includes a buried rail track for supply. The 6-Track cells are on average 5% and 45% smaller than the 6.5 and 7.5-Track cells, respectively.", "In this paper, we describe an integrated design space analysis approach consisting of full factorial layout generation, lithography simulations with added proximity effects, and rigorous statistical analysis through monte-carlo simulations which is used in the evaluating interconnects. This agile Design rule development process provides a quick turnaround time to down-select the potential layout configurations that can offer a competitive, robust and reliable design and manufacturing. Further layout and placement optimization is carried out to evaluate intra-cell, inter-cell and cell boundary situations, which are critical for a place and routed block. These interconnects developed using the integrated approach has been the key contributor to give 20-30% higher performance at the same Iddq leakage for 8T libraries compared to Single Diffusion break or Double Diffusion break based 12T libraries in 22FDX Technology.", "Since chip performance and power are highly dependent on the operating voltage, the robust power distribution network (PDN) is of utmost importance in designs to provide with the reliable voltage without voltage (IR)-drop. However, rapid increase of parasitic resistance and capacitance (RC) in interconnects makes IR-drop much worse with technology scaling. This paper shows various IR-drop analyses in sub 10nm designs. The major objectives are to validate standard cell architectures, where different sizes of power/ground and metal tracks are validated, and to validate PDN architecture, where types of power hook-up approaches are evaluated with IR-drop calculation. To estimate IR-drops in 10nm and below technologies, we first prepare physically routed designs given standard cell libraries, where we use open RISC RTL, synthesize the CPU, and apply placement & routing with process-design kits (PDK). Then, static and dynamic IR-drop flows are set up with commercial tools. Using the IR-drop flow, we compare standard cell architectures, and analysis impacts on performance, power, and area (PPA) with the previous technology-node designs. With this IR-drop flow, we can optimize the best PDN structure against IR-drops as well as types of standard cell library.", "As technology advances, the need for running lithographic (litho) checking for early detection of hotspots before tapeout has become essential. This process is important at all levels\u2014from designing standard cells and small blocks to large intellectual property (IP) and full chip layouts. Litho simulation provides high accuracy for detecting printability issues due to problematic geometries, but it has the disadvantage of slow performance on large designs and blocks [1]. Foundries have found a good compromise solution for running litho simulation on full chips by filtering out potential candidate hotspot patterns using pattern matching (PM), and then performing simulation on the matched locations. The challenge has always been how to easily create a PM library of candidate patterns that provides both comprehensive coverage for litho problems and fast runtime performance. This paper presents a new strategy for generating candidate real design patterns through a random generation approach using a layout schema generator (LSG) utility. The output patterns from the LSG are simulated, and then classified by a scoring mechanism that categorizes patterns according to the severity of the hotspots, probability of their presence in the design, and the likelihood of the pattern causing a hotspot. The scoring output helps to filter out the yield problematic patterns that should be removed from any standard cell design, and also to define potential problematic patterns that must be simulated within a bigger context to decide whether or not they represent an actual hotspot. This flow is demonstrated on SMIC 14nm technology, creating a candidate hotspot pattern library that can be used in full chip simulation with very high coverage and robust performance.", "In order to allow competitive and low-cost designs in the 22nm FD-SOI technology 22FDX\u2122, novel Middle-of-Line (MOL) constructs have been specifically enabled. The Gate Tie-Down (or \u201ccontinuous RX\u201d) construct allows an optimal device performance without loss of area. A method for a silicon-based evaluation and optimization of the Gate Tie-Down construct is presented here. We discuss the main design-process failure modes, their severity and the risk mitigation options. A full-factorial Design of Experiment used for the construct validation is presented and analyzed. Two critical failure modes are isolated and discussed. As a final step, the optimized design is validated over a much larger number of occurrences, showing a robust 4-sigma manufacturing design margin.", "Current patterning technology for manufacturing memory devices is being developed towards enabling high density and high resolution capability. However, as applying high resolution technology results in decreased process margin, OPC has to compensate for such effect. Since the process margin is decreased greatly for contact layers, technologies such as RBAF (Rule-Based Assist Feature), MBAF (Model-Based Assist Feature), and ILT (Inverse Lithography Technology) are considered to maximize the process margin [1, 2, 3]. Although ILT is the best solution in terms of process margin, it has several disadvantages such as long OPC run-time, mask complexity, and unstable mask fidelity. MBAF method is a good compromise for more advanced techniques mitigating those risks (but not eliminating it), which is why it is often used for contact layers.\n\nWhen setting up the rules for RBAF, not all patterns are considered. Thus, applying RBAF for contact layers may result in decreased process margin for certain patterns since the same rule is applied globally. MBAF, on the other hand, can maximize the process margin for various patterns as it generates AF (Assist Feature) to locations that maximize the margin for the patterns considered. However, MBAF method is very sensitive to even a slight change of a target, which influences the locations of the AF. This leads to generating different OPCed CD of the main features, even for those that should not be affected by the changed target. Once the OPCed CD is changed, it is impossible to obtain the same mask CD even when the mask is manufactured with the same method. If this case occurs during mass production, the entire layer needs to be confirmed after each revision which leads to unnecessary time loss.\n\nIn this paper, we suggest a new OPC method to prevent this issue. With this flow, OPCed shapes of unchanged patterns remain the same while only the changed targets are OPCed and replaced into the corresponding location, while the boundaries between those regions are corrected using a model based boundary healing. This method can reduce the overall OPCTAT as well as the time spent in verifying the entire layout after each revision. Details of these results will be described in this paper. After further studies, this flow can also be applied to ILT.", "Analog circuits are sensitives to the changes in the layout environment conditions, manufacturing processes, and variations. This paper presents analog verification flow with five types of analogfocused layout constraint checks to assist engineers in identifying any potential device mismatch and layout drawing mistakes. Compared to several solutions, our approach only requires layout design, which is sufficient to recognize all the matched devices. Our approach simplifies the data preparation and allows seamless integration into the layout environment with minimum disruption to the custom layout flow. Our user-friendly analog verification flow provides the engineer with more confident with their layouts quality.", "Beyond 40 nm technology node, the pattern weak points and hotspot types increase dramatically. The typical patterns for lithography verification suffers huge turn-around-time (TAT) to handle the design complexity. Therefore, in order to speed up process development and increase pattern variety, accurate design guideline and realistic design combinations are required. This paper presented a flow for creating a cell-based layout, a lite realistic design, to early identify problematic patterns which will negatively affect the yield.\n\nA new random layout generating method, Design Technology Co-Optimization Pattern Generator (DTCO-PG), is reported in this paper to create cell-based design. DTCO-PG also includes how to characterize the randomness and fuzziness, so that it is able to build up the machine learning scheme which model could be trained by previous results, and then it generates patterns never seen in a lite design. This methodology not only increases pattern diversity but also finds out potential hotspot preliminarily.\n\nThis paper also demonstrates an integrated flow from DTCO pattern generation to layout modification. Optical Proximity Correction, OPC and lithographic simulation is then applied to DTCO-PG design database to detect hotspots and then hotspots or weak points can be automatically fixed through the procedure or handled manually. This flow benefits the process evolution to have a faster development cycle time, more complexity pattern design, higher probability to find out potential hotspots in early stage, and a more holistic yield ramping operation.", "In advanced technology nodes, layout regularity has become a mandatory prerequisite to create robust designs less sensitive to variations in manufacturing process in order to improve yield and minimizing electrical variability. In this paper we describe a method for designing regular full custom layouts based on design and process co-optimization. The method includes various design rule checks that can be used on-the-fly during leaf-cell layout development. We extract a Layout Regularity Index (LRI) from the layouts based on the jogs, alignments and pitches used in the design for any given metal layer. Regularity Index of a layout is the direct indicator of manufacturing yield and is used to compare the relative health of different layout blocks in terms of process friendliness. The method has been deployed for 28nm and 40nm technology nodes for Memory IP and is being extended to other IPs (IO, standard-cell). We have quantified the gain of layout regularity with the deployed method on printability and electrical characteristics by process-variation (PV) band simulation analysis and have achieved up-to 5nm reduction in PV band.", "This paper proposes a novel hotspots fixing flow, in which design rule optimization and lithography RET solution are obtained simultaneously. This flow is most effective in the early development phase, and its methodology is rooted from design technology co-optimization (DTCO). Two layout files, corresponding to separate colors of a double-pattern layer (10nm node M1), are first generated by a pattern generator, and they meet no-stitching requirements and are design rule check (DRC) clean. Then, source, mask and design rule co-optimization is done with the layouts, and the design rules are optimized to remove hotspots and enable maximum lithography process window (PW). The mask optimization (MO) in combination with cost function manipulation and design rule optimization improve the robustness of initial design rule. The application of the methodology illustrates a friendly design rule and avoids later design rework.", "As the technology continues to shrink below 20nm, Double Patterning Technology (DPT) becomes one of the mandatory solutions for routing metal layers. From the view point of Place and Route (P&R), the major concerns are how to prevent DPT odd-cycles automatically without sacrificing chip area. Even though the leading-edge P&R tools have advanced algorithms to prevent DPT odd-cycles, it is very hard to prevent the localized DPT odd-cycles, especially in Engineering Change Order (ECO) routing. In the last several years, we developed In-design DPT Auto Fixing method in order to reduce localized DPT odd-cycles significantly during ECO and could achieve remarkable design Turn-Around Times (TATs). But subsequently, as the design complexity continued increasing and chip size continued decreasing, we needed a new In-design DPT Auto Fixing approach to improve the auto. fixing rate.\n\nIn this paper, we present the Stitching-Aware In-design DPT Auto Fixing method for better fixing rates and smaller chip design. The previous In-design DPT Auto Fixing method detected all DPT odd-cycles and tried to remove oddcycles by increasing the adjacent space. As the metal congestions increase in the newer technology nodes, the older Auto Fixing method has limitations to increase the adjacent space between routing metals. Consequently, the auto fixing rate of older method gets worse with the introduction of the smaller design rules. With DPT stitching enablement at In-design DRC checking procedure, the new Stitching-Aware DPT Auto Fixing method detects the most critical odd-cycles and revolve the odd-cycles automatically. The accuracy of new flow ensures better usage of space in the congested areas, and helps design more smaller chips.\n\nBy applying the Stitching-Aware DPT Auto Fixing method to sub-20nm logic devices, we can confirm that the auto fixing rate is improved by ~2X compared with auto fixing without stitching. Additionally, by developing the better heuristic algorithm and flow for DPT stitching, we can get DPT compliant layout with the acceptable design TATs.", "Foundries normally receive a large number of designs from different customers every day. It is desired to automatically profile each incoming design to quantify certain metrics like 1) the number of polygons per GDS layers 2) what kind of electrical components the design contains 3) what the dimensions of each electrical component are 4) how frequently any size of components have been used and their physical locations.\n\nThis paper will present a novel method of how to generate a complete profile of components for any particular design. The component checking flow need to be completed within hours so it will have very little impact on the tape-out time. A pre-layer checking method is also run to group commonly used layers for different electrical components and then employ different layout profiling flows. The foundry does this design chip analysis in order to find potentially weak devices due to their size or special size requirements for particular electrical components. The foundry can then take pre-emptive action to avoid yield loss or make an unnecessary mask for new incoming products before fab processing starts.", "As feature sizes and pitches continue to decrease, more complex correction algorithms are needed to solve increasingly difficult geometric configurations. Usage of these more complex algorithms results in unacceptably long time-to-mask when applied to an entire design. In many cases, the more complex algorithms are only required in a small percentage of areas of the entire design, and these areas are not always known prior to tapeout. Hotspot fixing (HSF) flows are increasingly used to fix these hotspot areas to minimize errors and decrease time-to-mask. These flows involve \u201crecorrecting\u201d a design, using the previous correction output as the input to the HSF flow. This input file contains a hierarchy that was optimized for the original correction. Hotspot areas are frequently smaller than the original correction areas and frequently repeat in unique cell outputs of the original correction, so the optimal hierarchy for a HSF fix flow may be very different from the original correction. A new hierarchy, optimized for HSF, is difficult to form from the corrected output. This paper describes the usage of pattern-matching to regain hierarchical compression for identical hotspot areas that are not repeating cells in the original correction. Using this pattern-matching HSF flow, turnaround time for the hotspot fixing can be more than 50X faster than re-using the original correction\u2019s hierarchy for complex HSF methods. These significant gains can be achieved in spite of the additional complexity it can add to the flow. In the case where simpler/faster HSF correction methods are used, significant turnaround time gains can still be made by using this pattern matching technique.\nHotspot fixing methodologies are increasingly deployed during tapeouts as a means to optimize the tradeoffs between complex, highly accurate correction methods and faster methods that are sufficient for most pattern areas.1 However, pattern database hierarchies may not be optimum for these hotspot fixing flows, as they are optimized for the initial correction run or method. This paper examines the usage of pattern matching to regain hierarchy and significantly reduce turn-around-time for complex hotspot fixing methods. Gains in turn-around-time can be well over 50 times faster than reusing the original correction\u2019s hierarchy.", "As technology advances, IC designs are getting more sophisticated, thus it becomes more critical and challenging to fix printability issues in the design flow. Running lithography checks before tapeout is now mandatory for designers, which creates a need for more advanced and easy-to-use techniques for fixing hotspots found after lithographic simulation without creating a new design rule checking (DRC) violation or generating a new hotspot. This paper presents a new methodology for fixing hotspots on layouts while using the same engine currently used to detect the hotspots. The fix is achieved by applying minimum movement of edges causing the hotspot, with consideration of DRC constraints. The fix is internally simulated by the lithographic simulation engine to verify that the hotspot is eliminated and that no new hotspot is generated by the new edge locations. Hotspot fix checking is enhanced by adding DRC checks to the litho-friendly design (LFD) rule file to guarantee that any fix options that violate DRC checks are removed from the output hint file. This extra checking eliminates the need to re-run both DRC and LFD checks to ensure the change successfully fixed the hotspot, which saves time and simplifies the designer\u2019s workflow. This methodology is demonstrated on industrial designs, where the fixing rate of single and dual layer hotspots is reported.", "Systematic yield detractors are normally expected to be identified by ATPG test result diagnostics. Different test patterns have been designed to test different functions. Test diagnostics can identify failed functions so that product engineers, based on testing results, can narrow down which block in the design performs this function. However, it is often hard to narrow down to a more specific region in a product.\n\nThis paper will present a working flow for using design diffing techniques to extract layout structures and perform a geometry analysis flow combined with testing results to find most probable suspects that may cause noticeable yield loss.", "It is very well known that as technology nodes move to smaller sizes, the number of design rules increases while design structures become more regular and the process manufacturing steps have increased as well. Normal inspection tools can only monitor hard failures on a single layer. For electrical failures that happen due to inter layers misalignments, we can only detect them through testing.\n\nThis paper will present a working flow for using pattern analysis interlayer profiling techniques to turn multiple layer physical info into group linked parameter values. Using this data analysis flow combined with an electrical model allows us to find critical regions on a layout for yield learning.", "There is an increasing demand for device level layout analysis, especially as technology advances. The analysis is to study standard cells by extracting and classifying critical dimension parameters. There are couples of parameters to extract, like channel width, length, gate to active distance, and active to adjacent active distance, etc. for 14nm technology, there are some other parameters that are cared about. On the one hand, these parameters are very important for studying standard cell structures and spice model development with the goal of improving standard cell manufacturing yield and optimizing circuit performance; on the other hand, a full chip device statistics analysis can provide useful information to diagnose the yield issue. Device analysis is essential for standard cell customization and enhancements and manufacturability failure diagnosis. Traditional parasitic parameters extraction tool like Calibre xRC is powerful but it is not sufficient for this device level layout analysis application as engineers would like to review, classify and filter out the data more easily. This paper presents a fast and efficient method based on Calibre equation-based DRC (eqDRC). Equation-based DRC extends the traditional DRC technology to provide a flexible programmable modeling engine which allows the end user to define grouped multi-dimensional feature measurements using flexible mathematical expressions. This paper demonstrates how such an engine and its programming language can be used to implement critical device parameter extraction. The device parameters are extracted and stored in a DFM database which can be processed by Calibre YieldServer. YieldServer is data processing software that lets engineers query, manipulate, modify, and create data in a DFM database. These parameters, known as properties in eqDRC language, can be annotated back to the layout for easily review. Calibre DesignRev can create a HTML formatted report of the results displayed in Calibre RVE which makes it easy to share results among groups. This method has been proven and used in SMIC PDE team and SPICE team.", "Pattern-based approaches are becoming more common and popular as the industry moves to advanced technology nodes. At the beginning of a new technology node, a library of process weak point patterns for physical and electrical verification are starting to build up and used to prevent known hotspots from re-occurring on new designs. Then the pattern set is expanded to create test keys for process development in order to verify the manufacturing capability and precheck new tape-out designs for any potential yield detractors. With the database growing, the adoption of pattern-based approaches has expanded from design flows to technology development and then needed for mass-production purposes. This paper will present the complete downstream working flows of a design pattern database(PDB). This pattern-based data analysis flow covers different applications across different functional teams from generating enhancement kits to improving design manufacturability, populating new testing design data based on previous-learning, generating analysis data to improve mass-production efficiency and manufacturing equipment in-line control to check machine status consistency across different fab sites.", "We demonstrate two different approaches of implementing design technology co-optimization (DTCO). One is on optimizing standard cells. Before being placed on mask, standard cells can be evaluated and optimized to gain better process windows. This approach enables an additional learning cycle before mask tapeout, reducing process development cost. The other approach uses a random pattern generator to create various patterns with high coverage based on given design rules. Lithography simulation is used to evaluate process window of these patterns, and annotates its printability. Test patterns generated in this way can be used for early process development.", "The abstract is not available", "Sidewall image transfer has become a key enabler of future design shrink. It is consisted of several process steps that multiply the number of lithography backbone patterns in a self-aligned form, shrinking pattern and pitch sizes.\nThe quality of the image transfer process depends on the characteristics of the sidewall pattern morphology. Rectangular Sidewalls with a flat top and vertical edges will result with symmetrical and uniform etched image. On the other hand, Facet top, bent sidewalls, sloped edges or foot, may distort the etched image and device electrical characteristics.\nIn this paper we present a description of the 3DSEM metrology technique used and simulation results. We demonstrate three dimensional characterization of Sidewalls pattern fabricated with different etch recipes:\nTop Facet measurements vs cross section images\nSpacer edge slop and oxide recess characterization", "Silicon photonics is rapidly becoming the key enabler for meeting the future data speed and volume required by the Internet of Things. A stable manufacturing process is needed to deliver cost and yield expectations to the technology marketplace. We present the key challenges and technical results from both 200mm and 300mm facilities for a silicon photonics fabrication process which includes monolithic integration with CMOS. This includes waveguide patterning, optical proximity correction for photonic devices, silicon thickness uniformity and thick material patterning for passive fiber to waveguide alignment. The device and process metrics show that the transfer of the silicon photonics process from 200mm to 300mm will provide a stable high volume manufacturing platform for silicon photonics designs.", "The LER and LWR of subtractively patterned Si and SiN waveguides was calculated after each step in the process. It was found for Si waveguides that adjusting the ratio of CF4:CHF3 during the hard mask open step produced reductions in LER of 26 and 43% from the initial lithography for isolated waveguides patterned with partial and full etches, respectively. However for final LER values of 3.0 and 2.5 nm on fully etched Si waveguides, the corresponding optical loss measurements were indistinguishable. For SiN waveguides, introduction of C4H9F to the conventional CF4/CHF3 measurement was able to reduce the mask height budget by a factor of 5, while reducing LER from the initial lithography by 26%.", "In this paper, we report on plasma assisted thermal Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) of Al2O3. The surface was modified via a fluorine containing plasma without bias power. The removal was accomplished by a thermal reaction step using tin-(II) acetylacetonate Sn(acac)2. After a few cycles, material removal stopped and growth of a Sn-containing layer was observed. Insertion of a hydrogen plasma step was found to remove the Sn layer and a continuous material removal of 0.5 \u00c5/cycle was measured. The results show that plasma assistance can be used to realize thermal ALE of Al2O3. Specifically, plasma can be used both in the fluorination step and to keep the surface free from contaminations.", "To meet scaling requirements, the semiconductor industry has extended 193nm immersion lithography beyond its minimum pitch limitation using multiple patterning schemes such as self-aligned double patterning, self-aligned quadruple patterning and litho-etch / litho etch iterations. Those techniques have been declined in numerous options in the last few years. Spacer on spacer pitch splitting integration has been proven to show multiple advantages compared to conventional pitch splitting approach. Reducing the number of pattern transfer steps associated with sacrificial layers resulted in significant decrease of cost and an overall simplification of the double pitch split technique.\nWhile demonstrating attractive aspects, SAQP spacer on spacer flow brings challenges of its own. Namely, material set selections and etch chemistry development for adequate selectivities, mandrel shape and spacer shape engineering to improve edge placement error (EPE). In this paper we follow up and extend upon our previous learning and proceed into more details on the robustness of the integration in regards to final pattern transfer and full wafer critical dimension uniformity. Furthermore, since the number of intermediate steps is reduced, one will expect improved uniformity and pitch walking control. This assertion will be verified through a thorough pitch walking analysis.", "Phase change material (PCM)-based memory cells have shown promise as an enabler for low power, high density memory. There is a current need to develop and improve patterning strategies to attain smaller device dimensions. In this work, two methods of patterning of PCM device structures was achieved using directed self-assembly (DSA) patterning: the formation of a high aspect ratio pore designed for atomic layer deposition (ALD) of etch damage-free PCM, and pillar formation by image reversal and plasma etch transfer into a PCM film. We show significant CD reduction (180 nm to 20 nm) of a lithographically defined hole by plasma etch shrink, DSA spin-coat and subsequent high selectivity pattern transfer. We then demonstrate structural fabrication of both DSA-defined SiN pores with ALD PCM and DSA-defined PCM pillars. Challenges to both pore and pillar fabrication are discussed.", "In the lithography landscape, EUV technology recovered some credibility recently. However, its large adoption remains uncertain. Meanwhile, 193nm immersion lithography, with multiple-patterning strategies, supports the industry preference for advanced-node developments. In this landscape, lithography alternatives maintain promise for continued R&D. Massively parallel electron-beam and nano-imprint lithography techniques remain highly attractive, as they can provide noteworthy cost-of-ownership benefits. Directed self-assembly lithography shows promising resolution capabilities and appears to be an option to reduce multi-patterning strategies. Even if large amount of efforts are dedicated to overcome the lithography side issues, these solutions introduce also new challenges and opportunities for the integration schemes.", "Today the IC manufacturing faces lots of problematics linked to the continuous down scaling of printed structures. Some of those issues are related to wet processing, which are often used in the IC manufacturing flow for wafer cleaning, material etching and surface preparation. In the current work we summarize the limitations for the next nodes of wet processing such as metallic contaminations, wafer charging, corrosion and pattern collapse. As a replacement, we promoted the isotropic chemical dry etching (CDE) which is supposed to fix all the above drawbacks. Etching steps of SI3N4 layers were evaluated in order to prove the interest of such technique.", "The evolution of integrated components in the semiconductors industry is nowadays looking for ultra-high selective etching processes in order to etch high aspect ratio structures in complicated stacks of ultrathin layers. For ultra-high selective processes, typical plasma etching show limitations, while wet etching processes reach limitations due to capillary forces. For these reasons there is a great regain of interest today in chemical downstream etching systems (CDE), which combine the advantages of plasma and wet treatments. The absence of photons and ions allow to minimize damages and to achieve very high selectivity (in isotropic etching). In this work we investigated the parameters enabling to etch selectively the Si3N4 to the SiO2 by CDE. We shown that the correlation between the gas mixture and the wafer temperature is the key to obtain the desired selectivity. In order to optimize the processing window, the mixture composition (NF3/N2/O2/He) and the temperatures were screened by several DOE (Designs Of Experiments). Conditions are found in which the etching selectivity between the two silicon alloys is higher than 100, which allowed us to clean out sacrificial Si3N4 layers in very high aspect ratio (about 100) silicon trenches of nanometric size (60nm) without damaging the 10nm thin SiO2 caping layer (between the Si and the Si3N4). This demonstrates that downstream plasma etching can perform better than wet treatments in this case.", "Complimentary lithography is already being used for advanced logic patterns. The tight pitches for 1D Metal layers are expected to be created using spacer based multiple patterning ArF-i exposures and the more complex cut/block patterns are made using EUV exposures. At the same time, control requirements of CDU, pattern shift and pitch-walk are approaching sub-nanometer levels to meet edge placement error (EPE) requirements. Local variability, such as Line Edge Roughness (LER), Local CDU, and Local Placement Error (LPE), are dominant factors in the total Edge Placement error budget. In the lithography process, improving the imaging contrast when printing the core pattern has been shown to improve the local variability. In the etch process, it has been shown that the fusion of atomic level etching and deposition can also improve these local variations. Co-optimization of lithography and etch processing is expected to further improve the performance over individual optimizations alone.\nTo meet the scaling requirements and keep process complexity to a minimum, EUV is increasingly seen as the platform for delivering the exposures for both the grating and the cut/block patterns beyond N7. In this work, we evaluated the overlay and pattern fidelity of an EUV block printed in a negative tone resist on an ArF-i SAQP grating. High-order Overlay modeling and corrections during the exposure can reduce overlay error after development, a significant component of the total EPE. During etch, additional degrees of freedom are available to improve the pattern placement error in single layer processes.\nProcess control of advanced pitch nanoscale-multi-patterning techniques as described above is exceedingly complicated in a high volume manufacturing environment. Incorporating potential patterning optimizations into both design and HVM controls for the lithography process is expected to bring a combined benefit over individual optimizations. In this work we will show the EPE performance improvement for a 32nm pitch SAQP + block patterned Metal 2 layer by cooptimizing the lithography and etch processes. Recommendations for further improvements and alternative processes will be given.", "Multipatterning has enabled continued scaling of chip technology at the 28nm node and beyond. Selfaligned double patterning (SADP) and self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) as well as Litho- Etch/Litho-Etch (LELE) iterations are widely used in the semiconductor industry to enable patterning at sub 193 immersion lithography resolutions for layers such as FIN, Gate and critical Metal lines. Multipatterning requires the use of multiple masks which is costly and increases process complexity as well as edge placement error variation driven mostly by overlay. To mitigate the strict overlay requirements for advanced technology nodes (7nm and below), a self-aligned blocking integration is desirable. This integration trades off the overlay requirement for an etch selectivity requirement and enables the cut mask overlay tolerance to be relaxed from half pitch to three times half pitch. Selfalignement has become the latest trend to enable scaling and self-aligned integrations are being pursued and investigated for various critical layers such as contact, via, metal patterning.\nIn this paper we propose and demonstrate a low cost flexible self-aligned blocking strategy for critical metal layer patterning for 7nm and beyond from mask assembly to low \u2013K dielectric etch. The integration is based on a 40nm pitch SADP flow with 2 cut masks compatible with either cut or block integration and employs dielectric films widely used in the back end of the line. As a consequence this approach is compatible with traditional etch, deposition and cleans tools that are optimized for dielectric etches. We will review the critical steps and selectivities required to enable this integration along with bench-marking of each integration option (cut vs. block).", "Scaling beyond the 7nm technology node demands significant control over the variability down to a few angstroms, in order to achieve reasonable yield. For example, to meet the current scaling targets it is highly desirable to achieve sub 30nm pitch line/space features at back-end of the line (BEOL) or front end of line (FEOL); uniform and precise contact/hole patterning at middle of line (MOL). One of the quintessential requirements for such precise and possibly self-aligned patterning strategies is superior etch selectivity between the target films while other masks/films are exposed. The need to achieve high etch selectivity becomes more evident for unit process development at MOL and BEOL, as a result of low density films choices (compared to FEOL film choices) due to lower temperature budget. Low etch selectivity with conventional plasma and wet chemical etch techniques, causes significant gouging (un-intended etching of etch stop layer, as shown in Fig 1), high line edge roughness (LER)/line width roughness (LWR), non-uniformity, etc. In certain circumstances this may lead to added downstream process stochastics. Furthermore, conventional plasma etches may also have the added disadvantage of plasma VUV damage and corner rounding (Fig. 1). Finally, the above mentioned factors can potentially compromise edge placement error (EPE) and/or yield.\nTherefore a process flow enabled with extremely high selective etches inherent to film properties and/or etch chemistries is a significant advantage. To improve this etch selectivity for certain etch steps during a process flow, we have to implement alternate highly selective, plasma free techniques in conjunction with conventional plasma etches (Fig 2.). In this article, we will present our plasma free, chemical gas phase etch technique using chemistries that have high selectivity towards a spectrum of films owing to the reaction mechanism ( as shown Fig 1). Gas phase etches also help eliminate plasma damage to the features during the etch process. Herein we will also demonstrate a test case on how a combination or plasma assisted and plasma free etch techniques has the potential to improve process performance of a 193nm immersion based self aligned quandruple patterning (SAQP) for BEOL compliant films (an example shown in Fig 2). In addition, we will also present on the application of gas etches for (1) profile improvement, (2) selective mandrel pull (3) critical dimension trim of mandrels, with an analysis of advantages over conventional techniques in terms of LER and EPE.", "Increasingly, advanced process nodes such as 7nm (N7) are fundamentally 3D and require stringent control of critical dimensions over high aspect ratio features. Process integration in these nodes requires a deep understanding of complex physical mechanisms to control critical dimensions from lithography through final etch. Polysilicon gate etch processes are critical steps in several device architectures for advanced nodes that rely on self-aligned patterning approaches to gate definition. These processes are required to meet several key metrics: (a) vertical etch profiles over high aspect ratios; (b) clean gate sidewalls free of etch process residue; (c) minimal erosion of liner oxide films protecting key architectural elements such as fins; and (e) residue free corners at gate interfaces with critical device elements. In this study, we explore how hybrid modeling approaches can be used to model a multi-step finFET polysilicon gate etch process. Initial parts of the patterning process through hardmask assembly are modeled using process emulation. Important aspects of gate definition are then modeled using a particle Monte Carlo (PMC) feature scale model that incorporates surface chemical reactions.1 When necessary, species and energy flux inputs to the PMC model are derived from simulations of the etch chamber. The modeled polysilicon gate etch process consists of several steps including a hard mask breakthrough step (BT), main feature etch steps (ME), and over-etch steps (OE) that control gate profiles at the gate fin interface. An additional constraint on this etch flow is that fin spacer oxides are left intact after final profile tuning steps. A natural optimization required from these processes is to maximize vertical gate profiles while minimizing erosion of fin spacer films.2", "This paper reviews some recent activity at the James Watt Nanofabrication Centre in the University of Glasgow in the area of plasma processing for energy efficient compound semiconductor-based transistors. Atomic layer etching suitable for controllable recess etching in GaN power transistors will be discussed. In addition, plasma based surface passivation techniques will be reviewed for a variety of compound semiconductor materials ((100) and (110) oriented InGaAs and InGaSb).", "The infrared absorption of SF6 gas is of narrowband and peaks at 10.6\u03bcm. This narrow band absorption posts a stringent requirement on the corresponding sensors as they need to collect enough signal from this limited spectral range to maintain a high sensitivity. Resonator-Quantum Well Infrared Photo detectors (R-QWIPs) are the next generation of QWIP detectors that use resonances to increase the quantum efficiency (QE) for more efficient signal collection. Since the resonant approach is applicable to narrowband as well as broadband, it is particularly suitable for this application. We designed and fabricated R-QWIPs for SF6 gas detection. To achieve the expected performance, the detector geometry must be produced according to precise specifications. In particular, the height of the diffractive elements (DE) and the thickness of the active resonator must be uniform, and accurately realized to within 0.05 \u03bcm. additionally, the substrates of the detectors must be removed totally to prevent the escape of unabsorbed light in the detectors. To achieve these specifications, two optimized inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching processes are developed. Due to submicron detector feature sizes and overlay tolerance, we use an ASML stepper instead of a contact mask aligner to pattern wafers. Using these etching techniques and tool, we have fabricated FPAs with 30 \u03bcm pixel pitch and 320x256 format. The initial test results showed promising results.", "There is a growing interest in new spin on metal oxide hard mask materials for advanced patterning solutions both in BEOL and FEOL processing. Understanding how these materials respond to plasma conditions may create a competitive advantage. In this study patterning development was done for two challenging FEOL applications where the traditional Si based films were replaced by EMD spin on metal oxides, which acted as highly selective hard masks. The biggest advantage of metal oxide hard masks for advanced patterning lays in the process window improvement at lower or similar cost compared to other existing solutions.", "Block copolymers (BCPs) are consisted of at least two types of monomers which have covalent bonding. One of the widely investigated BCPs is polystyrene-block-polydimethylsiloxane (PS-b-PDMS), which is used as an alternative patterning method for various deep nanoscale devices due to its high Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (\u03c7), such as optical devices and transistors, replacing conventional photolithography. As an alternate or supplementary nextgeneration lithography technology to extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), BCP lithography utilizing the DSA of BCP has been actively studied. However, the nanoscale BCP mask material is easily damaged by the plasma and has a very low etch selectivity over bottom semiconductor materials, because it is composed of polymeric materials even though it contains Si in PDMS. In this study, an amorphous carbon layer (ACL) was inserted as a hardmask material between BCP and materials to be patterned, and, by using O2 plasmas, the characteristics of dry etching of ACL for high aspect ratio (HAR) using a 10 nm PDMS pattern were investigated. The results showed that, by using a PS-b-PDMS pattern with an aspect ratio of 0.3~0.9:1, a HAR PDMS/ACL double layer mask with an aspect ratio of ~10:1 could be fabricated. In addition, by the optimization of the plasma etch process, ACL masks with excellent sidewall roughness (SWR,1.35 nm) and sidewall angle (SWA, 87.9\u02da) could be fabricated.", "Dimension shrinkage has been a major driving force in the development of integrated circuit processing over a number of decades. The Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) technique is widely adapted for sub-10nm node in order to achieve the desired feature dimensions. This technique provides theoretical feasibility of multiple pitch-halving from 193nm immersion lithography by using various pattern transferring steps. The major concept of this approach is to a create spacer defined self-aligned pattern by using single lithography print. By repeating the process steps, double, quadruple, or octuple are possible to be achieved theoretically. In these small architectures, line roughness control becomes extremely important since it may contribute to a significant portion of process and device performance variations. In addition, the complexity of SAQP in terms of processing flow makes the roughness improvement indirective and ineffective. It is necessary to discover a new approach in order to improve the roughness in the current SAQP technique.\nIn this presentation, we demonstrate a novel method to improve line roughness performances on 30nm pitch SAQP flow. We discover that the line roughness performance is strongly related to stress management. By selecting different stress level of film to be deposited onto the substrate, we can manipulate the roughness performance in line and space patterns. In addition, the impact of curvature change by applied film stress to SAQP line roughness performance is also studied. No significant correlation is found between wafer curvature and line roughness performance. We will discuss in details the step-by-step physical performances for each processing step in terms of critical dimension (CD)/ critical dimension uniformity (CDU)/line width roughness (LWR)/line edge roughness (LER). Finally, we summarize the process needed to reach the full wafer performance targets of LWR/LER in 1.07nm/1.13nm on 30nm pitch line and space pattern.", "Next generation semiconductor technologies like high density memory storage require precise 2D and 3D nanopatterns. Plasma etching processes are essential to achieving the nanoscale precision required for these structures. Current plasma process development methods rely primarily on iterative trial and error or factorial design of experiment (DOE) to define the plasma process space. Here we evaluate the efficacy of the software tool Recipe Optimization for Deposition and Etching (RODEo) against standard industry methods at determining the process parameters of a high density O2 plasma system with three case studies. In the first case study, we demonstrate that RODEo is able to predict etch rates more accurately than a regression model based on a full factorial design while using 40% fewer experiments. In the second case study, we demonstrate that RODEo performs significantly better than a full factorial DOE at identifying optimal process conditions to maximize anisotropy. In the third case study we experimentally show how RODEo maximizes etch rates while using half the experiments of a full factorial DOE method. With enhanced process predictions and more accurate maps of the process space, RODEo reduces the number of experiments required to develop and optimize plasma processes.", "As CMOS technology reaches 14nm node and beyond, one of the key challenges of the extension of 193nm immersion lithography is how to control the line edge and width roughness (LER/LWR). For Self-aligned Multiple Patterning (SaMP), LER becomes larger while LWR becomes smaller as the process proceeds[1]. It means plasma etch process becomes more and more dominant for LER reduction. In this work, we mainly focus on the core etch solution including an extra plasma coating process introduced before the bottom anti reflective coating (BARC) open step, and an extra plasma cure process applied right after BARC-open step. Firstly, we leveraged the optimal design experiment (ODE) to investigate the impact of plasma coating step on LER and identified the optimal condition. ODE is an appropriate method for the screening experiments of non-linear parameters in dynamic process models, especially for high-cost-intensive industry [2]. Finally, we obtained the proper plasma coating treatment condition that has been proven to achieve 32% LER improvement compared with standard process. Furthermore, the plasma cure scheme has been also optimized with ODE method to cover the LWR degradation induced by plasma coating treatment.", "Following Moore\u2019s law, integrated circuit requires scaling gate length to 14nm and beyond. To enable such gate-length scaling, finFETs have widely replaced planar metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) due to its special 3D structure could provide larger effective channel width and better short channel controllability. However, Fin critical dimension (CD) and profile variation between dense and ISO fin in a conventional etch process can introduce additional device degradation. Therefore, rigorous process loading control in reactive ion etch (RIE) becomes more critical. This paper mainly focused on self-aligned double patterning mandrel etch and fin etch by using advanced pulsed plasma to deliver a well-loading fin.", "In this work, we present an attractive and novel fabrication technique that can produce highly-controlled silicon-based nanostructures in wafer-scale by a seldom used material in IC fabrication, amorphous silicon (\u03b1-Si), as an etch mask. The \u03b1-Si mask pattern is precisely transferred into the underlying SiO2 substrate material with a high fidelity by a novel top-down fabrication. It is the first time for \u03b1-Si film used as an etch mask to fabricate various Si-based nanostructures. It is observed that the \u03b1-Si mask can significantly reduce the pattern edge roughness and achieve highly uniform and smooth sidewalls. SiO2 nanostructures directly fabricated can be served as nanotemplates to transfer into the underlying substrates such as silicon, germanium, transistor gate or other dielectric materials to form electrically functional nanostructures and devices. Several typical Si-based nanostructures, such as nanoline, nanofin and transistor gate patterning, have been fabricated successfully using the simple \u03b1-Si material combining with electron beam lithography. Our results demonstrate that the Si-based nanostructures as small as sub-20 nm may be achievable. More significantly, the novel approach is a potentially universal method that is fully compatible with the current existing Si-based CMOS technologies.", "With the rapid development of semiconductors, today's optical lithography is approaching its physical limits, and thus alternative patterning technology is urgently desired. Extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, using a wavelength of 13.5 nm, is considered one of the most prominent candidates for next generation lithography. The main challenge for EUV resists is to simultaneously satisfy resolution, LWR (line-width roughness) and sensitivity requirements following the ITRS roadmap. Though polymer-based CAR (chemically amplified resist) is the current standard photoresist, entirely new resist platforms are required due to the performance targets of smaller process nodes. In this paper, our recent progress in metal oxide nanoparticle photoresist research will be discussed. Brief discussion of a number of important structure and property issues pertaining to key characteristics affecting resist performance is also included.", "EUV lithography utilizes photons with 91.6 eV energy to ionize resists, generate secondary electrons, and enable electron driven reactions that produce acid in chemically amplified photoresist. Efficiently using the available photons is of key importance. Unlike DUV lithography, where photons are selectively utilized by photoactive compounds, photons at 13.5nm wavelength ionize almost all materials. Nevertheless, specific elements have a significantly higher atomic photon-absorption cross section at 91.6 eV. To increase photon absorption, sensitizer molecules, containing highly absorbing elements, can be added to photoresist formulations. These sensitizers have gained growing attention in recent years, showing significant sensitivity improvement. But there are few experimental evidences that the sensitivity improvement is due to the higher absorption only, as adding metals salts into the resist formulation can induce other mechanisms, like modification of the dissolution rate, potentially affecting patterning performance. In this work, we used different sensitizers in chemically amplified resist. We measured experimentally the absorption of EUV light, the acid yield, the dissolution rate and the patterning performance of the resists. Surprisingly, the absorption of EUV resist was decreased with addition of metal salt sensitizers. Nevertheless, the resist with sensitizer showed a higher acid yield. Sensitizer helps achieving higher PAG conversion to acid, notably due to an increase of the secondary electron generation. Patterning data confirm a significant sensitivity improvement, but at the cost of roughness degradation at high sensitizer loading. This can be explained by the chemical distribution of the sensitizer in the resist combined with a modification of the dissolution contrast, as observed by Dissolution Rate Monitor.", "Irresistible Materials (IM) is developing novel resist systems based on the multi-trigger concept, which incorporates a dose dependent quenching-like behaviour. The Multi Trigger Resist (MTR) is a negative tone crosslinking resist that does not need a post exposure bake (PEB), and during the past years, has been mainly tested using interference lithography at PSI. In this study, we present the results that have been obtained using MTR resists, performing EUV exposures on ASML NXE3300B EUV scanner at IMEC.\nWe present the lithography performance of the MTR1 resist series in two formulations \u2013 a high-speed baseline, and a formulation designed to enhance the multi-trigger behaviour. Additionally, we present results for the MTR2 resist series, which has been designed for lower line edge roughness. The high-speed baseline resist (MTR1), showed 18 nm resolution at 20mJ/cm2. The MTR2 resist shows 16nm half pitch lines patterned with a dose of 38mJ/cm2, giving a LER of 3.7 nm. Performance across multiple process conditions are discussed. We performed etch rate measurement and the multi-trigger resist showed etch resistance equivalent or better than standard chemically amplified resist. This could compensate for the lower film thickness required to avoid pattern collapse at pitch 32nm.", "The chemical structure and thermal reactivity of recently discovered inorganic-organic hybrid resist materials are characterized using a combination of in situ and ex situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). The materials are comprised of a small HfOx core capped with methacrylic acid ligands that form a combined hybrid cluster, HfMAA. The observed IR modes are consistent with the calculated modes predicted from the previously determined x-ray crystal structure of the HfMAA-12 cluster, but also contain extrinsic hydroxyl groups. We find that the water content of the films is dependent on the concentration of excess ligand added to the solution. The effect of environment used during post-application baking (PAB) is studied and correlated to changes in solubility of the films. In doing so, we find that hydroxylation of the clusters results in formation of additional Hf-O-Hf linkages upon heating, which in turn impacts the solubility of the films.", "Metal oxoclusters are hybrid inorganic-organic molecular compounds with a well-defined number of metal and oxygen atoms in their cores. This type of materials is a promising platform for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresists: their inorganic cores provide them with tunable EUV absorptivity and their molecular nature might favour smaller resolution and roughness while it also renders specific spectroscopic fingerprints that allow to monitor the chemical changes induced by EUV light. In this work, we compare the EUV photochemistry of metal oxoclusters based on Ti, Zr, and Hf and methacrylate ligands (Mc) and their sensitivity as resist materials for EUV lithography. Decarboxylation processes upon EUV exposure are detected in all cases with ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). However, the structural changes after film deposition and after exposure differed among the three compounds. Higher sensitivity was detected for the Hf-based material than for the Zr-based analogue, in line with its higher absorptivity. XPS analyses suggest that only a small fraction of the carboxylate ligands is lost at the dose-to-gel. This change in the chemical composition is accompanied by an increased structural disorder in the layer and a rather small degree of aggregation, according to grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS). These results indicate that neither a drastic loss of organic shell nor a high degree of aggregation of the naked inorganic cores are required for this type of molecular thin film to reliably operate as a resist material.", "The metal containing resist is one of the strong candidates for high lithographic performance Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) resists. EIDEC has prepared the infrastructure for outgas testing in hydrogen environment for metal containing resists at High Power EUV irradiation tool (HPEUV). We have experimentally obtained the preliminary results of the non-cleanable metal contamination on witness sample using model material by HPEUV [1]. The metal contamination was observed at only the condition of hydrogen environment. It suggested the generation of volatile metal hydrides by hydrogen radicals. Additionally, the metal contamination on a witness sample covered with Ru was not removed by hydrogen radical cleaning. The strong interaction between the metal hydride and Ru was confirmed by the absorption simulation [2]. Recently, ASML announced a resist outgassing barrier technology using Dynamic Gas Lock (DGL) membrane located between projection optics and wafer stage [3, 4]. DGL membrane blocks the diffusion of all kinds of resist outgassing to the projection optics and prevents the reflectivity loss of EUV mirrors. The investigation of DGL membrane for high volume manufacturing is just going on. It extends the limitation of material design for EUV resists. However, the DGL membrane has an impact for the productivity of EUV scanners due to the transmission loss of EUV light and the necessity of periodic maintenance. The well understanding and control of the outgassing characteristics of metal containing resists may help to improve the productivity of EUV scanner. We consider the outgas evaluation for the resists still useful. For the improvement of resist outgas testing in hydrogen, there are some issues such as the contamination limited regime, the optimization of exposure dose to obtain the measurable contamination film thickness and the detection of minimum amount of metal related outgas species generated. We are considering a new platform of outgas testing for metal containing resists based on the electron-beam irradiation system as one of the solutions for these issues. The concept is presented in this paper.", "The relationship between edge placement error, semiconductor design-rule determination and predicted yield in the era of EUV lithography is examined. This paper starts with the basics of edge placement error and then builds up to design-rule calculations. We show that edge placement error (EPE) definitions can be used as the building blocks for design-rule equations but that in the last several years the term \u201cEPE\u201d has been used in the literature to refer to many patterning errors that are not EPE. We then explore the concept of \u201cGood Fields\u201d1 and use it predict the n-sigma value needed for design-rule determination. Specifically, fundamental yield calculations based on the failure opportunities per chip are used to determine at what n-sigma \u201cvalue\u201d design-rules need to be tested to ensure high yield. The \u201cvalue\u201d can be a space between two features, an intersect area between two features, a minimum area of a feature, etc. It is shown that across chip variation of design-rule important values needs to be tested at sigma values between seven and eight which is much higher than the four-sigma values traditionally used for design-rule determination. After recommending new statistics be used for design-rule calculations the paper examines the impact of EUV lithography on sources of variation important for design-rule calculations. We show that stochastics can be treated as an effective dose variation that is fully sampled across every chip. Combining the increased within chip variation from EUV with the understanding that across chip variation of design-rule important values needs to not cause a yield loss at significantly higher sigma values than have traditionally been looked at, the conclusion is reached that across-wafer, wafer-to-wafer and lot-to-lot variation will have to overscale for any technology introducing EUV lithography where stochastic noise is a significant fraction of the effective dose variation. We will emphasize stochastic effects on edge placement error distributions and appropriate design-rule setting. While CD distributions with long tails coming from stochastic effects do bring increased risk of failure (especially on chips that may have over a billion failure opportunities per layer) there are other sources of variation that have sharp cutoffs, i.e. have no tails. We will review these sources and show how distributions with different skew and kurtosis values combine.", "Although lens aberrations in EUV imaging systems are very small, aberration impacts on pattern placement error and overlay error need to be carefully investigated to obtain the most robust lithography process for high volume manufacturing. Instead of focusing entirely on pattern placement errors in the context of a single lithographic process, we holistically study the interaction between two sequential lithographic layers affected by evolving aberration wavefronts, calculate aberration induced overlay error, and explore new strategies to improve overlay.", "The key challenge for enablement of a 2nd node of single-expose EUV patterning is understanding and mitigating the patterning-related defects that narrow the process window. Typical in-line inspection techniques, such as broadband plasma (291x) and e-beam systems, find it difficult to detect the main yield-detracting defects post-develop, and thus understanding the effects of process improvement strategies has become more challenging. New techniques and methodologies for detection of EUV lithography defects, along with judicious process partitioning, are required to develop process solutions that improve yield.\nThis paper will first discuss alternative techniques and methodologies for detection of lithography-related defects, such as scumming and microbridging. These strategies will then be used to gain a better understanding of the effects of material property changes, process partitioning, and hardware improvements, ultimately correlating them directly with electrical yield detractors .", "The EUV source is an impressive feat of engineering that provides 13.5 nm radiation by vaporizing tin droplets with a high power CO2 laser and focusing the photons produced in the resultant plasma into the scanner illumination system. Great strides have been made in addressing the many potential stability challenges, but there are still residual spatial and temporal dose non-uniformity signatures. Since even small dose errors can impact the yieldable process window for the advanced lithography products that are exposed on EUV scanners it is crucial to monitor and control the dose variability.\nUsing on-board metrology, the EUV scanner outputs valuable metrics that provide real time insight into the dose performance. We have supplemented scanner data collection with a wafer based methodology that provides high throughput, high sensitivity, quantitative characterization of the EUV scanner dose delivery. The technique uses open frame EUV exposures, so it is exclusive of lithographic pattern imaging, exclusive of lithographic mask pattern and not limited by placement of metrology features. Processed wafers are inspected rapidly, providing 20,000 pixels of detail per exposure field in approximately one minute. Exposing the wafer on the scanner with a bit less than the resist E0 (open frame clearing dose) results in good sensitivity to small variations in the EUV dose delivered. The nominal exposure dose can be modulated by field to calibrate the inspection results and provide quantitative assessment of variations with < 1% sensitivity. This technique has been used for dose uniformity assessments. It is also being used for long term dose stability monitoring and has proven valuable for short term dose stability follow up investigations.", "In the last year, the continuous efforts on the development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has allowed to push the lithographic performance of the EUV photoresists on the ASML NXE:3300 full field exposure tool. Today imec N7 node (equivalent to foundry N5) is the first scaling node at which industry will likely insert EUV into production which will bring a reduction in processing steps therefore reducing total cost of ownership [1], increasing yield and reducing time to ramp. However, the high-volume-manufacturing (HVM) requirement to have a cost-effective low exposure dose photoresist (<20mJ/cm2) remains a big challenge and roughness and pattern defectivity at nano-scale are the major limiting factors of the lithographic process window of EUV resist when looking at tight pitches below 40nm [2, 3].\nTo be effective during the lithographic EUV material screening phase for such tight pitches, it is necessary to implement complementary metrology analyses that can provide precise information on the resist roughness and a quick feedback on the quantification of nano-failures (nano-bridges, broken lines, merging or missing contacts) induced by a stochastic EUV patterning regime, the random nature of the light-matter interaction and consequent chemical reactions. Beside the traditional approach to characterize a resist with metrics as exposure latitude (EL%), depth of focus (DoF) and line-edge-roughness (LER) based on CDSEM measurements, we have used the power spectra density (PSD) [4] to get an unbiased value of the resist line roughness (LWR and LER) by using Fractilia metroLERTM commercial software. Further, we have used Stochalis imec software [5] to quantify patterning nano failures providing an early stage assessment on the patterning fidelity of the examined resists.\nWe present the resist characterization results for 32nm dense line-space pattern on different substrates and for 36nm dense and orthogonal contact hole pitch pattern for different photoresists. Two positive tone chemically amplified (CA) resists have been identified at the exposure dose of 45mJ/cm2 and 33mJ/cm2 for logic (pitch 32nm dense line/space) and memory (pitch 36nm dense contact holes) use cases, respectively.", "With the introduction of its fifth-generation NXE:3400B scanner, ASML brought EUV to High- Volume Manufacturing for 7 nm node lithography and beyond with full support of pellicle. This paper presents an update on lithographic performance results obtained with the NXE:3400B, characterized by an NA of 0.33, a Pupil Fill Ratio (PFR) of 0.2 and throughput capability of 125 wafers per hour. Advances in source power and system availability have enabled a continued increase of productivity. To maximize the number of yielding dies per day excellent Overlay, Focus, and Critical Dimension (CD) control have been realized, combining intrinsic tool stability with holistic control schemes. We will also show matching performance for both Overlay and Imaging, and further improvements in Focus Process Dependencies for the 5nm node.", "Vote-taking lithography is a method for mitigating mask defects, which has been applied in the 1980\u2019s to enhance yield. Vote-taking sums up N different mask images with identical content, each at 1/N dose, to mitigate the defects on each individual mask. The fundamental assumption is that the mask defects do not correlate in position from mask to mask, and so each individual defect will be blended with good images from the other N-1 masks. Vote-taking has recently been brought under the attention again for consideration in EUV lithography, where it might provide a temporary solution for situations in which the defectivity conditions are not yet meeting expectations.\nThis paper provides a thorough experimental assessment of the implementation of vote-taking, and discusses its pro\u2019s and con\u2019s. Based on N=4 vote-taking, we demonstrate the capability to mitigate different types of mask defects. Additionally, we found that blending different mask images brings clear benefit to the imaging, and provide experimental confirmation of improved local CDU and intra-field CDU, reduction of stochastic failures, improved overlay, ... Finally, we perform dedicated throughput calculations based on the qualification performance of ASML\u2019s NXE:3400B scanner.\nThis work must be seen in the light of an open-minded search for options to optimally enable and implement EUV lithography. While defect-free masks and EUV pellicles are without argument essential for most of the applications, we investigate whether some applications could benefit from vote-taking.", "As more aggressive EUV imaging techniques and resists with lower intrinsic roughness are developed for patterning at 7nm and 5nm technology nodes, EUV mask roughness will contribute an increasing portion of the total printed linewidth roughness (LWR). In this study, we perform a comprehensive characterization of the EUV mask impacts on wafer LWR using actinic aerial images and wafer SEM images. Analytical methods are developed to properly separate and compare the LWR effects from EUV masks, photon shot noise, and resist stochastics. The use of EUV AIMSTM to emulate and measure incident photon shot noise effects is explored and demonstrated. A sub-10nm EUV mask is qualified using EUV AIMSTM with scanner equivalent dose settings that are required for patterning 16nm and 18nm half-pitch L/S features with low- and high-dose CAR resists. The variance and spectral components contributing to wafer LWR are quantified and compared.", "Stochastics effects are the ultimate limiter of optical lithography technology and are a major concern for next-generation technology nodes in EUV lithography. Following up on work published last year, we compare the performance of organic chemically-amplified and condensed metal-oxide resists exposed at different sizing doses using a proxy 2D SRAM layout. For each combination of material, technology node, and lithographic approach, we perform 550,000 physics based Monte-Carlo simulations of the SRAM cell. We look at many performance data, including stochastic process variation bands at fixed, nominal conditions assuming no variation in process parameters vs. the stochastic process variation bands obtained by inclusion of process parameters. Perturbations are applied to exposure dose, focus, chief-ray azimuthal angle, mask CD, stack thicknesses, and PEB temperature.\nWe study stochastic responses for three technology nodes:\n\u2022 An SRAM cell for 7 nm technology node, with Numerical Aperture = 0.33 and patterned with organic chemically amplified resist\n\u2022 An SRAM cell for 5 nm technology node, with Numerical Aperture = 0.33 and patterned with:\no Organic chemically amplified resist\no Fast photospeed organic chemically amplified resist\no Metal-oxide resist\n\u2022 An SRAM cell for 3 nm technology node, patterned with organic chemically amplified resist and:\no Numerical Aperture = 0.33 in single exposure\no Numerical Aperture = 0.33 with double exposure\no Numerical Aperture = 0.55 with anamorphic pupil\nFor each case, we optimize mask bias, source illumination and process conditions across focus to maximize the optical contrast. We did not apply optical proximity correction to the mask. The purpose of the work is to evaluate the stochastic behavior of different features as a function of material strategy, technology node, and lithographic approach.", "This paper summarizes findings for an N5 equivalent M2 (pitch 32) layer patterned by means of SE EUV. Different mask tonalities and resist tonalities have been explored and a full patterning (litho plus etch) process into a BEOL stack has been developed. Resolution enhancement techniques like SRAFs insertion and retargeting have been evaluated and compared to a baseline clip just after OPC. Steps forward have been done to develop a full patterning process using SE EUV, being stochastics and variability the main items to address.", "We developed the novel process and material which can be created reverse-tone pattern without any collapse. The process was Dry Development Rinse (DDR) process, and the material used in this process was DDR material. DDR material was containing siloxane polymer which could be replaced the space area of the photo resist pattern. And finally, the reverse-tone pattern could be obtained by dry etching process without any pattern collapse issue.\nDDR process could be achieved fine line and space patterning below hp14nm without any pattern collapse by combination of PTD or NTD photo resist.\nDDR materials were demonstrated with latest coater track at imec. DDR process was fully automated and good CD uniformity was achieved after dry development. Detailed evaluation could be achieved with whole wafer such a study of CD uniformity (CDU). CDU of DDR pattern was compared to pre-pattern\u2019s CDU. Lower CDU was achieved and CDU healing was observed with special DDR material. By further evaluation, special DDR material showed relatively small E-slope compared to another DDR material. This small E-slope caused CDU improvement.", "The next generation beyond 7nm node potentially requires the implementation of Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAF) with EUV lithography. This paper aims at providing a clear SRAF strategy for the next generation beyond 7nm node designs through a series of experiments. Various factors are considered, including: stochastic effects, 3D mask effects, through-slit effects, aberrations, and pixelated SMO sources.\nEUV has 13.5nm as its wavelength, which is much smaller than the wavelength used in ArF lithography, and this gives very different imaging challenges compared to the ArF case. Due to the small wavelength and numerical aperture (NA) of the current EUV tools, depth of focus is not as significant of a concern as in DUV. Instead, EUV lithography is severely challenged by stochastic effects, which are directly linked to the slope of the intensity curve. DUV SRAF has been shown to be a powerful tool for improving NILS/ILS, as well as DOF, and here we explore how that translates into EUV imaging. In this paper, we consider Process Variability (PV) Bands with a variety of process conditions including focus/dose/mask bias changes and also the NILS/ILS as our objective functions, to determine what the best SRAF solution is for a set of test patterns. We have full investigations on both symmetric SRAF and asymmetric SRAF.\nSRAF can potentially mitigate image shift through focus, i.e. non-telecentricity, caused by EUV 3D shadowing effect. This shadowing effect is pattern dependent and contributes to the overlay variation. As we approach the next generation beyond 7nm node, this image shift can be more significant relative to the overlay budget, hence we further investigate the impact of SRAF placement to the image shift. Moreover, the Center of Focus shift due to the large 3D mask absorber thickness can be potentially mitigated by SRAF implementation. The common process window is significantly impacted by both the center of focus shift and the individual depth of focus. We study the change by adding SRAF using both a symmetric source (standard source) and an asymmetric source (SMO source). Once SRAF is inserted for the test patterns, the common process window is plotted to compare the solutions with and without SRAF.\nFinally, we understand the importance of using full flare map and full through slit model (including aberration variation through slit) in the main feature correction, but in this paper, we will further evaluate the need of using full models in SRAF insertion. This is a necessary step to determine the strategy of SRAF implementation for the next generation beyond 7nm node.", "As minimum feature size shrinks to a metal pitch of 21 nm, the current extreme ultra violet (EUV) lithographic tool with a numeric aperture (NA) of 0.33 will face resolution limit for some critical layers. High NA (0.55) EUV with anamorphic optics or EUV double patterning (DP) at 0.33 NA are being considered for the next generation of lithographic technology. Both the high NA EUV system and EUV DP will enhance resolution relative to current EUV single patterning (SP). Nevertheless, in order to be able to compare EUV DP and High NA EUV processes, important lithographic factors including image contrast, mask three dimension (M3D) effects, process variation band, stochastic effects and local critical dimension uniformity need to be investigated to understand their contributions to process variations. This study was carried out using rigorous lithographic model simulations in Sentaurus Lithography, where strong M3D effects in EUVL are computed physically. We have simulated patterns with both isomorphic and anamorphic optical proximity corrections (OPC) using the rigorous model. The study focuses on 3nm node Via layer designs. These vias need to connect to metal features which have pitches of 21 nm. Simulation results using 0.33 NA SP, 0.33 NA DP, and 0.55 NA anamorphic SP are presented. The benefit of using an alternative mask absorber and a thinner resist as well as the impact of stochastic effects have also been explored. Although a 0.55 NA EUV is expected to produce a superior image to 0.33 NA EUV and to have less impact from overlay errors and stochastic effects, an analysis of process margins of 0.33 NA EUV SD and DP versus 0.55 NA anamorphic systems helps to better understand the benefits, challenges and optimal insertion point for introducing High-NA EUV.", "With the announcement of the extension of the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) roadmap to a high NA lithography tool that utilizes anamorphic optics design, an investigation of design tradeoffs unique to the imaging of anamorphic lithography tool is shown. An anamorphic optical proximity correction (OPC) solution has been developed that models fully the EUV near field electromagnetic effects and the anamorphic imaging using the Domain Decomposition Method (DDM). Clips of imec representative for the N3 logic node were used to demonstrate the OPC solutions on critical layers that will benefit from the increased contrast at high NA using anamorphic imaging. However, unlike isomorphic case, from wafer perspective, OPC needs to treat x and y differently. In the paper, we show a design trade-off seen unique to Anamorphic EUV, namely that using a mask rule of 48nm (mask scale), approaching current state of the art, limitations are observed in the available correction that can be applied to the mask. The metal pattern has a pitch of 24nm and CD of 12nm. During OPC, the correction of the metal lines oriented vertically are being limited by the mask rule of 12nm 1X. The horizontally oriented lines do not suffer from this mask rule limitation as the correction is allowed to go to 6nm 1X. For this example, the masks rules will need to be more aggressive to allow complete correction, or design rules and wafer processes (wafer rotation) would need to be created that utilize the orientation that can image more aggressive features. When considering VIA or block level correction, aggressive polygon corner to corner designs can be handled with various solutions, including applying a 45 degree chop. Multiple solutions are discussed with the metrics of edge placement error (EPE) and Process Variation Bands (PVBands), together with all the mask constrains. Noted in anamorphic OPC, the 45 degree chop is maintained at the mask level to meet mask manufacturing constraints, but results in skewed angle edge in wafer level correction. In this paper, we used both contact (Via/block) patterns and metal patterns for OPC practice. By comparing the EPE of horizontal and vertical patterns with a fixed mask rule check (MRC), and the PVBand, we focus on the challenges and the solutions of OPC with anamorphic High-NA lens.", "In previous work, we have described how EUV scanner aberrations can be adequately simulated and corrected in OPC across the slit to deliver excellent edge placement control. The problem is that the level of aberration variability from tool to tool is currently quite significant and leads to uncorrectable edge placement errors if OPC is done using one tool while exposure happens on a different tool. In this study, we examine the impact of such edge placement errors for single patterning EUV exposure of metal and via layers with variable aberrations in projection lens systems. Two-layer combined CD and overlay edge placement hotspots can be compounded by aberrations which impact CDs and image shifts, and do so differently depending upon design pattern and pupil fill. Aberration values from current 3300 / 3350 EUV scanners are used and compared to hypothetical ideal tool with no aberrations and demonstrate very significant uncorrectable edge placement errors with current aberrations levels. The net result is a significant reduction in the metal-via combined CD-overlay process window.", "While 0.33NA EUV systems are readying to start volume manufacturing, ASML and Zeiss are ramping up development activities on a 0.55NA EUV exposure tool, extending Moore\u2019s law throughout the next decade. A novel, anamorphic lens design, has been developed to provide the NA; this lens will be paired with new, faster stages and more accurate sensors and the tight focus and overlay control needed for future process nodes. This paper presents an overview of the target specifications, key technology innovations and imaging simulations demonstrating the advantages as compared to 0.33NA and showing the capabilities of ASML\u2019s next generation EUV systems.", "With the introduction of the NXE:3400B scanner, ASML has brought EUV to High-Volume Manufacturing for sub10nm node lithography. And work has already been started on a successor high-NA system with NA=0.55. For both these systems, node resolution will go down faster than NA increases, resulting in decreasing k1-factors and tightening of aberration requirements. A crucial component for measuring and controlling aberrations in-situ is a diffuser to fill the full pupil of the projection optics appropriately.\nThis paper presents several new diffuser concepts, both reflective as well as transmissive, with their respective key performance metrics for both NA=0.33 and NA=0.55 EUV projection optics. These concepts can be used for measuring wavefront quality from dedicated fiducial plates, or for measuring directly from the imaging reticle. The latter would enable a combination of reticle alignment with lens aberration control without throughput penalty.\nIt will be shown that with these diffuser concepts, we have a solution for in-situ aberration control for 5nm nodes and below.", "Stochastic effects in extreme ultraviolet lithography are contributed by the EUV optical speckle and diffusion chemistry of the photoresist. These cause line edge roughness (LER) in the etched features, shrinking the process window at the sub-20nm lithography node. We explore possibilities of utilizing the speckle for optical metrology and resist characterization by measuring the latent image of the EUV light on photoresist. The latent image on a standard photoresist measured using atomic force microscopy is shown to linearly depend on the aerial image intensity within a specific dose range, hence serving as an in-situ imaging modality to measure the EUV aerial image without a camera. Potential applications include EUV wavefront measurement, resist characterization, and LER engineering.", "The semiconductor scaling roadmap shows the continuous node to node scaling to push Moore\u2019s law down to the next generations. In that context, the foundry N5 node requires 32nm metal pitch interconnects for the advanced logic Back- End of Line (BEoL). 193immersion usage now requires self-aligned and/or multiple patterning technique combinations to enable such critical dimension. On the other hand, EUV insertion investigation shows that 32nm metal pitch is still a challenge but, related to process flow complexity, presents some clear motivations.\nImec has already evaluated on test chip vehicles with different patterning approaches: 193i SAQP (Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning), LE3 (triple patterning Litho Etch), tone inversion, EUV SE (Single Exposure) with SMO (Source-mask optimization). Following the run path in the technology development for EUV insertion, imec N7 platform (iN7, corresponding node to the foundry N5) is developed for those BEoL layers.\nIn this paper, following technical motivation and development learning, a comparison between the iArF SAQP/EUV block hybrid integration scheme and a single patterning EUV flow is proposed. These two integration patterning options will be finally compared from current morphological and electrical criteria.", "Extreme ultra violet (EUV) patterning offers an opportunity to explore new hardmask materials and patterning approaches. Traditional patterning stacks for Deep UV (DUV) patterning have been based on optimizing multi-layer schemes for reflectivity control and pattern transfer. At EUV wavelength, the patterning challenges are dominated by stochastics and aspect ratio control. This offers an opportunity to think differently about underlayer design for sub-36nm pitch patterning. The choice of hardmask can be used to modulate post-litho defectivity to mitigate the stochastics effects and enable more efficient pattern transfer. Through different case studies this paper will explore a range of silicon-based inorganic hardmasks for sub36nm EUV patterning. How film properties dominate patterning performance will be studied systematically. The relative merits of patterning a chemically amplified organic resist directly on an inorganic hardmask or having different types of organic adhesion promoters as an intermediate layer will be also be presented.", "This paper assesses Self-Aligned Block (SAB) and Fully Self-Aligned Via (FSAV) approaches to patterning using a iN5 (imec node 5 nm) vehicle and Metal 2 Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning. We analyze SAB printability in the lithography process using process optimization, and demonstrate the effect of SAB on patterning yield for a (8 M2 lines x 6 M1 lines x 6 Via) structure. We show that FSAV, compared to standard Via patterning, has no beneficial impact but prevents dielectric breakdown between two adjacent M1 lines.", "LCDU (Local Critical Dimension Uniformity) is one of the biggest challenges in EUV lithography as well as throughput. High contrast illumination, so called, leaf hexapole illumination is proposed for staggered contact-hole array pattern. Leaf hexapole illumination shows much better LCDU compared with traditional hexapole illumination which has been used in DUV lithography so far. Stochastic noise model[1] which was developed based on the particle nature of photon is updated to supplement a missing term. Model prediction is well matched with experimental results in wide range of wafer CD and mask CD. Further optimization of LCDU and/or dose-to-size can be predicted through mask CD optimization. By using illumination optimization and mask CD optimization technique, EUV single exposure process can be applied below D1z node or beyond.", "Illumination source optimization is a very fundamental task in wafer lithography. By optimizing the incidence angles at the reticle, the combined diffraction behavior of mask and projection optics can be modified. One of the most critical parameter to control in EUV lithography is contrast at best and through focus as this drives the stochastic effects. In this work, we will look at the illumination source optimization for staggered CH and pillars for DRAM applications driven by fundamental considerations at diffraction level.", "The efficacy of OPC models depends on the ability to determine the physical dimensions of a large variety of photoresist patterns. This ability is impacted by a long observed phenomenon, photoresist shrinkage during CD-SEM metrology. As technology dimensions have scaled, the ability to directly measure the photoresist physical dimensions have diminished, while the need to reduce sources of uncertainty and error have increased. It has therefore become imperative to find other techniques to characterize this effect. In this paper, we compare methods of characterizing photoresist shrinkage of patterns using both etch-based and metrology-based approaches.", "EBL2 is TNO's platform for EUV exposure testing and surface analysis. EBL2 is capable of generating conditions relevant to EUV mask operation at all foreseen source power nodes.

The required gas, EUV, and thermal parameters will be considered, and related to simulated and measured performance of EBL2. This approach can also be applied to EUV pellicles and optics.", "For upcoming EUV high volume manufacturing, the EUV mask infrastructure plays a central role for its successful introduction. One of the key items in the EUV mask infrastructure is the need of manufacturing defect free photomasks for which an actinic mask review capability is a critical success factor. ZEISS and the SUNY POLY SEMATECH EUVL Mask Infrastructure consortium have developed and commercialized the EUV aerial image metrology system, the AIMS\u2122 EUV. In this paper we present the latest achievements of this AIMS\u2122 EUV platform together with data and analysis of LER/LWR measurements in the aerial image. We provide an overall project overview and discuss possible future extensions options based on this actinic metrology platform.", "The understanding, characterization and mitigation of 3D mask effects including telecentricity errors, contrast fading and best focus shifts becomes increasingly important for the performance optimization of future extreme ultraviolet (EUV) projection systems and mask designs. The scattering of light at the absorber edges results in significant phase deformations, which impact the effective phase and the lithographic performance of attenuated phase shift mask (attPSM) for EUV. We employ rigorous mask and imaging simulations in combination with multi-objective optimization techniques to identify the most appropriate material properties, mask and source geometries and to explore the potential of attPSMs for future EUV imaging.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is targeted for front-up insertion at advanced technology nodes but will be evaluated for back insertion at more mature nodes. EUVL can put two or more mask levels back on one mask, depending upon what level(s) in the process insertion occurs. In this paper, layout optimization methods are discussed that can be implemented when EUVL back insertion is implemented. The layout optimizations can be focused on improving yield, reliability or density, depending upon the design needs. The proposed methodology modifies the original two or more colored layers and generates an optimized single color EUVL layout design.", "Investigations into extreme ultraviolet lithograph (EEUVL) image formation of horizontal (perpendicular to the illumination angle) features have found asymmetric aerial images. This is an expected outcome of the off-axis chief ray angle (CRA)) illumination in the EUV lithography system. The asymmetry arises from interference effects in the mask multilayer stack as well as interactions with the mask absorber. The aerial image arriving at the wafer displays an asymmetric shape, which contributes too a reduced contrast on the dark-side absorber, while the light-side absorber contrast remains sharp. This is not the preferred situation as the low-contrast dark-side can lead to reduced imaging robustness during manufacturing.\nPreliminary studies show that mask absorber sidewall angle (SWA) impacts pattern formation partially through aerial image asymmetries. The light and dark-side of the absorbers form a standing wave in the gap between them due to absorber side wall reflection and corner scattering. The absorbers\u2019 standing waves further interact with the standing waves from the mask stack. Optimizing the absorber SWA is hypothesized to improve contrast thereby improving patterning robustness.\nThis study investigated the impact of absorber SWA on aerial image shape using simulation. The study was designed to understand if an optimal SWWA exists that improves patterning robustness in a manufacturing environment. CD, contrast, focus response, and other data were gathered and presented to understand the impact of SWA on patterning. From these simulated data, the possibility of an optimum SWA was explored.", "The term \u201cshot effect\u201d (schroteffekt) was coined in 1918 when Walter Schottky studied electrical noise in vacuum tubes. Earlier still, the foundations of shot noise theory go back to Einstein, who in 1905 explained the photoelectric effect as caused by discrete part particles of light and Brownian motion as caused by discrete particles of matter. When the numbers of particles that affect observable outcomes is large, shot noise effects (variability in number as a fraction of the mean number) becomes small and the continuum approximation (energy and matter are continuous) becomes accurate. For most of the history of semiconductor lithography, the continuum approximation has served well. But at small dimensional scales, where the number of discrete particles or events is small, the counting statistics of shot noise can dominate. The 100 year history of shot noise in science and engineering is today playing a role in our understanding of shot noise in lithography.", "We have been developing CO2-Sn-LPP EUV light source which is the most promising solution as the 13.5nm high power light source for HVM EUVL. Unique and original technologies such as; combination of pulsed CO2 laser and Sn droplets, dual wavelength laser pulses shooting and mitigation with magnetic field have been developed in Gigaphoton Inc.. We have developed first practical source for HVM; \u201cGL200E\u201d 17) in 2014. We have proved high average power CO2 laser more than 20kW at output power cooperate with Mitsubishi electric cooperation16). Pilot#1 is up running and its demonstrates HVM capability; EUV power recorded at111W average (117W in burst stabilized, 95% duty) with 5% conversion efficiency for 22hours operation in October 201621). Recently we have demonstrated, EUV power recorded at113W in burst stabilized (85W in average, 75% duty), with 5% conversion efficiency during 143hours operation. Also the Pilot#1 system recorded 64% availability and idle time was 25%.

Very low degradation (= - 0.4%/Gp) of actual collector mirror reflectance has been demonstrated above 100W level operation (in burst) with magnetic mitigation EUV source.", "EUV source power is critical for advanced lithography, for achieving economical throughput performance and also for minimizing stochastic patterning effects. Power conversion efficiency can be increased by recycling plasma-scattered laser radiation and other out-of-band radiation back to the plasma via retroreflective optics. Radiation both within and outside of the collector light path can potentially be recycled. For recycling within the collector path, the system uses a diffractive collection mirror that concomitantly filters all laser and out-of-band radiation out of the EUV output. In this paper we review the optical design concept for power recycling and present preliminary plasma-physics simulation results showing a potential gain of 60% in EUV conversion efficiency.", "A hydrogen plasma cleaning technique to clean Sn (tin) off EUV collector optics is studied in detail. The cleaning process uses hydrogen radicals and ions (formed in the hydrogen plasma) to interact with Sn-coated surfaces, forming SnH4 and being pumped away. This technique has been used to clean a 300mm-diameter stainless steel dummy collector optic, and EUV reflectivity of multilayer mirror samples was restored after cleaning Sn from them, validating the potential of this technology. This method has the potential to significantly reduce downtime and increase source availability. Thus, an investigation into the fundamental processes governing Sn removal has been performed. These experiments have shown that the Sn etch rates scale with hydrogen ion energy at the surface. Incident ions upon the surface impart energy that weakens the Sn-Sn bond allowing the chemical etch by hydrogen to proceed at a faster rate. Due to this the plasma is able to be in a reactive ion etch (RIE) regime. A concern for plasma based methods is the implantation of high energy hydrogen ions into the MLM, reducing reflectivity and possibly blistering. With a surface wave plasma (SWP) this concern is alleviated somewhat because of lower ion energies. Surface wave plasmas have lower electron temperatures than conventional sources in the range of 1 to 3 eV. In addition, SWP sources result in plasma densities on the order of 1011-12 cm-3, allowing for greater utilization of ion etch enhancement. Etch rates over 50 nm/min have been seen in the past. Preliminary results from experiments performed on the Illinois NXE:3100 chamber will be discussed.", "Emission of particle debris from the target of laser pumped plasma (LPP) extreme ultra-violet (EUV) light source is of the interest because that causes the contamination of the collector mirrors [1]. More recently, a high output power and efficiency has been achieved using the double pulse technique. Firstly, by irradiating the target with a short (ps) pre-pulse laser, a cloud of particles is produced. Secondly, the particles are irradiated by main CO2 laser, which absorb the energy efficiently to produce plasmas with an appropriate density and temperature for the EUV emission [2]. We develop a hydrodynamics simulation code based on the Lagrangian grid. We develop algorithms of reorganization of mesh dynamically according to the distribution of the material. The method allows one to calculate the dynamics of gas bubbles in the liquid phase and clusters in gas phase with a macroscopic scale (>100nm) [3]. Furthermore, the liquid-to-gas transition are taken into account and the ratio between liquid and gas phase for given temperature and density of the material are reproduced based on the Van-der-waals equation of state [4]. We investigated the temporal evolution of the density of a tin cylinder heated by a rate of 2.5 and 6 x 1012 W/mol. A critical heating rate is suggested below which the emission of particle debris takes place. It is shown that in the case of small heating rate, initially small bubbles appear, which grow in numbers and sizes, and eventually break the target into particles. In the case of large heating rate, target expands uniformly because the temperature of the target increases rapidly above the critical temperature. References [1] V.

The lithography community assumed that defect control for photomasks would be achieved, not with a pellicle, but with a clean scanner environment, thermophoretic protection and a removable pellicle.1 In 2006, Intel published their research on an EUV pellicle.2 Since then, an international development effort on EUV pellicle membranes has spanned a range of materials and fabrication approaches. Not only materials, but also the requirements of the EUV pellicle membrane have evolved over time. Imec\u2019s pellicle work based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) started in 2015, and is placed in relation to the rich history of EUV pellicles. CNTs are one-atom-thick carbon sheets rolled into tubes. The CNTs can be single- or multi-walled and can vary in diameter and in length. These engineered CNTs can be arranged in different configurations to form membranes of different densities. Thus, the CNT membrane\u2019s properties can be fundamentally changed to meet the EUV pellicle targets for properties like transmittance. The historical trends in EUV pellicle membrane development are presented and the CNT membranes are described in that context.", "Printability estimation of blank defects on an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask was examined by means of actinic darkfield imaging. A dedicated mask containing 64-nm line and space pattern was fabricated on a blank with known native blank defects. Actinic dark-field images of the defects on the patterned mask were obtained, and the defect signal intensities through focus were measured. The mask was printed through focus onto a wafer with an ASML NXE3300, and the wafer critical dimension (CD) deviations caused by the defect were obtained. A significant relationship is shown between the defect signal intensity and the wafer CD deviation, corresponding well with simulations. It was thus demonstrated that the wafer CD deviation can be estimated via the defect signal intensity on the mask in the actinic darkfield image.", "There are many applications where fast, accurate light scattering from EUV photomasks must be computed, including inverse mask design, actinic die-to-database inspection, and actinic scatterometry. However, so-called mask 3D effects make this calculation much more challenging than traditional optical lithography. These 3D effects arise from the optically thicker absorber, the lack of illumination symmetry about normal incidence, the multilayer mirror reflection function, and multiple scattering off the absorber. In this paper, we explore using actinic scatterometry at the CXRO EUV reflectometer to characterize both the multilayer and absorber of an EUV photomask; we then introduce the Multilayer Multiple Scattering (MLMS) mathematical model that conveniently separates the effects of the multilayer and the absorber and explore the implications of this model on the origins of mask 3D effects.", "For EUV photomasks, high-k absorber materials represent a potential strategy to effectively mitigate mask 3D effects which are getting more prominent as the scanners\u2019 NA increases.

Defect maps for each material are analyzed and compared.", "RESCAN is a metrology platform, currently under development at Paul Scherrer Institut to provide actinic inspection capability for EUV reticles. It is a lensless microscope and its defect detection protocol is based on coherent diffraction imaging. One of the key features of an actinic pattern inspection tool is the ability to operate on reticles protected by an EUV pellicle. Thanks to the absence of imaging optics in close proximity of the sample, there are no geometrical constraints preventing the inspection of a pellicle-protected reticle in RESCAN. Nevertheless, the defect detection sensitivity depends on the quality of the reconstructed images and it is therefore important to assess if and how these are affected by the presence of an EUV pellicle. We report here the results of an evaluation of the effects of different types of EUV pellicles on the reconstructed images. We observed that high-absorption silicon nitride pellicles significantly reduce the imaging quality whereas in the case of the CNT-based pellicles the imaging performance was not affected. We also observed no damage of the CNT-based pellicle. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful attempt to perform mask inspection through EUV pellicles.", "The viability of EUV lithography depends upon the accurate placement of hundreds of billions of features per field with critical dimensions less than 30 nm using a minimal photon count. In this photon-limited regime, resist absorbance, radiochemical blur, and nanoscale homogeneity have important impacts on stochastic variability and device yield not captured by standard resist characterization in terms of resolution, line-edge roughness and sensitivity (RLS). Multiple studies have shown that low-probability printing failures critical to device yield are not accurately modeled by 7\u03c3 extrapolations from the small populations of features commonly analyzed to extract RLS parameters. Inpria continues to advance the development of high-resolution photo-patternable metal oxide (MOx) hardmasks specifically designed to address these beyond-RLS requirements, and herein we examine the population statistics of large numbers of MOx resist pillars printed on a NXE 3300B scanner. Published experimental lithography data on large numbers of EUV-printed features is limited, even for conventional chemically amplified resists (CARs). Accurate metrology on many millions of features is a resource intensive proposition which partially explains the relative scarcity of these critical data. To address this deficiency, a metrology protocol for analysis of >10 million contact holes or pillars has been developed and applied to features printed using Inpria MOx resists. The stochastic variability of multiple large pillar populations is analyzed as a function of exposure conditions, resist, and process chemistry. By comparing these experimentally observed populations with contact hole populations derived from conventional chemically amplified resists (CARs) the stochastic limits of the respective resist chemistries are probed.", "This paper focusses on stochastic printing failures, such as microbridges in spaces or randomly missing contacts. We quantify such failures with a metric we call NOK (not OK), a metric that essentially represents the failure probability. We measure this NOK-quantity from SEM image analysis, using an in-house software package called Stochalis. We will argue that the most fundamental dependency of this failure probability is its CD dependency: NOK(CD). Using currently available CD-SEM or e-beam inspection tools, it is now possible to measure this NOK(CD) dependency down to the ppm-ppb level. This is not sufficient to prove or disprove yield, but the NOK(CD) function is an excellent tool to compare materials and conditions, i.e. to quantify sensitivities to patterning conditions and show directions for improvement. We will illustrate this with examples on the impact of dose, pitch, resist, etch and illumination mode. We will also show how CD non-uniformities, from very local to global, further affect the local failure probabilities. Finally we will argue that stochastic failure probabilities and CD-non-uniformities together, place practical resolution limits both on CD and on pitch. These limits are not absolute (which is why we call them \u2018practical limits\u2019) as they depend on the patterning settings and materials used, but they nevertheless need to be considered very carefully when setting up EUVL processes.", "As minimum lithographic size continues to shrink, the development of techniques and resist materials capable of high resolution, high sensitivity and low line edge roughness (LER) have become increasingly important for next-generation lithography.

We also present results obtained after enhancements of the base molecule to give high resolution, better LER, and a significant sensitivity enhancement of 40% over the standard material. Finally, we present the inclusion of non-metallic high-Z elements into the formulation to allow for a further reduction in LER at the same resolution and sensitivity as seen for the enhanced MTR molecule, indicating a direction for further improvements.", "In order to lower the cost of ownership of EUV lithography, high sensitivity EUV resists , enabling higher throughput of EUV scanners are being explored. The concept that utilizes a Photosensitized Chemically Amplified ResistTM (PSCARTM) is a promising solution for achieving increased resist sensitivity, while maintaining other high performance characteristics of the material (i.e., resolution, line edge roughness (LER), exposure latitude). PSCAR uses a UV exposure after EUV exposure and selective absorption to meet these goals . Preliminary results have been discussed in previous papers 1-8.\nPSCAR utilizes an area-selective photosensitization mechanism to generate more acid in the exposed areas during a UV exposure. PSCAR is an attempt to break the resolution, line-edge-roughness, and sensitivity trade-off (RLS trade-off) relationships that limit standard chemically amplified resists. The photosensitizer, which is generated in exposed area by a photoacid catalytic reaction, absorbs the UV exposure light selectively and generates additional acid in the exposed area only.\nMaterial development and UV exposure uniformity are the key elements of PSCAR technology for semiconductor mass fabrication.

Hence, it is important to understand and quantify the contribution of each of the stochastic effects to the edge roughness. In this work, various computational approaches are used based on the rigorous stochastic resist model in order to assess the stochastic contribution of photon absorption and random chemical reactions in EUV photoresist.\nThe simulation results are presented for both the traditional chemically amplified EUV resists and resists utilizing alternative mechanisms of image formation, such as metal based- resists.", "The performance of chemically amplified resist is approaching its physical limit with the reduction of feature sizes due to the acid diffusion needed for the solubility change of resist polymer. The line edge roughness (LER) of chemically amplified resists rapidly increases in the sub-10-nm-half-pitch region when the half-pitch is decreased. Also, the stochastic defect (pinching and bridges) generation is a significant concern for the high resolution patterning with high throughput. To solve these problems, the increase of the density of resist films is an important strategy. Metal oxide nanoparticle resists have attracted much attention as the next generation resist used for the high-volume production of semiconductor devices because of their high density property. However, the sensitization mechanism of the metal oxide nanoparticle resists is unknown. Understanding the sensitization mechanism is important for the efficient development of resist materials. In this study, the sensitization mechanism of ZrO2 nanoparticle resist was investigated. The numbers of electron-hole pairs required for the solubility change of the resist films were estimated for a ZrO2 nanoparticle and a ligand shell, respectively. The radiation chemistry of ligands was investigated using a pulse radiolysis method. The pulse radiolysis is a powerful method to directly observe the kinetics of short-lived intermediate produced by an ionizing radiation. In the material design of metal oxide nanoparticle resists, it is important to efficiently use the electron-hole pairs generated in nanoparticles for the chemical change of ligand molecules.

The main challenge for EUV resists is to simultaneously satisfy resolution, LWR (line-width roughness) and sensitivity requirements according to the ITRS roadmap1. Over the past few years, our main effort has been to focus on ZrO2 and HfO2 nanoparticle-based photoresists. However, both Zr and Hf are relatively low EUV absorbing metals2, and integration of high EUV absorption elements is considered to be a more promising route to further improve lithographic performance under EUV radiation. Here, we demonstrate novel zinc oxide-based nanoparticle photoresists, possessing small particle size, good solubility in spin-coating solvents, good film-forming abilitie and patterning by incorporating a photo-acid generator or photo-radical generator.", "MAPDST (4-(methacryloyloxy)phenyl)dimethylsulfoniumtrifluoromethanesulfonate)) based resist analogous are reported to pattern high-resolution nano features (20 nm) under wide range of lithography tools including electron beam lithography (EBL), extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), 193 nm immersion lithography etc. However, these resists have not yet patterned lower node features, especially at sub-15 nm regime with ultra-low line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR). One of the methods to improve the resolution of a resist is the structural modification. Towards this, we have developed two new hybrid copolymer resists i.e MAPDST-co-ADSM and MAPDST-co-TPMA by the copolymerization of radiation sensitive organic MAPDST with hybrid tin monomers ADSM and TPMA (ADSM = acetyldibutylstannyl methacrylate; TPMA = triphenyl tin methacrylate) for high-resolution EBL applications. The developed resists were studied for their sub-15 nm line patterns with low LER and LWR features. Various line features, starting from 30-12 nm with different line/space (L/S to L/10S) characteristics were studied at various e-beam doses 200- 1200 \u03bcC/cm2. Isolated 12 nm line features have been achieved with the resist MAPDST-co-ADSM at a dose 1200 \u03bcC/cm2. Meanwhile, the MAPDST-co-TPMA resist patterned 15 nm features at the dose 700 \u03bcC/cm2. The estimated sensitivity and contrast of resists MAPDST-co-ADSM and MAPDST-co-TPMA were 1.60; 450 \u03bcC/cm2 and 1.55; 380 \u03bcC/cm2 respectively. Similarly, the computed LER and LWR parameters exhibited by the resists MAPDST-co-ADSM and MAPDST-co-TPMA for sub-30 nm features were 0.99; 1.22 and 1.8; 3 nm respectively. The e-beam studies revealed a resolution enhancement of the hybrid resists at 12 nm regime as compared to the neat poly(MAPDST) resist (where the resist resolution was 20 nm) indicating improvements in the lithography properties of these resists.", "The main target of the current work was to develop new sensitive polymeric materials for lithographic applications, focusing in particular to EUV lithography, the main chain of which is cleaved under the influence of photogenerated acid. Resist materials based on the cleavage of polymer main chain are in principle capable to create very small structures, to the dimensions of the monomers that they consist of. Nevertheless, in the case of the commonly used nonchemically amplified materials of this type issues like sensitivity and poor etch resistance limit their areas of application, whereas inadequate etch resistance and non- satisfactory process reliability are the usual problems encountered in acid catalysed materials based on main chain scission. In our material design the acid catalyzed chain cleavable polymers contain very sensitive moieties in their backbone while they remain intact in alkaline ambient. These newly synthesized polymers bear in addition suitable functional groups for the achievement of desirable lithographic characteristics (thermal stability, acceptable glass transition temperature, etch resistance, proper dissolution behavior, adhesion to the substrate). Our approach for achieving acceptable etch resistance, a main drawback in other main chain cleavable resists, is based on the introduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in the polymeric backbone, whereas the incorporation of an inorganic component further enhances the etch resistance. Single component systems can also be designed following the proposed approach by the incorporation of suitable PAGs and base quencher molecules in the main chain. Resist formulations based on a random copolymer designed according to the described rules evaluated in EUV exhibit ultrahigh sensitivity, capability for high resolution patterning and overall processing characteristics that make them strong candidates for industrial use upon further optimization.", "Multilayer unit thickness variations in the multilayer extreme ultraviolet (EUV) reflector stack pose a difficult problem for generation of lithographic models for use in Optical Proximity Correction (OPC). The multilayer stack is ideally comprised of alternating layers of molybdenum and silicon. However, there are diffused interface regions between these layers that might have slight variations in thickness, reflectance, and absorption. These interface regions can differ within specified parameters based on variations in the deposition tool, resulting in EUV masks with minor differences in the multilayer. This is a difficult problem for OPC models, because slight variations in the multilayer can result in large variations in the feature printed on the wafer. Also, these stack variations are not precisely known for every reticle, rather a sample stack is used to gather data from a cross section of a representative reticle.\nThis study explores the relationship between EUV mask stack reflectivity and horizontal to vertical pattern bias. In this computational study, the MoSi2 thickness is varied at systematic locations in the mask stack, then data on horizontal to vertical bias (H to V bias) for multiple features are gathered. The data will be used to understand the relationship between mask substrate reflectance, mask material thickness, and H to V bias. The study will also investigate the impact of high numerical aperture (0.55 NA anamorphic) imaging on the final H to V bias. Initial work indicates that a 1% variation in substrate reflectance results in approximately a 4% variation in CD.", "To explore the potential of achieving low-stress and high-reflectance Mo/Si multilayers deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering with bias assistance, we investigated the effects of varying Ar gas pressure, substrate bias voltage and bias-assisted Si ratio on the stress and EUV reflectance of Mo/Si multilayers. To reduce the damage of ion bombardments on Si-on-Mo interface, only final part of Si layer was deposited with bias assistance. Bias voltage has strong influence on the stress. The compressive stress of Mo/Si multilayers can be reduced remarkably by increasing bias voltage due to the increase of Mo-on-Si interdiffusion and postponement of Mo crystallization transition. Properly choosing gas pressure and bias-assisted Si ratio is critical to obtain high EUV reflectance. Appropriately decreasing gas pressure can reduce the interface roughness without increasing interdiffusion. Too much bias assistance can seriously reduce the optical contrast between Mo and Si layers and lead to a remarkable decrease of EUV reflectance. Thus, by appropriately choosing gas pressure, bias voltage and bias-assisted Si ratio, the stress values of Mo/Si multilayers can be reduced to the order of -100 MPa with an EUV reflectance loss of about 1%.", "EUV lithography is nowadays considered as one of the most feasible choices for high volume manufacturing. In this work, we wish to report a series of studies aiming at shedding more light on the development mechanism of metal based EUV hybrid photoresists. We have studied zirconium (Zr) and hafnium (Hf) based hybrid resists which have shown high sensitivity, they suffer though from scumming issues. On the other hand, our clusters based on zinc (Zn) which absorbs strongly in EUV seem to be free of scumming but still Zr and Hf outperform in terms of sensitivity. In an effort to understand better what controls sensitivity and scumming phenomena we have employed a combination of analytical techniques (Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ESI-MS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS, and Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR) to study the patterning mechanism in detail, in order to be able to optimize the development process and develop systems with optimal features.", "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is getting closer to practical use for mass production every year. For applying EUV lithography to manufacturing, productivity improvement is a critical challenge. Throughput and yield are important factors for productivity. EUV source power is steadily advancing year by year, bringing improvements in throughput. Furthermore, yield improvement is necessary for productivity enhancement. In order to improve the yield in EUV lithography processing, further improvement of defectivity and critical dimension (CD) uniformity is required. One of the initial layers to be printed with EUV will be contact hole, therefore, we are concentrating on the productivity improvements of that layer.\nIn our report at SPIE 2017, defect reduction was achieved using the latest rinse technology in the development process and in-film defectivity was improved with material dispense optimization on a 24 nm contact hole (CH) pattern. On the basis of the knowledge acquired from the previous evaluation, improvements have been taken a step further in this next evaluation. As a result, 96% of residue defect reduction and 42% of in -film particle defect reduction has been achieved by further rinse optimization and improvement of dispense system.\nFor the other aspect of yield improvement, CD uniformity control is one of the crucial factors. CD variations are comprised of several components such as wafer to wafer CD uniformity, field to field CD uniformity. To achieve CD uniformity target for manufacturing, we have optimized developing process with the latest technology. Then, 15% of field to field CD uniformity improvement and significant improvement of wafer to wafer CD uniformity are achieved.", "As EUV lithography moves toward high-volume manufacturing phase, one of the key factors determining the throughput and yield is the resist performance, i.e. resolution, sensitivity, and line-edge roughness. At Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), we extensively work on EUV resist performance issues. For this purpose, we use the PSI\u2019s EUV interference lithography (IL) tool in which a coherent beam with 13.5 nm wavelength is used to produce a well-defined periodic aerial image with virtually 100% contrast and large depth-of-focus. In this study, we report our recent results on the printability of high-resolution lines/spaces pattern down to 11 nm half-pitch (HP) with a chemically amplified resist (CAR). Although we demonstrate well-resolved 11 nm HP patterning, further improvement of the CAR\u2019s performance in terms of pattern collapse and line-edge roughness is needed. Moreover, these results are achieved with EUV-IL tool which has a fundamentally different aerial image formation than the NXE scanner. Although EUV-IL is a powerful tool to evaluate the resist\u2019s ultimate patterning capabilities for early optimization, what is ultimately important is the performance under manufacturing conditions, i.e. at the scanner. Therefore, we address this issue by evaluating the resist performance as a function of the contrast and resolution of the aerial image in a controlled manner, which is possible with the EUV-IL tool. In addition, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art EUV resists using EUV-IL tool and NXE scanner and attempt to match the data obtained from EUV-IL with the performance of the NXE scanners.", "For years, Moore\u2019s law keeps driving the semiconductors industry towards smaller dimensions and higher density chips with more devices. Earlier, the correlation between exposure source\u2019s wave length and the smallest resolvable dimension, mandated the usage of Deep Ultra-Violent (DUV) optical lithography system which has been used for decades to sustain Moore\u2019s law, especially when immersion lithography was introduced with 193nm ArF laser sources. As dimensions of devices get smaller beyond Deep Ultra-Violent (DUV) optical resolution limits, the need for Extremely Ultra-Violent (EUV) optical lithography systems was a must. However, EUV systems were still under development at that time for the mass-production in semiconductors industry. Theretofore, Multi-Patterning (MP) technologies was introduced to swirl about DUV optical lithography limitations in advanced nodes beyond minimum dimension (CD) of 20nm. MP can be classified into two main categories; the first one is to split the target itself across multiple masks that give the original target patterns when they are printed. This category includes Double, Triple and Quadruple patterning (DP, TP, and QP). The second category is the Self-Aligned Patterning (SAP) where the target is divided into Mandrel patterns and non-Mandrel patterns. The Mandrel patterns get printed first, then a self-aligned sidewalls are grown around these printed patterns drawing the other non-Mandrel targets, afterword, a cut mask(s) is used to define target\u2019s line-ends. This approach contains Self-Aligned-Double Pattering (SADP) and Self-Aligned- Quadruple-Pattering (SAQP). DUV and MP along together paved the way for the industry down to 7nm. However, with the start of development at the 5nm node and the readiness of EUV, the differentiation question is aroused again, which pattering approach should be selected, direct printing using EUV or DUV with MP, or a hybrid flow that contains both DUV-MP and EUV.\nIn this work we are comparing two potential pattering techniques for Back End Of Line (BEOL) metal layers in the 5nm technology node, the first technique is Single Exposure EUV (SE-EUV) with a Direct Patterning EUV lithography process, and the second one is Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning (SAQP) with a hybrid lithography processes, where the drawn metal target layer is decomposed into a Mandrel mask and Blocks/Cut mask, Mandrel mask is printed using DUV 193i lithography process, while Block/Cut Mask is printed using SE-EUV lithography process. The pros and cons of each technique are quantified based on Edge-Placement-Error (EPE) and Process Variation Band (PVBand) measured at 1D and 2D edges. The layout used in this comparison is a candidate layout for Foundries 5nm process node.", "To improve EUV resist sensitivity, studies have sought to enhance EUV light absorption by adding metals characterized by high EUV light absorption to the resist polymer. This approach is intended to increase secondary electron emission, thereby enhancing PAG reactivity and improving acid generation efficiency. As reported in our previous report, to determine whether adding metals characterized by high EUV light absorption actually enhances sensitivity, we performed transmittance measurements and sensitivity evaluations of resist samples doped with ZrO2 or TeO2 nanoparticles, which have low and high EUV light absorption, respectively, in molar quantities of 0-2 relative to PAG. The samples were subjected to EUV exposure at the NewSUBARU synchrotron radiation facility. The results of transmittance measurements and sensitivity evaluations showed that, while the ZrO2-doped resist showed no changes in absorption or sensitivity, the TeO2-doped resist showed enhancement in both properties. Based on these results, we confirmed that adding metals characterized by high EUV light absorption to the EUV resist enhances its EUV light absorption and increases secondary electron emission, thereby enhancing PAG reactivity and improving acid generation efficiency. In the efforts discussed in the present report, we examined whether adding metals directly to PAG could further enhance sensitivity by increasing the EUV light absorption of PAG itself, thereby efficiently heightening the effect of the secondary electron emission on PAG.", "The 5nm technology node introduces more aggressive geometries than previous nodes. In this paper, we are introducing a comprehensive study to examine the pattering limits of EUV at 0.33NA. The study is divided into two main approaches: (A) Exploring pattering limits of Single Exposure EUV Cut/Block mask in Self-Aligned-Multi-Patterning (SAMP) process, and (B) Exploring the pattering limits of a Single Exposure EUV printing of metal Layers.\nThe printability of the resulted OPC masks is checked through a model based manufacturing flow for the two pattering approaches. The final manufactured patterns are quantified by Edge Placement Error (EPE), Process Variation Band (PVBand), soft/hard bridging and pinching, Image Log Slope (ILS) and Common Depth of Focus (CDOF)", "Thermal and structural deformations of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) masks during the exposure process may become important issues as these masks are subject to rigorous image placement and flatness change. The reflective masks used for EUVL absorb energy during exposure, and the temperature of the mask rises as a result. This can cause thermomechanical deformation that can reduce the pattern quality. Therefore, it is necessary to predict and optimize the effect of energy transmitted from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source and the resultant patterns of complex multilayer structured EUV masks. Our study shows that temperature accumulation and deformation of the EUV mask are dependent on the absorber structure.", "Semiconductor manufacturing industry has reduced the size of wafer for enhanced productivity and performance, and Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) light source is considered as a promising solution for downsizing. A series of EUV lithography procedures contain complex photo-chemical reaction on photoresist, and it causes technical difficulties on constructing theoretical framework which facilitates rigorous investigation of underlying mechanism. Thus, we formulated finite difference method (FDM) model of post exposure bake (PEB) process on positive chemically amplified resist (CAR), and it involved acid diffusion coupled-deprotection reaction. The model is based on Fick\u2019s second law and first-order chemical reaction rate law for diffusion and deprotection, respectively. Two kinetic parameters, diffusion coefficient of acid and rate constant of deprotection, which were obtained by experiment and atomic scale simulation were applied to the model. As a result, we obtained time evolutional protecting ratio of each functional group in resist monomer which can be used to predict resulting polymer morphology after overall chemical reactions. This achievement will be the cornerstone of multiscale modeling which provides fundamental understanding on important factors for EUV performance and rational design of the next-generation photoresist.", "The constant improvement of critical pitch reduction to enable the next generation semiconductor technology node is the primary driver for innovation in semiconductor industry. Previous researches [1] have shown the benefits of EUVL to bring down the wafer manufacturing cost for imec 7nm technology node. Beyond the technology node (N node) that will use EUV single patterning to enable the critical layers, the critical pitch enablement would require the second generation of EUVL lithography (high NA EUV) or double patterning EUVL(EUVL-DP). In this paper, we have provided a comparison between the two alternatives in terms of cost. We explored patterning options that would enable a costfriendly 5nm logic (N+1 node). The goal is to analyze the alternatives beyond the current 0.33 NA EUVL single patterning limit.", "In this paper, we provide an overview of various technologies for scaling tin laser-produced-plasma (LPP) extremeultraviolet (EUV) source performance to enable high volume manufacturing (HVM). We will show improvements to source architecture that facilitated the increase of EUV power from 100W to 250W, and the technical challenges for power scaling of key source parameters and subsystems. The performance of critical subsystems such as the Droplet Generator and Collector protection will be shown, with emphasis on stability and lifetime. Finally, we will describe current research activities and provide a perspective for LPP EUV sources towards 500W.", "Gigaphoton Inc. is developing a laser produced plasma (LPP) extreme ultra violet (EUV) light source for high-volumemanufacturing (HVM) semiconductor lithography. Original technologies and key components of this source include a high-power carbon dioxide (CO2) laser with 15ns pulse duration, a short wavelength solid-state pre-pulse laser with 10ps pulse duration, a highly stabilized small droplet (DL) target, a precise laser-DL shooting control system and debris mitigation technology with a magnetic field. In this paper, an update of the development progress of the total system and of the key components is presented.", "As the pitch approaches the 10nm node, in order to meet current and future patterning challenges, high resolution techniques are required, complementary to extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) for high volume manufacturing of nanodevices. These complementary techniques should have the following specifications: 1) High patterning resolution, below 10 nm; 2) capability of patterning in 3D; 3) sufficient wafer-scale throughput; 4) the capability of closed loop metrology and 5) the capability of measuring nondestructively through layers, for alignment and overlay applications.\nScanning probe microscopy (SPM) has shown a great degree of nano-scale control, and a great potential to address the challenges found in metrology. There has been a broad development of SPM-based methods for patterning and metrology purposes although its exploitation for technological applications is limited due to the modest throughput of scanning probe based techniques. In this article we present experimental results that include the proof-of-principle of using SSURFM to locate existing buried nanopatterns (lines of 50 nm) and subsequently using our patterning technology to manufacture nanocontact holes aligned to the existing buried lines. In combination with the high throughput parallel scanning probe, this example demonstrates the great potential and the suitability of the group of technologies developed at TNO (consisting of the patterning and the subsurface nanoimaging) for alignment and overlay, especially through opaque layers.", "The search of novel tools controlling the physical and chemical properties of matter at the nanoscale is crucial for developing next-generation integrated systems, with applications ranging from computing to medicine. Here, we show that thermal scanning probe lithography (t-SPL) can be a flexible tool for manipulating with nanoscale precision the surface properties of a wide range of specifically designed systems. In particular, we show that via t-SPL, we pattern nanoscale chemical patterns on polymeric substrates, which are then used to specifically bind extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to the polymer surface. We demonstrate that the concentration of immobilized proteins can be controlled by varying the tip temperature, so that nanoscale protein gradients can be created. On a different system, we show that, by performing t-SPL on a thin film magnetic multilayer, in an external magnetic field, we are able to write reversibly magnetic patterns with arbitrarily oriented magnetization and tunable magnetic anisotropy. This demonstrates that t-SPL represents a novel, straightforward and extremely versatile method for the nanoscale engineering of the physicalchemical properties in a wide variety of materials.", "Cost-effective generation of single-digit nano-lithographic features could be the way by which novel nanoelectronic devices, as single electron transistors combined with sophisticated CMOS integrated circuits, can be obtained. The capabilities of Field-Emission Scanning Probe Lithography (FE-SPL) and reactive ion etching (RIE) at cryogenic temperature open up a route to overcome the fundamental size limitations in nanofabrication. FE-SPL employs Fowler-Nordheim electron emission from the tip of a scanning probe in ambient conditions. The energy of the emitted electrons (<100 eV) is close to the lithographically relevant chemical excitations of the resist, thus strongly reducing proximity effects. The use of active, i.e. self-sensing and self-actuated, cantilevers as probes for FE-SPL leads to several promising performance benefits. These include: (1) Closed-loop lithography including pre-imaging, overlay alignment, exposure, and post-imaging for feature inspection; (2) Sub-5-nm lithographic resolution with sub-nm line edge roughness; (3) High overlay alignment accuracy; (4) Relatively low costs of ownership, since no vacuum is needed, and ease-of-use. Thus, FE-SPL is a promising tool for rapid nanoscale prototyping and fabrication of high resolution nanoimprint lithography templates. To demonstrate its capabilities we applied FE-SPL and RIE to fabricate single electron transistors (SET) targeted to operate at room temperature. Electrical characterization of these SET confirmed that the smallest functional structures had a diameter of only 1.8 nanometers. Devices at single digit nano-dimensions contain only a few dopant atoms and thus, these might be used to store and process quantum information by employing the states of individual atoms.", "Multicolor photolithography using visible light holds the promise of achieving wafer-scale patterning at pitches on the 10 nm scale. Although substantial progress has been made on multicolor techniques, a number of challenges remain to be met before the ultimate resolution of these methods can be reached. These challenges include the development of improved materials, creation of high-quality thin films, transitioning to exposure schemes that rely completely on linear absorption, scaling up to large-area patterning, and developing methods for effective pattern transfer. This paper discusses the state of the art in multicolor photolithography, presents some of the most recent advances in this field, and examines the prospects moving forward.", "Over the past few decades, the semiconductor industry has been employing size shrinkage as the most efficient method to reduce production cost in order to fit more and more transistors on one unit area. Each size shrinkage has been categorized as either node or generation by the theoretical gate length of Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET). In the advanced node, such as the sub-10nm node, size shrinkage is not applicable due to the physics limitation of 193nm immersion lithography. Therefore, alternative methods, extreme ultra violet lithography (EUV) and multi-patterning solutions based on 193nm immersion lithography, are attracting significant attentions in research and development across the industry. Among the various patterning techniques, the front-runner is self-aligned multiple patterning (SAMP). This technique uses the sidewall spacer formation as a transferable pattern and achieve pitch halving purpose. By repeating this technique, the pitch halving can be executed countless times, theoretically; this gives this technique an advantage over other techniques. However, due to the device design and sidewall formation in both sides, an additional line cut step is required to be performed to fulfill the requirements of isolation and N/P boundaries. The most challenging pattern in the line cut step is the single line cut without defect formation.", "Patterning of the resist features down to 10 nm node is crucial for futuristic integrated circuits (ICs) technology advancements. In this regard, we design and developed a novel hybrid non-chemically amplified resist (n-CAR) i.e. MAPDST-co-ADSM (where MAPDST = (4-(methacryloyloxy)phenyl) dimethylsulfonium trifluoromethanesulfonate and ADSM = (acetyldibutylstannyl methacrylate)) for high-resolution Helium Ion (He+) Beam Lithography (HIBL) studies. The developed resist exhibits the high sensitivity toward Helium ion radiation and patterned sub-15 nm features at the dose \u223c50 \u03bcC/cm2 onto negative tone resist formulation. In order to recognize the critical dimension (CD), the resist thin films were analyzed for single pixel exposure dose analysis at He+ exposure dose ranging from \u223c30 pC/cm to \u223c100 pC/cm. These investigations apparently reveal that 10 nm single pixel line features of the MAPDST-co-ADSM resist is patterned with the dose \u223c50.48 pC/cm. The improved patterning resolution of the resist down to 10 nm is due to the inclusion of hybrid tin sensitizer in the resist structures. The MAPDST-co-ADSM showed coherent line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) values for 15 nm lines features as \u223c1.67\u00b10.27 nm and \u223c2.20 nm respectively.\nMonte Carlo-based simulation technique is a standard method for statistical analysis and modelling of stochastic processes; such as noise in circuits, carrier transport and study of ion implantation/interaction/trajectory on materials for integrated circuits. Thus Monte Carlo ion trajectory simulation for MAPDST-co-ADSM resist formulation showed that the negligible (\u223c0.5%) target damage and recoil generation (atom displacement) of total energy delivered to the system (MAPDST-co-ADSM/Si) in novel HIBL exposure due to much larger stopping power of He+ ion and low proximity effect.", "Directed Self Assembly (DSA) of block-copolymers (BCPs) is considered as a cost-effective solution to extend the performances of conventional lithography. In this work, we propose a smart surface modification technique to precisely control the surface affinity of guiding template used in the DSA graphoepitaxy process flows. The presented method consists in the UV irradiation of copolymers brushes in order to locally tune their surface affinity. By this way, we are able to differentiate the surface affinities of guide sidewalls (PMMA-attractive) and guide bottom (non-preferential affinity). A complete DSA-module is demonstrated and implemented on a 300mm integration flow dedicated to the creation of silicon nanowires-like transistor.", "CH (Contact hole) patterning by DSA (Directed Self-Assembly) of BCP (Block Copolymer) is still attracting interest from the semiconductor industry for its CH repair and pitch multiplication advantages in sub-7nm nodes. For several years, extensive studies on DSA CH patterning have been carried out and significant achievements have been reported in materials and process optimization, CMOS integration and design compatibility and advanced characterization [1-4]. According to these studies, if a common agreement was clearly made for the use of PS-b-PMMA material as a potential candidate for DSA CH patterning integration in advanced nodes, the associated guiding template material was not yet selected and is still under investigation. Whereas the most reported guiding template materials for DSA PS-b-PMMA CH patterning are organic-based (resist or organic hard mask), we propose in this work to investigate a DSA process based on inorganic template material (silicon oxide based). Indeed, this latter offers some advantages over organic template: better surface affinity control, higher thermal stability during BCP self-assembly annealing, easier 3D-morphology imaging of DSA patterns and the possibility of wafer rework after the DSA step. The inorganic template based DSA process was first optimized using the planarization approach [5]. We demonstrated that the silicon oxide thickness should be properly adjusted to allow a good control of the BCP thickness over different guiding template densities. Afterwards, we compared the DSA performances (critical dimension: CD; CD uniformity: CDU, contact misalignment and defectivity) between both inorganic and organic template approaches. Equivalent results were obtained as shown in Figure 1. Finally, we demonstrated that inorganic template allows the rework of DSA wafers: similar CD and CDU for both guiding and DSA patterns were obtained after 3 cycles of rework (Figure 2).", "Since the 1960's, e-beam direct write has been left standing at the altar of new nodes, hoping to cross the threshold into the fab... And it's not because optical is for fab lithographers what an Alfa Romeo was for The Graduate.* It has to do with the economics of Moore's Law and what it takes for novel patterning technologies to meet its criteria. The barriers to e-beam making it into the fab have been a complex interplay of economics, technology, and the social psychology of the fab. This keynote dovetails the author\u2019s plenary talk, showing why this is the case. So, what\u2019s kept e-beam in play over the decades? As Frank Abboud pointed out so well in his 2018 plenary, investments in e-beam for direct-write have had the side benefit of making feasible the mask making technology needed for optical. So, the same question stays in play: Will e-beam cross the threshold to the fab after all these years? After all, that Alfa Romeo has grown to be very expensive over the years. The presentation will address these questions and conclude with an assessment of the economics needed to take Novel Patterning Technologies across the threshold to become new production realities.\n* The title is an homage to the 1966 movie The Graduate", "Mapper has installed its first product, the FLX\u20131200, at CEA-Leti in Grenoble (France). This is a maskless lithography system, based on massively parallel electron-beam writing with high-speed optical data transport for switching the electron beams. The FLX-1200, containing 65,000 parallel electron beams in a 13mm x 2mm electron optics slit, is capable of patterning any resolution and any different type of structure all the way down to 28 nm node patterns. As of August 2017 the FLX-1200 has a fully operational electron optics column, including a 65,000 beam blanker. In this paper the latest technical achievements of the FLX-1200 have been described: beam current is at 80% of FLX-1300 target (85 minutes per wafer).

It is designed to accomplish high resolution with 10-nm beam and high throughput with 300-Gbps blanking aperture array (BAA) and inline real-time data path. It has better beam resolution than EBM-9500 and has higher throughput at shot count more than 500 Gshot/pass. To further improve patterning resolution, pixel level dose correction (PLDC) is implemented to MBM-1000. It performs dose contrast enhancement by dose modulation pixel by pixel. Correction efficiency of PLDC is evaluated for linearity correction by simulation with threshold dose model. It is concluded that PLDC corrects linearity efficiently even without extra dose modulation, and improves dose margin with additional dose modulation of 140%.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block co-polymers (BCPs) is a next-generation lithography technique that shows promise for extending Moore\u2019s Law into the 10 nm regime and below. The minimum size of the features that can be produced by BCPs is controlled by the interaction parameter (chi) and the degree of polymerization (N). We have developed silicon containing BCPs for sub-20 nm line-and-space lithography. These BCPs were synthesized by living anionic polymerization, thermally annealed in thin films between neutral layers to generate the requisite perpendicular orientation [1, 2]. The silicon-containing blocks provide excellent development contrast under both oxidizing and reducing reactive ion etching (RIE) conditions. The developed patterns work well as masks for transfer of the developed patterns into useful substrate materials [3]. Through optimizing the design of the block copolymers and the \u201chybrid\u201d DSA process [1], we have now obtained 10 nm full pitch gratings. Recently we have studied silicon containing BCPs that incorporate a poly(2-vinylpyridine) block as a path to achieving still higher chi. For example, we have synthesized poly(4-pentamethyldisilylstyrene-block-2-vinylpyridine) (PDSS-b-P2VP) and found that this material has a chi parameter that is significantly higher than that of the BCP used for 10 nm lithography, meaning that even smaller feature sizes should be possible. Neutral top coats and cross-linked surface treatment layers were identified for PDSS-b-P2VP using the island and hole techniques that have been described previously [5]. We have succeeded in demonstrating 8 nm full pitch finger print patterns that are oriented perpendicular to the substrate. These are the smallest patterns we have managed to obtain in our system to date. 1. Blachut, G., et al. Chem. Mater (2016), 28 (24), 8951-8961. 2. Bates C. M., et al.

In this study, using post-DSA membrane fabrication technique and STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) tomography we were able to characterize the 3D structures of BCP in graphoepitaxial DSA hole shrink process. Different DSA structures of singlets formed in templated holes with different surface chemistry and geometry were successfully captured and their 3D shapes were reconstructed from tomography data. The results reveal that strong PS-preferential sidewalls are necessary to create vertical DSA cylinders and that template size outside of process window could result in defective DSA results in three dimensions. Our study as well as the established 3D metrology would greatly help to develop a fundamental understanding of the key DSA factors for optimization of the graphoepitaxial hole shrink process.", "The progress of using DSA for metal cut to achieve sub-20nm tip-to-tip (t2t) critical dimension (CD) is reported. Small and uniform t2t CD is very challenging due to lithographic limitation but holds the key to backend-of-the-line (BEOL) scaling. An integration scheme is demonstrated that allows the combination of design flexibility and fine, rectified local CD uniformity (LCDU). The combined effect of LCDU and centroid jittering will be discussed and compared to a hole shrink process using atomic layer deposition and spacer formation. The learning from this case study can provide perspectives that may not have been investigated thoroughly in the past. By including more important elements during DSA process development, such as metal cut, the DSA maturit y can be further advanced and move DSA closer to HVM adoption.", "Directed self-assembly (DSA) is one of the candidates for next generation lithography. Over the past years, many papers and presentation have been reported regarding DSA, and Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL is a registered trademark or a trademark of Tokyo Electron Limited in Japan and /or other countries.) also has presented the evaluation results and the advantages of each1-6. Especially, the chemo-epitaxy process has advantages for the sub 20nm line & space patterns to apply to DRAM active area, Logic fin and narrow metal patterns. One of the biggest advantages of DSA lines is that the pattern pitch is decided by the specific factors of the block copolymer, and it achieves the small pitch walking as a consequence. On the other hand, the chemo-epitaxy process can be applied to the hexagonal close-packed arrangement holes6. Those holes are expected to be the patterns for DRAM storage.\nIn this report, we present the latest results regarding the defect reduction and LER improvement work regarding chemoepitaxy line & space pattern. In addition, we update the evaluation results regarding chemo-epitaxy hole pattern.", "In recent years, Directed-Self Assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) has gained relevance as a promising \u2018bottomup\u2019 technique to produce nano-lithographic patterns. To make DSA a reliable and robust technique, much of the research is focused on reducing defectivity and mitigating Line Edge Roughness (LER) and Line Width Roughness (LWR) of the pre-and post-etched polymer blocks. High roughness values often inhibit the smooth functioning of the transistors by constraining the electron flow through the spaced channels. It is thus crucial to develop novel modeling and simulations techniques for DSA to harness the full potential of this technique and thus meet the ITRS roadmap LER standards. In our recent work, we have outlined our CGMD framework and the subsequent etching methodology used to produce line space patterns created by lamellae forming polystyrene-block-polymethyl methacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) with periods of about 28 nm, on a patterned Liu-Nealey (LiNe) flow substrate. In this paper, we present a comparative study of the experimental LER / LWR calculations with our coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation results. We employ highly parallelized supercomputing resources on a full-scale system with a detailed topographical substrate and exact matching of the BCP molecular weight. The simulations offer us a 3-D profile of the BCP domains and the subsequent resist pattern formed after etching, thus providing us with roughness estimates across the film thickness for three process stages: anneal, pre-etch and post-etch. Additionally, we also evaluate the edge morphology in the Fourier domain by generating power spectral density curves.", "Material challenges for DSA Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) of block copolymers are accompanied by processing automation and throughput complexity for successful implementation into manufacturing. Our goal was to address the ability of this complementary lithography technique to offer streamlining with respect to thermal anneal time, lowering it from hours to minutes. In addition, the standard high temperature anneal at 250-270\u02daC was decreased to 160-180\u02daC with low levels of defects measured. This DSA requirement designed to shift to low temperatures for thermal annealing is primarily due to low Tg monomers incorporated into the copolymer blocks. Chemoepitaxy DSA processes can be simplified significantly with more potential as a result of lower Tg. 193i nm lithography continues to be utilized for creating guiding patterns that provide the ability to achieve pattern density multiplication and defect rectification. In parallel, we are providing additional chemistry enhancement techniques for feature sizes <10 nm by improving wet etch pattern transfer capability specifically targeted to mitigate pattern collapse. Dry etch process steps for removal of one block, followed by pattern transfer into hard mask layers are enhanced with the incorporation of monomers into the PS block of the high chi BCP with the intent to minimize issues due to low selectivity values. Etch selectivity has been increased from 3:1 to 6:1 with customizing the copolymer blocks. Due to the fact that the practical application of high chi DSA continues to face technical and material challenges in comparison to standard PS-b-PMMA process steps, BSI achieved low temperature and short time block copolymer annealing with the innovation of material enhancement chemistry. Specially designed materials have been developed to improve material robustness for pattern fidelity after etching multi-stack spin on layers for DSA requirements. We have enabled the extension of the functionality and capability of our block copolymer (BCP) materials in order to easily transfer a DSA flow into manufacturing in addition to no need for top-coat or solvent annealing to get perpendicular orientation as we reported before1.", "Nanoimprint lithography, NIL, is gathering much attention as one of the most promising candidates for the next generation lithography for semiconductor. The advantages of NIL are simpler exposure system with no coat/dev track, single process step without SADP/SAQP, less design rule restriction, lower cost-of-ownership, compared with other lithography technologies. NIL working templates are made by the replication of the EB written high quality master templates. Fabrication of high resolution master templates is one of the key items. Since NIL is 1:1 pattern transfer process, master templates have to have 4 times higher resolution compared with conventional photomasks. Another key is to maintain the quality of the master templates in replication process. NIL process is applied for the template replication and this imprint process determines most of the performance of the replicated templates. Application of multi-beam mask writer, MBMW, to the NIL master template fabrication is very attractive. For a fine feature master template such as 1z nm node, shot count for writing with single beam tool will drastically increase and the writing time is estimated more than days. On the other hand, because of the parallel exposure principle, MBMW can write a master in a certain time for any feature size. In addition, MBMW is suitable for high resolution low sensitivity EB resist, which is evitable for fine feature master fabrication. We applied MBMW for the fabrication of full-field master of 1z nm node. In this presentation, we will be discussing master template fabrication process with MBMW and the performance of the template. We will also discuss the replication process with a high resolution master.", "Nanoimprint lithography manufacturing equipment utilizes a patterning technology that involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate. The patterned mask is lowered into the fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. The technology faithfully reproduces patterns with a higher resolution and greater uniformity compared to those produced by photolithography equipment. Additionally, as this technology does not require an array of widediameter lenses and the expensive light sources necessary for advanced photolithography equipment, NIL equipment achieves a simpler, more compact design, allowing for multiple units to be clustered together for increased productivity.\nIn this paper, we review the progress and status of the FPA-1100NR2 mask replication system and also discuss the methods used on wafer imprint systems to extend the life of a replica mask. Criteria that are crucial to the success of a replication platform include image placement (IP) accuracy and critical dimension uniformity (CDU). Data is presented on both of these subjects. With respect to image placement, an IP accuracy (after removing correctables) of 0.8nm in X, 1.0nm in Y has been demonstrated. Particle adders were studied by cycling the tool for more than 16000 times and measuring particle adders. Additionally, new methods, including on-tool wafer inspection and in-situ mask cleaning are being studied to further extend the replica mask life.", "Technologies for pattern fabrication using imprint process are being developed for various devices. Nanoimpirnt lithography (NIL) is an attractive and promising candidate for its pattern fidelity toward finer device fabrication without using double patterning. Layout and process dependent hotspots become a significant issue for application in smaller pattern size device and, design for manufacturing (DFM) flow comprising imprint process has to be prepared. Focusing on resist drop arrangement method as a process margin expansion knob, simulated non-fill defect is compared with experimental result. Finally, drop arrangement-related hot-spot extraction/modification flow utilizing total NIL simulation is proposed.", "Imprint lithography is a promising technology for replication of nano-scale features. For semiconductor device applications, Canon deposits a low viscosity resist on a field by field basis using jetting technology. A patterned mask is lowered into the resist fluid which then quickly flows into the relief patterns in the mask by capillary action. Following this filling step, the resist is crosslinked under UV radiation, and then the mask is removed, leaving a patterned resist on the substrate. There are two critical components to meeting throughput requirements for imprint lithography. The first component uses a similar approach to what is already done for many deposition and etch processes. Imprint stations can be clustered to enhance throughput. The FPA-1200NZ2C is a four station cluster system designed for high volume manufacturing. The second component is resist fill. For a single station, throughput includes overhead, resist dispense, resist fill time, exposure and separation. Resist exposure time and mask/wafer separation are well understood processing steps with typical durations on the order of 0.10 to 0.20 seconds. To achieve a total process throughput of 20 wafers per hour (wph) for a single station (or 80 wph for a four station NZ2C system), it is necessary to complete the fluid fill step in 1.1 seconds. There are several parameters that can impact resist filling. Key parameters include resist drop volume (smaller is better), system controls (which can impact spreading after jetting), Design for Imprint or DFI (to accelerate drop merging) and material engineering (to promote drop spreading after dispense). In addition, it is mandatory to maintain fast filling, even for edge field imprinting. In this paper, we address the improvements made in DFI and material engineering. By optimizing the drop pattern layout and introducing a two component resist system that enhances resist spreading, throughputs of 80 wafers per hour or more are achieved.", "In order to significantly reduce investment cost in lithography, nano imprint lithography (NIL) technology has aggressively been developed. Over the past few years, Toshiba, with the support of Canon and DNP, has developed NIL technology for the application of advanced memory devices and succeeded in yielding working devices at dimensions less than sub 20nm and beyond.\nA production tool in a mask house for template and NZ2 in Si fab were installed and ready for production. The pattern shrinkage for memory has just restarted for new memory such as storage class memory called SCM. The SADP and SAQP ArF multi-patterning with a spacer process may not be applied to the next-generation memory process due to thermal problems in semiconductor materials. Low-cost single exposure with NIL will be an ideal process. All exposure tools should be considered for extendability across different device nodes as an economical strategy.\nThe next application of NIL will be extend from contact hole and dense pattern without multi patterning to 3D pattering such like damascene process and to outside of semiconductor devices. In this paper, the status of the nano imprint lithography for high volume manufacturing is discussed, along with key challenges that must be addressed. Moreover, proprietary technology of NIL such as 3D and wide field patterning is discussed.", "Nanoimprint lithography manufacturing equipment utilizes a patterning technology that involves the field-by-field deposition and exposure of a low viscosity resist deposited by jetting technology onto the substrate.

Nano-imprint lithography (NIL) is one of the viable candidates.[1][2][3] NIL has been a promising solution to overcome the cost issue associated with expensive process and tool of multi patterning and EUVL. NIL is a simple technology and is capable of forming critical patterns easily. On the other hand, the critical issues of NIL are defectivity, overlay, and throughput. In order to introduce NIL into the High Volume Manufacturing (HVM), it is necessary to overcome these three challenges simultaneously.[4]-[10] In our previous study, we have reported improvement in NIL overlay, defectivity and throughput by the optimization of resist process on a pilot line tool, FPA-1200 NZ2C. In this study, we report recent evaluation of the NIL performance to judge its applicability in semiconductor device HVM. We have described that the NIL is getting closer to the target of HVM for 2x nm half pitch.[8]Defectivity level below 1pcs/cm2 has been achieved for the 2x nm half pitch L/S. The overlay accuracy of the test device is being improved down to 6nm or lower by introducing high order distortion correction.", "Field-effect gating with solid dielectrics is the basis for modern electronics. Electrolyte gating, however, offers far higher polarizations. Indeed, electrolyte gating has been a breakthrough to electrically induce numerous phase transitions in solids [1,2,3]. These experiments are all done by dripping mm-size drops of the electrolytes onto the active sample. Compared to integrated circuit technology this approach seems \u201cstone-age\u201d to us. These drops are open to the environment, and allow only for limited purity and reproducibility. Heterostructure electronic circuits have, up to now, been comprised of solid materials only. We have opened this materials space to also include liquids. We demonstrate integrated liquid capacitors and integrated liquid field effect devices which are of equal quality or even outperform standard, bulk devices. This work will accelerate discoveries based on electrolyte gating by providing a new platform, and opens a new area to exploit liquid/solid interfaces in integrated functional devices with technological promise.", "This paper address how additive manufacturing will revolutionize production and manufacturing industries, and ultimately determine the scope of what is possible to create. Due to its versatility, additive manufacturing will allow more efficient and cost-effective means of production, prototyping, and innovation. Additive manufacturing can create new parts and devices opening up new channels of change in emerging industries, such as microfluidics, medical, and dental. This evolution is equally as critical to private and public entities who desire a competitive edge over the manufacturing market, on both a national and global scale.\nDigital Light Projection (DLP) technology, kinetic absorption framework, and software algorithms constituted our basis for the engineering and design aspect of a custom method of additive manufacturing capable of meeting the demands of mass production. With the barriers mentioned above in mind, this device was built to compensate in accuracy, precision (>1 micron) and speed in the resolution of all areas of X, Y, Z orientations, coupled with a large build volume. Strategic algorithms were inserted into object fabrication to achieve parts with a superior surface finish and dimensional accuracy at rapid speeds (<5 mins per 50mm). For validation, we contrasted surface finish against other additive manufacturing solutions available on the market, using the same STL file.\nWe compared the printed parts under a microscope and identified statistically significant differences (p>0.001) between the finished products. Our method proved superior regarding dimensional accuracy and surface finish. The technology and methods applied in this paper are a step toward key gains in manufacturing-decreased production time, more efficient use of materials and personnel, and cost efficiency. As additive manufacturing evolves, it continues to shape the way humankind thinks about production, creation, and manufacturing while simultaneously expanding research opportunities in ways never before possible.", "Soft-lithography and nanoimprinting lithography have been critical in manufacturing 3D features with sub-20 nm resolution onto polymeric materials. However, methods for transferring 3D polymeric patterns (i.e. template) into silicon have relied upon the etch selectivity of the mask pattern during reactive ion etching, which in turn limits aspect-ratio, introduces shape distortions and introduces surface roughness via scalloping effects.\nTo tackle this problem, this paper demonstrates an electrochemical nanoimprinting process for single-crystal semiconductors for directly etching 3D features into silicon wafers without the need for templates or lithographical steps. It is shown that stamps made of porous catalysts used in the imprinting process allows for better morphology control of the imprinted silicon which is attributed to increased pathways for diffusion of chemical species during imprinting. This process delivers low-defect density, and large-area patterning (>1 cm2) in a single imprinting operation. Further, it outperforms the resolution and scalability of leading serial (e.g. FIB, electron beam) and parallel (e.g. gray-scale lithography) methods altogether, allowing for fast replication of patterns onto hard materials from a soft or polymeric mold. This technique bypasses the need for dry etching and is potentially compatible with roll-to-roll platforms, amorphous and poly silicon and III-V semiconductors. In turn, it may pave the way for mold replication onto hard molds and the manufacturing of complex objects for infrared optics.", "We will introduce SCIL as a full-wafer soft-stamp base nanoimprint technique with the advantages of being able to replicate sub-10nm features and perform overlay alignment with sub-micron precision over 200mm wafers. The combination of PDMS based soft stamps and an inorganic crosslinking imprint resist leads to a very long stamp lifetime of over 700 imprints, as demonstrated in the AutoSCIL 200 high volume production tool. Initial applications for wafer based NIL mainly required only a single, first mask, patterning step. For optical applications high refractive index material which can be directly patterned with high fidelity and low shrinkage are desired and initial results of inorganic resists that reach a refractive index of n=1.8 are demonstrated. As NIL and the applications develop, overlay alignment is the next step. Here we will discuss the developments ongoing to integrate wafer scale overlay alignment in the AutoSCIL production platform and which would achieve ~1 micrometer overlay alignment over 200mm wafers.

Furthermore, 3D patterns are transferred from the resist into a silicon substrate via reactive ion etching (RIE) and the resulting silicon master template is used for producing polymeric working stamps into OrmoStamp and, finally, replicas into optical grade OrmoClearFX material. Both replication strategies result in very high-quality replicas of the original patterns.", "Novel wafer stepper by using contact or proximity printing was developed. The ultraviolet region starts right after the violet end of the rainbow. In scientific terms, UV radiation is electromagnetic radiation just like visible light, radar signals and radio broadcast signals. Ultraviolet radiation can be broken down into three bands: UVA, UVB, and UVC. Projection wafer stepper needs use single wavelength as light sources, such as: g-line, i-line, KrF and ArF.

The tri-layer process with spin-on glass (SOG) and spin-on carbon (SOC) is mainly used for ArFi multi-patterning lithography process, in order to provide wide process window by suppressing substrate reflectivity as well as etch-transfer fine pattern to substrate by enhancement of etch selectivity. However, conventional tri-layer process in advanced node device has the critical issue on substrate damage in SOG removal process because of vulnerability of topography wafers which contain smaller pattern features and thinner ALD/CVD films.

This method iteratively modulates the shape of pattern by a feedback compensation mechanism until the simulated patterning fidelity satisfied specific constraints. A point spread function is utilized to account for all phenomena involved during the scattering events of incident ion beam particle in the resist. Patterning prediction for subsequent correction process is derived from the energy intensity distribution, as a result of convolution between the point spread function and the pattern, with an adequate threshold. The performance of this method for HIBL is examined through several designed patterns from 15- to 5-nm HP under certain process parameters, including acceleration voltage, resist thickness and sensitivity.

This work aims to manufacture split ring resonators into calixarene resist by using SPL, while plasma etching at cryogenic temperatures is applied for an efficient pattern transfer into the underlying Si layer. Such electromagnetic resonators take the form of a ring with a narrow gap, whose 2D array was the first left-handed material tailored to demonstrate the so-called left-hand behavior of the wave propagation. It is shown that the resonance frequency can be tuned with the feature size of the resonator, and the resonance frequency can be shifted further into near infrared or even visible light regions.", "Block copolymers (BCPs) can phase separate to form periodic structures with small spacings on the order of the polymer molecular size, thus making BCPs an attractive potential method for extending the resolution limits of optical lithography through various pitch subdivision techniques. In order to direct the self-assembly of BCP thin films, methods such as chemoepitaxy are employed which use the contrast between a chemically preferential pinning stripe and a more neutral background region to guide the phase separated features. Homopolymer is a known blending agent for BCPs that allows for the periodic spacing of their features (pitch, Lo) to be adjusted based on the concentration of homopolymer. This allows for less stringent tolerances on the molecular weight of the BCP in order to achieve a particular Lo. Addition of homopolymer is a relatively simple and potentially attractive method, but such blending may also a effect the resulting line edge and/or line width roughness in the DSA patterns. In this work, detailed molecular dynamics simulations of block copolymer directed self-assembly have been used to show how such behaviors and process performance factors are a effected by the symmetric addition of homopolymers (A and B) to a thin film lamellae forming BCP (A-b-B).", "In this paper, we propose a technique called time-varying frequency scanning (TVFS) to meet the challenges in killer defect inspection. The proposed technique enables the dynamic monitoring of defects by checking the hopping in the instantaneous frequency data and the classification of defect types by comparing the difference in frequencies. The TVFS technique utilizes the bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) method to separate the defect information from the sea of system errors. This significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and moreover, it potentially enables reference-free defect inspection.", "In this paper, we present a method for accurate EUV mask inspection of arbitrarily shaped absorber patterns using lensless imaging methods. With our reflective-mode EUV mask scanning lensless imaging microscope (RESCAN), we have imaged a mask with programmed defects and present here the computed defect map for both die-to-die and die-to-database pattern inspection. The signal-to-noise ratio in both cases was high enough to clearly isolate the defect from the structures (~13 for die-to-die and ~7 for die-to-database inspection). To reach the high-throughput required by industry, we implemented an extended ptychographic algorithm that allows for continuous scanning of the sample and subsequent deconvolution of the distortions in the incident illumination that are due to the fast stage movement. We will show how this algorithm was implemented on a multi-GPU platform for maximum performance that will eventually allow us to reach the final goal of 7 hours scan time for a full mask.", "In recent publications, our group has presented simulation studies that investigated the applicability of five ultraviolet inspection wavelengths for defect detection using a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based defect metric. All computations were performed using our in-house finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) Maxwell\u2019s equations solver. Initial simulations contained no perturbations except for the defect. In the absence of noise, the defects are readily apparent, and we therefore added Poisson noise both to the defect and no-defect simulated images that yield the differential image. For these noisy differential images, signal and noise were separated to calculate the SNR with two additional variables: an area threshold A_min and a noise threshold \u03c3. A wavelength dependent A_min (\u03bb) that scaled linearly with wavelength was required to enable comparison across all five wavelengths. All types of defects were best resolved using an inspection wavelength of \u03bb=47 nm assuming ideal conditions (i.e. no variation in numerical aperture or source intensity as a function of wavelength.) In this work, we add line edge roughness as \u201cwafer noise\u201d on both defect and no-defect geometries to test this SNR approach in a more realistic way. Various permutations of defect types, polarizations, illumination angles, focal planes and wavelengths affect the differential images produced differently. For every combination of the above mentioned experimental setups we individually maximize the SNR as a function of A_min and \u03c3 to improve defect detection, and trends across wavelengths are assessed. Finally, we present an alternative approach to the defect detection that is based on a neural network. We address questions of feature selection and its relation to the previous used SNR approach.", "A methodology to evaluate the electrical contact between nanowire (NW) and source/drain (SD) in NW FETs was investigated with SEM voltage contrast (VC). The electrical defects were robustly detected by VC. The validity of the inspection result was verified by TEM physical observations. Moreover, estimation of the parasitic resistance and capacitance was achieved from the quantitative analysis of VC images which were acquired with different scan conditions of electron beam (EB). A model considering the dynamics of EB-induce charging was proposed to calculate the VC. The resistance and capacitance can be determined by comparing the model-based VC with experimentally obtained VC. Quantitative estimation of resistance and capacitance would be valuable not only for more accurate inspection, but also for identification of the defect point.", "Through-focus optical microscopy (TSOM) with nanometer-scale lateral and vertical sensitivity levels matching those of scanning electron microscopy has been demonstrated to be useful both for 3D inspections and metrology assessments. In 2014, funded by two private companies (Nextin/Samsung Electronics) and the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT), a research team from four universities in South Korea set out to investigate core technologies for developing in-line TSOM inspection and metrology tools, with the respective teams focusing on optics implementation, defect inspection, computer simulation and high-speed metrology matching. We initially confirmed the reported validity of the TSOM operation through a computer simulation, after which we implemented the TSOM operation by throughfocus scanning of existing UV (355nm) and IR (800nm) inspection tools. These tools have an identical sampling distance of 150 nm but have different resolving distances (310 and 810 nm, respectively). We initially experienced some improvement in the defect inspection sensitivity level over TSV (through-silicon via) samples with ~ 6.6 \u03bcm diameters. However, during the experiment, we noted sensitivity and instability issues when attempting to acquire TSOM images. As TSOM 3D information is indirectly extracted by differentiating a target TSOM image from reference TSOM images, any instability or mismatch in imaging conditions can result in measurement errors. As a remedy to such a situation, we proposed the application of adaptive optics to the TSOM operation and developed a closed-loop system with a tip/tilt mirror and a Shack-Hartmann sensor on an optical bench. We were able to keep the plane position within in RMS 0.4 pixel by actively compensating for any position instability which arose during the TSOM scanning process along the optical axis. Currently, we are also developing another TSOM tool with a deformable mirror instead of a tip/tilt mirror, in which case we will not require any mechanical scanning.", "As semiconductor technology keeps moving forward, undeterred by the many challenges ahead, one specific deliverable is capturing the attention of many experts in the field: Line Width Roughness (LWR) specifications are expected to be less than 2nm in the near term, and to drop below 1nm in just a few years. This is a daunting challenge and engineers throughout the industry are trying to meet these targets using every means at their disposal. However, although current efforts are surely admirable, we believe they are not enough. The fact is that a specification has a meaning only if there is an agreed methodology to verify if the criterion is met or not. Such a standardization is critical in any field of science and technology and the question that we need to ask ourselves today is whether we have a standardized LWR metrology or not. In other words, if a single reference sample were provided, would everyone measuring it get reasonably comparable results? We came to realize that this is not the case and that the observed spread in the results throughout the industry is quite large. In our opinion, this makes the comparison of LWR data among institutions, or to a specification, very difficult. In this paper, we report the spread of measured LWR data across the semiconductor industry. We investigate the impact of image acquisition, measurement algorithm, and frequency analysis parameters on LWR metrology. We review critically some of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) metrology guidelines (such as measurement box length larger than 2\u03bcm and the need to correct for SEM noise). We compare the SEM roughness results to AFM measurements. Finally, we propose a standardized LWR measurement protocol - the imec Roughness Protocol (iRP) - intended to ensure that every time LWR measurements are compared (from various sources or to specifications), the comparison is sensible and sound. We deeply believe that the industry is at a point where it is imperative to guarantee that when talking about a critical parameter such like LWR, everyone speaks the same language, which is not currently the case.", "LER (Line Edge Roughness) and LWR (Line Width Roughness) of the semiconductor device are an important evaluation scale of the performance of the device. Conventionally, LER and LWR is evaluated from CD-SEM (Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope) images. However, CD-SEM measurement has a problem that high frequency random noise is large, and resolution is not sufficiently high. For random noise of CD-SEM measurement, some techniques are proposed. In these methods, it is necessary to set parameters for model and processing, and it is necessary to verify the correctness of these parameters using reference metrology. We have already proposed a novel reference metrology using FIB (Focused Ion Beam) process and planar-TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) method. In this study, we applied the proposed method to three new samples such as SAQP (Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning) FinFET device, EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) conventional resist, and EUV new material resist. LWR and PSD (Power Spectral Density) of LWR are calculated from the edge positions on planar-TEM images. We confirmed that LWR and PSD of LWR can be measured with high accuracy and evaluated the difference by the proposed method. Furthermore, from comparisons with PSD of the same sample by CD-SEM, the validity of measurement of PSD and LWR by CD-SEM can be verified.", "Nowadays, roughness control presents a huge challenge for the lithography step. For advanced nodes, this morphological aspect reaches the same order of magnitude than the Critical Dimension. Hence, the control of roughness needs an adapted metrology. In this study, specific samples with designed roughness have been manufactured using e-beam lithography. These samples have been characterized with three different methodologies: CD-SEM, OCD and SAXS. The main goal of the project is to compare the capability of each of these techniques in terms of reliability, type of information obtained, time to obtain the measurements and level of maturity for the industry.", "Line-edge roughness (LER) and linewidth roughness (LWR) in semiconductor processing are best characterized by the roughness power spectral density (PSD), or similar measures of roughness frequency and correlation. The PSD is generally thought to be described well by three parameters: standard deviation, correlation length, and PSD(0), the extrapolated zero frequency PSD. The next step toward enabling these metrics for pertinent industrial use is to understand how real metrology errors interact with these metrics and what should be optimized on the critical dimension scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) to improve error budgets. In this work, both images from multiple models of commercially-available CD-SEMs and from JMONSEL simulation of modeled roughened lines are used to better understand how various SEM algorithm choices, parameters, beam size/shape, and pixel size/scanning scheme influence SEM line edge uncertainty. Furthermore, how these errors interact with the above-listed PSD metrics will be explored, imparting knowledge for optimizing LER PSD measurement with minimized error. The Analytical Linescan Model (ALM) is a physics-based semi-empirical expression that predicts a SEM linescan given a specified wafer geometry. It can be calibrated to rigorous Monte Carlo simulations. Unlike Monte Carlo simulations, however, the analytical form of the ALM makes computational times very small. Inverting the ALM to produce an inverse linescan model allows wafer geometries to be estimated based on experimental linescan measurements. Thus, an inverse linescan model can be used as an edge detection algorithm for dimensional measurement directly from CD-SEM generated images. Here, an inverse linescan model will be tested as a potential CD, LER, and LWR measurement algorithm and compared to other conventional measurement algorithms.", "Measurement of line edge roughness (LER) is discussed from four aspects: edge detection, PSD prediction, sampling strategy, and noise mitigation, and general guidelines and practical solutions for LER measurement today are introduced. Advanced edge detection algorithms such as wave-matching method are shown effective for robustly detecting edges from low SNR images, while conventional algorithm with weak filtering is still effective in suppressing SEM noise and aliasing. Advanced PSD prediction method such as multi-taper method is effective in suppressing sampling noise within a line edge to analyze, while number of lines is still required for suppressing line to line variation. Two types of SEM noise mitigation methods, \"apparent noise floor\" subtraction method and LER-noise decomposition using regression analysis are verified to successfully mitigate SEM noise from PSD curves. These results are extended to LCDU measurement to clarify the impact of SEM noise and sampling noise on LCDU.", "This paper will provide an update to previous works [2][4][9] to our view of the future for in-line high volume manufacturing (HVM) metrology for the semiconductor industry, concentrating on logic technology for foundries. First, we will review of the needs of patterned defect, critical dimensional (CD/3D), overlay and films metrology, and present the extensive list of applications for which metrology solutions are needed. We will then update the industry\u2019s progress towards addressing gating technical limits of the most important of these metrology solutions, highlighting key metrology technology gaps requiring industry attention and investment.", "CD-SEMs are an indispensable part of semiconductor manufacturing. Extending their functionality beyond routine work on CD metrology of a layer is highly desirable. The etch process greatly depends on CDs and the pitch of a pattern. Through pitch patterns consisting of two layers, each with different CDs and side wall angles, are widely used to develop and characterize etch processes. TEMs are widely used to measure these values for each layer. This is a time consuming and expensive process, and the feedback time to process development is long. It would be highly desirable to develop metrology for two layers, including their side wall angles, using top down SEM images in order to reduce cost and provide a fast feedback to process development and characterization. A technique was developed to measure top and bottom CDs of each layer, as well as side wall angles of the layers using SEM images. The model based myCD software was used as the basis for this development. Hundreds of SEM images were taken at multiple test pattern areas with variable pitch and dimensions. The extracted values included top and bottom CDs of the top layer, top and bottom CDs of the bottom layer, as well as side wall angles of both layers. The pitch was also extracted for verification. The results of CDs and SWA were very consistent. The verification was done in two ways: a) by comparing myCD results to results from corresponding TEM images; and b) by analyzing the noise of the measured data. It is believed that the variation of CDs and SWAs on the through pitch pattern was consistent with the designed pattern layout and their variation from the design due to process variation should be smooth. Both verifications confirmed excellent results of metrology. In particular, the repeatability of SWA measurements from top down images was found to be 0.4 degrees, a 3-sigma variation. There is no other method to our knowledge to measure SWA from top down images.", "With increasingly 3D devices becoming the norm, there is a growing need in the semiconductor industry and in materials science for high spatial resolution, non-destructive metrology techniques capable of determining depth-dependent composition information on devices. We present a solution to this problem using ptychographic coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) implemented using a commercially available, tabletop 13 nm source. We present the design, simulations, and preliminary results from our new complex EUV imaging reflectometer, which uses coherent 13 nm light produced by tabletop high harmonic generation. This tool is capable of determining spatially-resolved composition vs. depth profiles for samples by recording ptychographic images at multiple incidence angles. By harnessing phase measurements, we can locally and nondestructively determine quantities such as device and thin film layer thicknesses, surface roughness, interface quality, and dopant concentration profiles. Using this advanced imaging reflectometer, we can quantitatively characterize materials-sciencerelevant and industry-relevant nanostructures for a wide variety of applications, spanning from defect and overlay metrology to the development and optimization of nano-enhanced thermoelectric or spintronic devices.", "Using a tabletop coherent extreme ultraviolet source, we extend current nanoscale metrology capabilities with applications spanning from new models of nanoscale transport and materials, to nanoscale device fabrication. We measure the ultrafast dynamics of acoustic waves in materials; by analyzing the material\u2019s response, we can extract elastic properties of films as thin as 11nm. We extend this capability to a spatially resolved imaging modality by using coherent diffractive imaging to image the acoustic waves in nanostructures as they propagate. This will allow for spatially resolved characterization of the elastic properties of non-isotropic materials.", "Image Based Overlay (IBO) measurement is one of the most common techniques used in Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing to extract the overlay error values. The overlay error is measured using dedicated overlay targets which are optimized to increase the accuracy and the resolution, but these features are much larger than the IC feature size. IBO measurements are realized on the dedicated targets instead of product features, because the current overlay metrology solutions, mainly based on optics, cannot provide sufficient resolution on product features. However, considering the fact that the overlay error tolerance is approaching 2 nm, the overlay error measurement on product features becomes a need for the industry. For sub-nanometer resolution metrology, Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is widely used, though at the cost of very low throughput. The semiconductor industry is interested in non-destructive imaging of buried structures under one or more layers for the application of overlay and wafer alignment, specifically through optically opaque media. Recently an SPM technique has been developed for imaging subsurface features which can be potentially considered as a solution for overlay metrology. In this paper we present the use of Subsurface Ultrasonic Resonance Force Microscopy (SSURFM) used for IBO measurement. We used SSURFM for imaging the most commonly used overlay targets on a silicon substrate and photoresist. As a proof of concept we have imaged surface and subsurface structures simultaneously. The surface and subsurface features of the overlay targets are fabricated with programmed overlay errors of \u00b140 nm, \u00b120 nm, and 0 nm. The top layer thickness changes between 30 nm and 80 nm. Using SSURFM the surface and subsurface features were successfully imaged and the overlay errors were extracted, via a rudimentary image processing algorithm. The measurement results are in agreement with the nominal values of the programmed overlay errors.", "The advance of the semiconductor industry requires new metrology methods, which can deal with smaller and more complex nanostructures. Particularly for inline metrology a rapid, sensitive and non destructive method is needed. Small angle X-ray scattering under grazing incidence has already been investigated for this application and delivers significant statistical information which tracks the profile parameters as well as their variations, i.e. roughness. However, it suffers from the elongated footprint at the sample. The advantage of EUV radiation, with its longer wavelengths, is that larger incidence angles can be used, resulting in a significant reduction of the beam footprint. Targets with field sizes of 100 \u03bcm and smaller are accessible with our experimental set-up. We present a new experimental tool for the measurement of small structures based on the capabilities of soft X-ray and EUV scatterometry at the PTB soft X-ray beamline at the electron storage ring BESSY II. PTB\u2019s soft X-ray radiometry beamline uses a plane grating monochromator, which covers the spectral range from 0.7 nm to 25 nm and was especially designed to provide highly collimated radiation. An area detector covers the scattered radiation from a grazing exit angle up to an angle of 30\u00b0 above the sample horizon and the fluorescence emission can be detected with an energy dispersive X-ray silicon drift detector. In addition, the sample can be rotated and linearly moved in vacuum. This new set-up will be used to explore the capabilities of EUV-scatterometry for the characterization of nanometre-sized structures.", "In this paper, we present an electromagnetic full-wave modeling framework, as a support EM tool providing data sets for X-ray ptychographic imaging. Modeling the entire scattering problem with Finite Element Method (FEM) tools is, in fact, a prohibitive task, because of the large area illuminated by the beam (due to the poor focusing power at these wavelengths) and the very small features to be imaged. To overcome this problem, the spectrum of the illumination beam is decomposed into a discrete set of plane waves. This allows reducing the electromagnetic modeling volume to the one enclosing the area to be imaged. The total scattered field is reconstructed by superimposing the solutions for each plane wave illumination.", "Nondestructive subsurface nanoimaging through optically opaque media is considered to be extremely challenging and is essential for several semiconductor metrology applications including overlay and alignment and buried void and defect characterization. The current key challenge in overlay and alignment is the measurement of targets that are covered by optically opaque layers. Moreover, with the device dimensions moving to the smaller nodes and the issue of the so-called loading effect causing offsets between between targets and product features, it is increasingly desirable to perform alignment and overlay on product features or so-called on-cell overlay, which requires higher lateral resolution than optical methods can provide. Our recently developed technique known as SubSurface Ultrasonic Resonance Force Microscopy (SSURFM) has shown the capability for high-resolution imaging of structures below a surface based on (visco-)elasticity of the constituent materials and as such is a promising technique to perform overlay and alignment with high resolution in upcoming production nodes. In this paper, we describe the developed SSURFM technique and the experimental results on imaging buried features through various layers and the ability to detect objects with resolution below 10 nm. In summary, the experimental results show that the SSURFM is a potential solution for on-cell overlay and alignment as well as detecting buried defects or voids and generally metrology through optically opaque layers.", "In overlay (OVL) metrology the quality of measurements and the resulting reported values depend heavily on the measurement setup used. For example, in scatterometry OVL (SCOL) metrology a specific target may be measured with multiple illumination setups, including several apodization options, two possible laser polarizations, and multiple possible laser wavelengths. Not all possible setups are suitable for the metrology method as different setups can yield significantly different performance in terms of the accuracy and robustness of the reported OVL values. Finding an optimal measurement setup requires great flexibility in measurement, to allow for high-resolution landscape mapping (mapping the dependence of OVL, other metrics, and details of pupil images on measurement setup). This can then be followed by a method for analyzing the landscape and selecting an accurate and robust measurement setup. The selection of an optimal measurement setup is complicated by the sensitivity of metrology to variations in the fabrication process (process variations) such as variations in layer thickness or in the properties of target symmetry. The metrology landscape changes with process variations and maintaining optimal performance might require continuous adjustments of the measurement setup. Here we present a method for the selection and adjustment of an optimal measurement setup. First, the landscape is measured and analyzed to calculate theory-based accurate OVL values as well as quality metrics which depend on details of the pupil image. These OVL values and metrics are then used as an internal ruler (\u201cself-reference\u201d), effectively eliminating the need for an external reference such as CD-SEM. Finally, an optimal measurement setup is selected by choosing a setup which yields the same OVL values as the self-reference and is also robust to small changes in the landscape. We present measurements which show how a SCOL landscape changes within wafer, wafer to wafer, and lot to lot with intentionally designed process variations between. In this case the process variations cause large shifts in the SCOL landscape and it is not possible to find a common optimal measurement setup for all wafers. To deal with such process variations we adjust the measurement setup as needed. Initially an optimal setup is chosen based on the first wafer. For subsequent wafers the process stability is continuously monitored. Once large process variations are detected the landscape information is used for selecting a new measurement setup, thereby maintaining optimal accuracy and robustness. Methods described in this work are enabled by the ATL (Accurate Tunable Laser) scatterometry-based overlay metrology system.", "Ever increasing need for tighter on-product overlay (OPO), as well as enhanced accuracy in overlay metrology and methodology, is driving semiconductor industry\u2019s technologists to innovate new approaches to OPO measurements. In case of High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) fabs, it is often critical to strive for both accuracy and robustness. Robustness, in particular, can be challenging in metrology since overlay targets can be impacted by proximity of other structures next to the overlay target (asymmetric effects), as well as symmetric stack changes such as photoresist height variations. Both symmetric and asymmetric contributors have impact on robustness. Furthermore, tweaking or optimizing wafer processing parameters for maximum yield may have an adverse effect on physical target integrity. As a result, measuring and monitoring physical changes or process abnormalities/artefacts in terms of new Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is crucial for the end goal of minimizing true in-die overlay of the integrated circuits (ICs). IC manufacturing fabs often relied on CD-SEM in the past to capture true in-die overlay. Due to destructive and intrusive nature of CD-SEMs on certain materials, it\u2019s desirable to characterize asymmetry effects for overlay targets via inline KPIs utilizing YieldStar (YS) metrology tools. These KPIs can also be integrated as part of (\u03bcDBO) target evaluation and selection for final recipe flow. In this publication, the Holistic Metrology Qualification (HMQ) flow was extended to account for process induced (asymmetric) effects such as Grating Imbalance (GI) and Bottom Grating Asymmetry (BGA). Local GI typically contributes to the intrafield OPO whereas BGA typically impacts the interfield OPO, predominantly at the wafer edge. Stack height variations highly impact overlay metrology accuracy, in particular in case of multi-layer LithoEtch Litho-Etch (LELE) overlay control scheme. Introducing a GI impact on overlay (in nm) KPI check quantifies the grating imbalance impact on overlay, whereas optimizing for accuracy using self-reference captures the bottom grating asymmetry effect. Measuring BGA after each process step before exposure of the top grating helps to identify which specific step introduces the asymmetry in the bottom grating. By evaluating this set of KPI's to a BEOL LELE overlay scheme, we can enhance robustness of recipe selection and target selection. Furthermore, these KPIs can be utilized to highlight process and equipment abnormalities. In this work, we also quantified OPO results with a self-contained methodology called Triangle Method. This method can be utilized for LELE layers with a common target and reference. This allows validating general \u03bcDBO accuracy, hence reducing the need for CD-SEM verification.", "One of the metrology challenges for massively parallel electron beams is to verify that all the beams that are used perform within specification. The Mapper FLX-1200 platform exposes fields horizontally segmented in 2.2 \u03bcm-wide stripes. This yields two parameters of interest: overlay is the registration error with respect to a previous layer, and stitching is the registration error between the stripes. This paper presents five novel overlay targets and one novel stitching target tailored for Mapper\u2019s needs and measured on KLA-Tencor Archer 600 image based overlay (IBO) platform. The targets have been screened by exposure of a variable shaped electron beam lithography machine (Vistec VSB 3054 DW) on two different stacks: resist-to-resist and resist-to-etched silicon, both as a trilayer stack. These marks attain a total measurement uncertainty (TMU) down to 0.3 nm and move-and-measure (MAM) time down to 0.3 seconds for both stacks. The stitching targets have an effective TMU of 0.4 nm and a MAM time of 0.75 seconds. In a follow up experiment, the two best performing overlay targets have been incorporated in an exposure by a Mapper FLX-1200. With the new stack a TMU of 0.3 nm and MAM time of 0.35 s have been attained. For 107 out of 140 selected stripes the slope was constant within 2.5%, the offset smaller than 0.5 nm and correlation coefficient R2 > 0.98.", "This paper demonstrates the improvement using the YieldStar S-1250D small spot, high-NA, after-etch overlay in-device measurements in a DRAM HVM environment. It will be demonstrated that In-device metrology (IDM) captures after-etch device fingerprints more accurately compared to the industry-standard CDSEM. Also, IDM measurements (acquiring both CD and overlay) can be executed significantly faster increasing the wafer sampling density that is possible within a realistic metrology budget. The improvements to both speed and accuracy open the possibility of extended modeling and correction capabilities for control. The proof-book data of this paper shows a 36% improvement of device overlay after switching to control in a DRAM HVM environment using indevice metrology.", "Accuracy of patterning impacts yield, IC performance and technology time to market. Accuracy of patterning relies on optical proximity correction (OPC) models built using CD-SEM inputs and intra die critical dimension (CD) control based on CD-SEM. Sub-nanometer measurement uncertainty (MU) of CD-SEM is required for current technologies. Reported design and process related bias variation of CD-SEM is in the range of several nanometers. Reference metrology and numerical modeling are used to correct SEM. Both methods are slow to be used for real time bias correction. We report on real time CD-SEM bias correction using empirical models based on reference metrology (RM) data. Significant amount of currently untapped information (sidewall angle, corner rounding, etc.) is obtainable from SEM waveforms. Using additional RM information provided for specific technology (design rules, materials, processes) CD extraction algorithms can be pre-built and then used in real time for accurate CD extraction from regular CD-SEM images. The art and challenge of SEM modeling is in finding robust correlation between SEM waveform features and bias of CD-SEM as well as in minimizing RM inputs needed to create accurate (within the design and process space) model. The new approach was applied to improve CD-SEM accuracy of 45 nm GATE and 32 nm MET1 OPC 1D models. In both cases MU of the state of the art CD-SEM has been improved by 3x and reduced to a nanometer level. Similar approach can be applied to 2D (end of line, contours, etc.) and 3D (sidewall angle, corner rounding, etc.) cases.", "In recent years, the combination of device scaling, complex 3D device architecture and tightening process tolerances have strained the capabilities of optical metrology tools to meet process needs. Two main categories of approaches have been taken to address the evolving process needs. In the first category, new hardware configurations are developed to provide more spectral sensitivity. Most of this category of work will enable next generation optical metrology tools to try to maintain pace with next generation process needs. In the second category, new innovative algorithms have been pursued to increase the value of the existing measurement signal. These algorithms aim to boost sensitivity to the measurement parameter of interest, while reducing the impact of other factors that contribute to signal variability but are not influenced by the process of interest. This paper will evaluate the suitability of machine learning to address high volume manufacturing metrology requirements in both front end of line (FEOL) and back end of line (BEOL) sectors from advanced technology nodes. In the FEOL sector, initial feasibility has been demonstrated to predict the fin CD values from an inline measurement using machine learning. In this study, OCD spectra were acquired after an etch process that occurs earlier in the process flow than where the inline CD is measured. The fin hard mask etch process is known to impact the downstream inline CD value. Figure 1 shows the correlation of predicted CD vs downstream inline CD measurement obtained after the training of the machine learning algorithm. For BEOL, machine learning is shown to provide an additional source of information in prediction of electrical resistance from structures that are not compatible for direct copper height measurement. Figure 2 compares the trench height correlation to electrical resistance (Rs) and the correlation of predicted Rs to the e-test Rs value for a far back end of line (FBEOL) metallization level across 3 products. In the case of product C, it is found that the predicted Rs correlation to the e-test value is significantly improved utilizing spectra acquired at the e-test structure. This paper will explore the considerations required to enable use of machine learning derived metrology output to enable improved process monitoring and control. Further results from the FEOL and BEOL sectors will be presented, together with further discussion on future proliferation of machine learning based metrology solutions in high volume manufacturing.", "A key sensor element in a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is the read-write head device. The device is complex 3D shape and its fabrication requires over thousand process steps with many of them being various types of image inspection and critical dimension (CD) metrology steps. In order to have high yield of devices across a wafer, very tight inspection and metrology specifications are implemented. Many images are collected on a wafer and inspected for various types of defects and in CD metrology the quality of image impacts the CD measurements. Metrology noise need to be minimized in CD metrology to get better estimate of the process related variations for implementing robust process controls. Though there are specialized tools available for defect inspection and review allowing classification and statistics. However, due to unavailability of such advanced tools or other reasons, many times images need to be manually inspected. SEM Image inspection and CD-SEM metrology tools are different tools differing in software as well. SEM Image inspection and CD-SEM metrology tools are separate tools differing in software and purpose. There have been cases where a significant numbers of CD-SEM images are blurred or have some artefact and there is a need for image inspection along with the CD measurement. Tool may not report a practical metric highlighting the quality of image. Not filtering CD from these blurred images will add metrology noise to the CD measurement. An image classifier can be helpful here for filtering such data. This paper presents the use of artificial intelligence in classifying the SEM images. Deep machine learning is used to train a neural network which is then used to classify the new images as blurred and not blurred. Figure 1 shows the image blur artefact and contingency table of classification results from the trained deep neural network. Prediction accuracy of 94.9 % was achieved in the first model. Paper covers other such applications of the deep neural network in image classification for inspection, review and metrology.", "Multi-channel gate all around (GAA) semiconductor devices require measurements of more target parameters than FinFET devices, due in part to the increased complexity of the different structures needed to fabricate nanosheet devices. In some cases, multiple measurement techniques are required to be used in a hybrid-metrology technique in order to properly extract the necessary information. Optical scatterometry (optical critical dimension, or OCD) is an inline metrology technique which is used to measure the geometrical profile of the structure, but it may not ordinarily be sensitive to very small residues. X-ray based metrologies, such as x-ray fluorescence (XRF) can be used to identify which materials are present in the structure, but are not able to measure profile information for complex 3D structures. This paper reviews a critical etch process step, where neither OCD nor XRF can extract all of the necessary information about the structure on their own, but, when hybridized, are able to provide enough information to solve the application. In GAA structures, the nanosheets are formed from alternating layers of thin SiGe and Si layers which are deposited on a bulk Si substrate. To form the nFET channel, the SiGe must be removed. However, in some cases, there is still remaining SiGe residue on the surface of the Si nanosheets, present in small amounts that are difficult to measure with conventional OCD. Additionally, it is desirable to know at which level of the stacked nanosheets the residue is present. In order to properly characterize the amount of SiGe remaining, data from both OCD and XRF are used. By measuring before and after the etch, the XRF can calculate the percentage of SiGe that is remaining after the etch. This percentage can be used as a constraint in the OCD model to allow the OCD to accurately measure the amount of SiGe, and to enable the OCD model to identify the location of the residue.", "As device scaling continues, controlling defect densities on the wafer becomes essential for high volume manufacturing (HVM). One type of defect, the non-selective SiGe nodule, becomes more difficult to control during SiGe epitaxy (EPI) growth for p-type field effect transistor (pFET) source and drain. The process window for SiGe EPI growth with low nodule density becomes extremely tight due to the shrinking of contact poly pitch (CPP). Any tiny process shift or incoming structure shift could introduce a high density of nodules, which could affect device performance and yield. The current defect inspection method has a low throughput, so a fast and quantitative characterization technique is preferred for measuring and monitoring this type of defect. Scatterometry is a fast and non-destructive in-line metrology technique. In this work, novel methods were developed to accurately and comprehensively measure the SiGe nodules with scatterometry information. Top-down critical dimension scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) images were collected and analyzed on the same location as scatterometry measurement for calibration. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to analyze the correlation between the raw spectra and defect density and area fraction. The analysis showed that the defect density and area fractions can be measured separately by correlating intensity variations. In addition to the defect density and area fraction, we also investigate a novel method \u2013 model-based scatterometry hybridized with machine learning capabilities \u2013 to quantify the average height of the defects along the sidewall of the gate. Hybridizing the machine learning method with the model-based one could also eliminate the possibility of misinterpreting the defect as some structural parameters. Furthermore, cross-sectional TEM and SEM measurement are used to calibrate the model-based scatterometry results. In this work, the correlation between the SiGe nodule defects and the structural parameters of the device is also studied. The preliminary result shows that there is strong correlation between the defect density and spacer thickness. Correlations between the defect density and the structural parameters provides useful information for process engineers to optimize the EPI growth process. With the advances in the scatterometry-based defect measurement metrology, we demonstrate such fast, quantitative, and comprehensive measurement of SiGe nodule defects can be used to improve the throughput and yield.", "Monitoring of pattern roughness for advanced technology nodes is crucial as this roughness can adversely affect device yield and degrade device performance. The main industry work horse for in-line roughness measurements is the CD-SEM, however, today no adequate reference metrology tools exist that allow to evaluate its roughness measurement sensitivity and precision. To bridge this gap, in this work the roughness measurement capabilities of different analytical techniques are investigated. Different metrology methods are used to evaluate roughness on a same set of samples and results are compared and used in a holistic approach to better characterize and quantify the measured pattern roughness. To facilitate the correlation between the various metrology techniques and the evaluation of CD-SEM sensitivity, an effective approach is to induce pattern roughness in a controlled way by adding well defined levels of roughness to the designed patterns on a EUV mask and to measure the response and sensitivity of CD-SEM and of the other techniques to these different pattern roughness levels once printed on wafers. This paper presents the roughness measurement results obtained with various metrology technologies including CD-SEM, OCD, S-TEM and XCD on EUV Lithography patterned wafers both postlithography and post-etch. The benefits of recently developed metrology enhancements are demonstrated as well; automated TEM allows to generate accurate and rather precise reference roughness data, Machine Learning enables OCD based roughness metrology with good correlation to CD-SEM and STEM, and the improved sensitivity of EUV and X-ray scattering systems allows to extract roughness information that does correlate to CD-SEM.", "With the advent of high brightness sources and fast detectors, there is a possibility for combining fast X-ray acquisition with high-speed data treatment to reach the timescale for an effective in-line characterization method. We will highlight two recent developments using Small Angle X-ray Scattering on nanoscale etched patterns: the first is the inclusion of a CD-SAXS tool, allowing the data treatment and simulations to reconstruct the form-factor, inside the Xi-cam framework; the second is the development of a high performance Grazing Incidence approach to reconstruct the shape of line profile. This study also shows the comparison between the line profiles reconstructed from both techniques as well as the profile extracted from cross-section SEM.", "Hybrid and data feed forward methodologies are well established for advanced optical process control solutions in highvolume semiconductor manufacturing. Appropriate information from previous measurements, transferred into advanced optical model(s) at following step(s), provides enhanced accuracy and exactness of the measured topographic (thicknesses, critical dimensions, etc.) and material parameters. In some cases, hybrid or feed-forward data are missed or invalid for dies or for a whole wafer. We focus on approaches of virtual metrology to re-create hybrid or feed-forward data inputs in high-volume manufacturing. We discuss missing data inputs reconstruction which is based on various interpolation and extrapolation schemes and uses information about wafer\u2019s process history. Moreover, we demonstrate data reconstruction approach based on machine learning techniques utilizing optical model and measured spectra. And finally, we investigate metrics that allow one to assess error margin of virtual data input.", "Data storage capacity of hard drive disks (HDD) has been increased over time. Partly this has been achieved by shrinking the dimensions of magnetic writing device also called the \u201cmain Pole\u201d, a key magnetic flux emanating component in the slider that hovers over the magnetic media disk writing bits in nanoscale magnetic domains along the circular tracks. Even though the writer pole device is a single isolated device, its 3D shape and material composition are quite complex and critical dimensions are sub-50 nm. The reliability and accuracy of writing data in bits of magnetic nano-domains depends on the precise control of the pole shape and dimensions. Its fabrication requires over thousand process steps with many of them being various types of metrology steps. Final shape or back-end shape of the pole is influenced by various process steps and related information is captured by the subsequent metrology. Overlay, optical (thin film thickness using ellipsometry, topography using white light interferometry), CD-SEM, CD-AFM and inline FIB cross sections based metrology is commonly used. All this metrology data during fabrication process is called wafer metrology data. The data about the shape of the pole after device fabrication (lapping) is called back-end data and is obtained by cross section using FIB and SEM. Few device chips are sent ahead to determine the lapping parameters which takes time. This paper is about predicting the back-end shape parameters namely, pole height (PH), pole width (PW), and pole angle (PA), based on wafer data so that the backend metrology process requiring send-ahead can be optimized or even eliminated. Predictive models using machine learning and analytics techniques (neural networks, multivariate regression, and principal components analysis) have been studied and results will be presented and discussed in this paper. In this metrology centric data science study various steps have been pursued from the beginning to retrieve, integrate, transform, model, visualize data and understand the outcomes. Wafer data corresponding to more than seventy different parameters was used in this study. It is not possible to have all metrology data for each device as some techniques are destructive, imputation technique based on nearest neighbour data points is used. Model was trained and validated on a set of data and tested on an independent new data. Based on testing on independent data, study concludes that it is possible to train the model on data from few wafers for technology in production and predict the back-end pole shape parameters with acceptable accuracy for upcoming wafers. This could be very useful in reducing cycle time by minimizing the need for send ahead wafer components and optimizing the tuning of lapping process. Correlation of predicted (Y-axis) and measured (X-axis) values of PW parameters for four wafers is plotted in figure 1 at device level, flash field or exposure field level, and wafer level. The correlation between predicted and measured PW is reasonable for making use of the predictive model at the flash field level and wafer level to optimize the need for send ahead and determine the lapping parameters at back-end process.", "In contrast to semiconductor manufacturing where features are mostly lines or contact holes, the disk drive reader has a complex, nonlinear 3D geometry. Metrology of such geometries is challenging; especially with regard to repeatability of measurements. New methods were needed to keep up with production requirements for metrology regarding uncertainty of critical dimensions (CD). We report a new method developed for CD metrology of the disk drive writer pole. The method demonstrated improved uncertainties compared to the regularly used CD-SEM algorithms and also has capability for side wall angle (SWA) metrology for process control. The method utilizes multiple steps: a) extract contours from SEM images, b) identify exact locations on a curvilinear feature where CD should be measured, and c) provide CD measurements at these locations. SEM images from a variety of production wafers were used for evaluation of the developed method. Multiple series of SEM images were processed using a software utilizing advanced algorithms without using regular brightness threshold CD-SEM methodologies. It was found that CD repeatability was improved by a factor of three compared to the results of the regular threshold based CD-SEM method. TEM imaging is used to measure side wall angle; it takes a lot of efforts for sample preparation and the feedback is slow. If extraction of SWA is possible from top down SEM images it would provide instant feedback to manufacturing and reduce cost. Monte Carlo simulations were used to understand the sensitivity of SWA to the trench CD and depth. Height of features was measured using AFM. A method to extract SWA from top down images was developed. Numerous SEM images were processed; results were compared to experiment and analyzed. It was shown that the 3-sigma repeatability of SWA measurement was 0.15 degree. It was also found that the left and the right SWA were different on multiple wafers, the results were very consistent from one image series to another one, at the same time the SWA difference between the left and right walls was considerably larger than the uncertainty of SWA measurement.", "The interpretation of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the latest semiconductor devices is not intuitive and requires comparison with computed images based on theoretical modeling and simulations. For quantitative image prediction and geometrical reconstruction of the specimen structure, the accuracy of the physical model is essential. In this paper, we review the current models of electron-solid interaction and discuss their accuracy. We perform the comparison of the simulated results with our experiments of SEM overlay of under-layer, grain imaging of copper interconnect, and hole bottom visualization by angular selective detectors, and show that our model well reproduces the experimental results. Remaining issues for quantitative simulation are also discussed, including the accuracy of the charge dynamics, treatment of beam skirt, and explosive increase in computing time.", "Charging of insulators is a complex phenomenon to simulate since the accuracy of the simulations is very sensitive to the interaction of electrons with matter and electric fields. In this study, we report model improvements for a previously developed Monte-Carlo simulator to more accurately simulate samples that charge. The improvements include both modelling of low energy electron scattering and charging of insulators. The new first-principle scattering models provide a more realistic charge distribution cloud in the material, and a better match between non-charging simulations and experimental results. Improvements on charging models mainly focus on redistribution of the charge carriers in the material with an induced conductivity (EBIC) and a breakdown model, leading to a smoother distribution of the charges. Combined with a more accurate tracing of low energy electrons in the electric field, we managed to reproduce the dynamically changing charging contrast due to an induced positive surface potential.", "Metrology plays an important role in edge placement error (EPE) budgeting. Control for multi-patterning applications as new critical distances needs to be measured (edge to edge) and requirements become tighter and tighter in terms of accuracy and precision. In this paper we focus on imec iN7 BEOL platform and particularly on M2 patterning scheme using SAQP + block EUV for a 7.5 track logic design. Being able to characterize block to SAQP edge misplacement is important in a budgeting exercise (1) but is also extremely difficult due to challenging edge detection with CD-SEM (similar materials, thin layers, short distances, 3D features). In this study we develop an advanced solution to measure block to SAQP placement, we characterize it in terms of sensitivity, precision and accuracy through the comparison to reference metrology. In a second phase, the methodology is applied to budget local effects and the results are compared to the characterization of the SAQP and block independently.", "The influence of e-beam aperture angle on CD-SEM measurements for a high aspect ratio (HAR) structure was investigated. The Monte-Carlo simulator JMONSEL was used to evaluate the measurement sensitivity to the variation in the bottom CD. The aperture angle of the primary electron greatly influences the measurement accuracy of the bottom CD in the HAR structure. Then, we utilized a technique for energy-angular selective detection to the Monte-Carlo simulation results and found that the measurement sensitivity for the large aperture angle was improved. In addition, the experimental results were qualitatively consistent with the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation. These results indicate that the detection is effective for the bottom CD measurement of a HAR structure.", "The importance of traditionally acceptable sources of variation has started to become more critical as semiconductor technologies continue to push into smaller technology nodes. New metrology techniques are needed to pursue the process uniformity requirements needed for controllable lithography. Process control for lithography has the advantage of being able to adjust for cross-wafer variability, but this requires that all processes are close in matching between process tools/chambers for each process. When this is not the case, the cumulative line variability creates identifiable groups of wafers1 . This cumulative shape based effect is described as impacting overlay measurements and alignment by creating misregistration of the overlay marks. It is necessary to understand what requirements might go into developing a high volume manufacturing approach which leverages this grouping methodology, the key inputs and outputs, and what can be extracted from such an approach. It will be shown that this line variability can be quantified into a loss of electrical yield primarily at the edge of the wafer and proposes a methodology for root cause identification and improvement. This paper will cover the concept of wafer shape based grouping as a diagnostic tool for overlay control and containment, the challenges in implementing this in a manufacturing setting, and the limitations of this approach. This will be accomplished by showing that there are identifiable wafer shape based signatures. These shape based wafer signatures will be shown to be correlated to overlay misregistration, primarily at the edge. It will also be shown that by adjusting for this wafer shape signal, improvements can be made to both overlay as well as electrical yield. These improvements show an increase in edge yield, and a reduction in yield variability.", "Derivative technology like embedded Non-Volatile Memories (eNVM) is raising new types of challenges on the \u201cmore than Moore\u201d path. By its construction: overlay is critical across multiple layers, by its running mode: usage of high voltage are stressing leakages and breakdown, and finally with its targeted market: Automotive, Industry automation, secure transactions\u2026 which are all requesting high device reliability (typically below 1ppm level). As a consequence, overlay specifications are tights, not only between one layer and its reference, but also among the critical layers sharing the same reference. This work describes a broad picture of the key points for multilayer overlay process control in the case of a 28nm FD-SOI technology and its derivative flows. First, the alignment trees of the different flow options have been optimized using a realistic process assumptions calculation for indirect overlay. Then, in the case of a complex alignment tree involving heterogeneous scanner toolset, criticality of tool matching between reference layer and critical layers of the flow has been highlighted. Improving the APC control loops of these multilayer dependencies has been studied with simulations of feed-forward as well as implementing new rework algorithm based on multi-measures. Finally, the management of these measurement steps raises some issues for inline support and using calculations or \u201cvirtual overlay\u201d could help to gain some tool capability. A first step towards multilayer overlay process control has been taken.", "Overlay is one of the most critical process control steps of semiconductor manufacturing technology. A typical advanced scheme includes an overlay feedback loop based on after litho optical imaging overlay metrology on scribeline targets. The after litho control loop typically involves high frequency sampling: every lot or nearly every lot. An after etch overlay metrology step is often included, at a lower sampling frequency, in order to characterize and compensate for bias. The after etch metrology step often involves CD-SEM metrology, in this case in-cell and ondevice. This work explores an alternative approach using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) metrology and a machine learning analysis technique. Advanced 1x nm DRAM wafers were prepared, including both nominal (POR) wafers with mean overlay offsets, as well as DOE wafers with intentional across wafer overlay modulation. After litho metrology was measured using optical imaging metrology, as well as after etch metrology using both SE and CD-SEM for comparison. We investigate 2 types of machine learning techniques with SE data: model-less and model-based, showing excellent performance for after etch in-cell on-device overlay metrology.", "Numerical simulation of overlay metrology targets has become a de-facto standard in advanced technology nodes. While appropriate simulation software is widely available in the industry alongside with metrics that allow selection of the best performing targets, the model validation tools are less developed. We present an approach of numerical model validation based on the comparison between target simulation results and on-product overlay measurements. A \u201csimulation-tomeasurement\u201d software is used in this work to compare the performance metrics and accuracy flags of scatterometrybased overlay targets designed using KLA-Tencor AcuRate\u2122 simulator for the critical layers of 12nm FD-SOI FEOL stack and 22nm FD-SOI BEOL stack. We demonstrate how simulation-to-measurement matching enabled us to verify the model, identify discrepancies between the model and the product stack and build an improved model that correctly describes the target. The refined target stack was used for image-based overlay target simulations that allowed us to obtain better performing optical overlay targets as well."], "conclusion": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
